came unto the valley of eshcol and search it out 

1 25 and they took of the fruit of the land in their hand and 
brought it down unto u and brought u word again and said it is a 
good land which the lord our god doth give u 

1 26 notwithstand ye would not go up but rebel against the 
command of the lord your god 1 27 and ye murmur in your tent 
and said becau the lord hate u he hath brought u forth out of 
the land of egypt to deliv u into the hand of the amorit to

and in the wilder where thou hast seen how that the lord thi god

3 28 but charg joshua and encourag him and strengthen him for he 
shall go over befor thi peopl and he shall cau them to inherit 
the land which thou shalt see 

3 29 so we abod in the valley over against bethpeor 

4 1 now therefor hearken o israel unto the statut and unto the 
judgment which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go 
in and po the land which the lord god of your father giveth you 

4 2 ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall

lord your god which i command you 

4 3 your eye have seen what the lord did becau of baalpeor for all 
the men that follow baalpeor the lord thi god hath destroy them 
from among you 

4 4 but ye that did cleav unto the lord your god are aliv everi one 
of you thi day 

4 5 behold i have taught you statut and judgment even a the lord 
my god command me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to 
po it 

4 6 keep therefor and do them for thi is your wisdom and your 
understand in the sight of the nation which shall hear all these 
statut and say sure thi great nation is a wise and 
understand peopl 

4 7 for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them 
a the lord our god is in all thing that we call upon him for 4 8 
and what nation is there so great that hath statut and judgment so 
righteou a all thi law which i set befor you thi day 4 9 onli 
take heed to thyself and keep thi soul dilig lest thou forget 
the thing which thine eye have seen and lest they depart from thi 
heart all the day of thi life but teach them thi son and thi son 
son 4 10 special the day that thou stoodest befor the lord thi 
god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the peopl 
togeth and i will make them hear my word that they may learn to 
fear me all the day that they shall live upon the earth and that 
they may teach their child 

4 11 and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain 
burn with fire unto the midst of heaven with dark cloud and 
thick dark 

4 12 and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye 
heard the voic of the word but saw no similitud onli ye heard a 
voic 

4 13 and he declar unto you hi coven which he command you to 
perform even ten command and he wrote them upon two tabl of 
stone 

4 14 and the lord command me at that time to teach you statut and 
judgment that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to 
po it 

4 15 take ye therefor good heed unto yourselv for ye saw no manner 
of similitud on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of 
the midst of the fire 4 16 lest ye corrupt yourselv and make you a 
graven imag the similitud of ani figur the like of male or 
femal 4 17 the like of ani beast that is on the earth the 
like of ani wing fowl that flieth in the air 4 18 the like 
of ani thing that creepeth on the ground the like of ani fish 
that is in the water beneath the earth 4 19 and lest thou lift up 
thine eye unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and 
the star even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship 
them and serv them which the lord thi god hath divid unto all 
nation under the whole heaven 

4 20 but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the 
iron furnac even out of egypt to be unto him a peopl of 
inherit a ye are thi day 

4 21 furthermor the lord wa angri with me for your sake and sware 
that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto 
that good land which the lord thi god giveth thee for an inherit 
4 22 but i must die in thi land i must not go over jordan but ye 
shall go over and po that good land 

4 23 take heed unto yourselv lest ye forget the coven of the 
lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven imag or 
the like of ani thing which the lord thi god hath forbidden thee 

4 24 for the lord thi god is a consum fire even a jealou god 

4 25 when thou shalt beget child and child s child and ye 
shall have remain long in the land and shall corrupt yourselv 
and make a graven imag or the like of ani thing and shall do 
evil in the sight of the lord thi god to provok him to anger 4 26 i 
call heaven and earth to wit against you thi day that ye shall 
soon utterli perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to 
po it ye shall not prolong your day upon it but shall utterli 
be destroy 

4 27 and the lord shall scatter you among the nation and ye shall be 
left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you 

4 28 and there ye shall serv god the work of men s hand wood and 
stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell 

4 29 but if from thenc thou shalt seek the lord thi god thou shalt 
find him if thou seek him with all thi heart and with all thi soul 

4 30 when thou art in tribul and all these thing are come upon 
thee even in the latter day if thou turn to the lord thi god and 
shalt be obedi unto hi voic 4 31 for the lord thi god is a 
merci god he will not forsak thee neither destroy thee nor 
forget the coven of thi father which he sware unto them 

4 32 for ask now of the day that are past which were befor thee 
sinc the day that god creat man upon the earth and ask from the 
one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been ani such 
thing a thi great thing is or hath been heard like it 4 33 did 
ever peopl hear the voic of god speak out of the midst of the 
fire a thou hast heard and live 4 34 or hath god assay to go 
and take him a nation from the midst of anoth nation by 
temptat by sign and by wonder and by war and by a mighti 
hand and by a stretch out arm and by great terror accord to 
all that the lord your god did for you in egypt befor your eye 
4 35 unto thee it wa shew that thou mightest know that the lord he 
is god there is none el besid him 

4 36 out of heaven he made thee to hear hi voic that he might 
instruct thee and upon earth he shew thee hi great fire and thou 
heardest hi word out of the midst of the fire 

4 37 and becau he love thi father therefor he chose their seed 
after them and brought thee out in hi sight with hi mighti power 
out of egypt 4 38 to drive out nation from befor thee greater and 
mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for 
an inherit a it is thi day 

4 39 know therefor thi day and consid it in thine heart that the 
lord he is god in heaven abov and upon the earth beneath there is 
none el 

4 40 thou shalt keep therefor hi statut and hi command 
which i command thee thi day that it may go well with thee and with 
thi child after thee and that thou mayest prolong thi day upon 
the earth which the lord thi god giveth thee for ever 

4 41 then mose sever three citi on thi side jordan toward the 
sunri 4 42 that the slayer might flee thither which should kill 
hi neighbour unawar and hate him not in time past and that 
flee unto one of these citi he might live 4 43 name bezer in 
the wilder in the plain countri of the reubenit and ramoth in 
gilead of the gadit and golan in bashan of the manassit 

4 44 and thi is the law which mose set befor the child of 
israel 4 45 these are the testimoni and the statut and the 
judgment which mose spake unto the child of israel after they 
came forth out of egypt 

4 46 on thi side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the

9 26 i pray therefor unto the lord and said o lord god destroy 
not thi peopl and thine inherit which thou hast redeem through

mighti hand 

9 27 rememb thi servant abraham isaac and jacob look not unto

sin 9 28 lest the land whenc thou broughtest u out say becau the 
lord wa not abl to bring them into the land which he promi them 
and becau he hate them he hath brought them out to slay them in 
the wilder 

9 29 yet they are thi peopl and thine inherit which thou 
broughtest out by thi mighti power and by thi stretch out arm 

10 1 at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tabl of stone 
like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee

also and the lord would not destroy thee 

10 11 and the lord said unto me ari take thi journey befor the

10 12 and now israel what doth the lord thi god requir of thee but

which i command thee thi day for thi good 10 14 behold the heaven 
and the heaven of heaven is the lord s thi god the earth also with

widow and loveth the stranger in give him food and raiment 

10 19 love ye therefor the stranger for ye were stranger in the 
land of egypt 

10 20 thou shalt fear the lord thi god him shalt thou serv and to 
him shalt thou cleav and swear by hi name 

10 21 he is thi prai and he is thi god that hath done for thee 
these great and terribl thing which thine eye have seen 

10 22 thi father went down into egypt with threescor and ten 
person and now the lord thi god hath made thee a the star of 
heaven for multitud 

11 1 therefor thou shalt love the lord thi god and keep hi charg 
and hi statut and hi judgment and hi command alway 

11 2 and know ye thi day for i speak not with your child which 
have not known and which have not seen the chasti of the lord 
your god hi great hi mighti hand and hi stretch out arm 
11 3 and hi miracl and hi act which he did in the midst of 
egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all hi land 11 4 and 
what he did unto the armi of egypt unto their hor and to their 
chariot how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them a 
they pursu after you and how the lord hath destroy them unto thi 
day 11 5 and what he did unto you in the wilder until ye came 
into thi place 11 6 and what he did unto dathan and abiram the son 
of eliab the son of reuben how the earth open her mouth and 
swallow them up and their household and their tent and all the 
substanc that wa in their poss in the midst of all israel 
11 7 but your eye have seen all the great act of the lord which he 
did 

11 8 therefor shall ye keep all the command which i command you

whither ye go to po it 11 9 and that ye may prolong your day in 
the land which the lord sware unto your father to give unto them and 
to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey 

11 10 for the land whither thou goest in to po it is not a the 
land of egypt from whenc ye came out where thou sowedst thi seed 
and wateredst it with thi foot a a garden of herb 11 11 but the 
land whither ye go to po it is a land of hill and valley and 
drinketh water of the rain of heaven 11 12 a land which the lord thi 
god careth for the eye of the lord thi god are alway upon it from 
the begin of the year even unto the end of the year 

11 13 and it shall come to pa if ye shall hearken dilig unto 
my command which i command you thi day to love the lord your 
god and to serv him with all your heart and with all your soul 
11 14 that i will give you the rain of your land in hi due season 
the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thi 
corn and thi wine and thine oil 

11 15 and i will send grass in thi field for thi cattl that thou 
mayest eat and be full 

11 16 take heed to yourselv that your heart be not deceiv and ye 
turn asid and serv other god and worship them 11 17 and then the 
lord s wrath be kindl against you and he shut up the heaven that 
there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye 
perish quickli from off the good land which the lord giveth you 

11 18 therefor shall ye lay up these my word in your heart and in 
your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be 
a frontlet between your eye 

11 19 and ye shall teach them your child speak of them when 
thou sittest in thine hou and when thou walkest by the way when 
thou liest down and when thou risest up 

11 20 and thou shalt write them upon the door post of thine hou 
and upon thi gate 11 21 that your day may be multipli and the 
day of your child in the land which the lord sware unto your 
father to give them a the day of heaven upon the earth 

11 22 for if ye shall dilig keep all these command which i 
command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all hi 
way and to cleav unto him 11 23 then will the lord drive out all 
these nation from befor you and ye shall po greater nation 
and mightier than yourselv 

11 24 everi place whereon the sol of your foot shall tread shall be 
your from the wilder and lebanon from the river the river 
euphrat even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be 

11 25 there shall no man be abl to stand befor you for the lord 
your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the 
land that ye shall tread upon a he hath said unto you 

11 26 behold i set befor you thi day a bless and a cur 11 27 
a bless if ye obey the command of the lord your god which i 
command you thi day 11 28 and a cur if ye will not obey the 
command of the lord your god but turn asid out of the way which 
i command you thi day to go after other god which ye have not 
known 

11 29 and it shall come to pa when the lord thi god hath brought 
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to po it that thou 
shalt put the bless upon mount gerizim and the cur upon mount 
ebal 

11 30 are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun 
goeth down in the land of the canaanit which dwell in the 
champaign over against gilgal besid the plain of moreh 11 31 for 
ye shall pa over jordan to go in to po the land which the lord 
your god giveth you and ye shall po it and dwell therein 

11 32 and ye shall observ to do all the statut and judgment which 
i set befor you thi day

and that the whole land thereof is brimston and salt and burn 
that it is not sown nor beareth nor ani grass groweth therein like

32 13 he made him ride on the high place of the earth that he might 
eat the increa of the field and he made him to suck honey out of 
the rock and oil out of the flinti rock 32 14 butter of kine and 
milk of sheep with fat of lamb and ram of the breed of bashan and 
goat with the fat of kidney of wheat and thou didst drink the pure 
blood of the grape 

32 15 but jeshurun wax fat and kick thou art waxen fat thou art 
grown thick thou art cover with fat then he forsook god which 
made him and lightli esteem the rock of hi salvat 

32 16 they provok him to jealousi with strang god with 
abomin provok they him to anger 

32 17 they sacrif unto devil not to god to god whom they knew 
not to new god that came newli up whom your father fear not 

32 18 of the rock that begat thee thou art unmind and hast 
forgotten god that form thee 

32 19 and when the lord saw it he abhor them becau of the 
provok of hi son and of hi daughter 

32 20 and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what 
their end shall be for they are a veri froward gener child 
in whom is no faith 

32 21 they have move me to jealousi with that which is not god they 
have provok me to anger with their vaniti and i will move them to 
jealousi with those which are not a peopl i will provok them to 
anger with a foolish nation 

32 22 for a fire is kindl in mine anger and shall burn unto the 
lowest hell and shall consum the earth with her increa and set on 
fire the foundat of the mountain 

32 23 i will heap mischief upon them i will spend mine arrow upon 
them 

32 24 they shall be burnt with hunger and devour with burn heat 
and with bitter destruct i will also send the teeth of beast upon 
them with the poison of serpent of the dust 

32 25 the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the 
young man and the virgin the suckl also with the man of gray 
hair 

32 26 i said i would scatter them into corner i would make the 
remembr of them to cea from among men 32 27 were it not that i 
fear the wrath of the enemi lest their adversari should behav 
themselv strang and lest they should say our hand is high and 
the lord hath not done all thi 

32 28 for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there ani 
understand in them 

32 29 o that they were wise that they understood thi that they 
would consid their latter end 32 30 how should one chase a 
thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had 
sold them and the lord had shut them up 32 31 for their rock is not 
a our rock even our enemi themselv be judg 

32 32 for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the field of 
gomorrah their grape are grape of gall their cluster are bitter 
32 33 their wine is the poison of dragon and the cruel venom of 
asp 

32 34 is not thi laid up in store with me and seal up among my 
treasur 32 35 to me belongeth vengeanc and recomp their foot 
shall slide in due time for the day of their calam is at hand and 
the thing that shall come upon them make hast 

32 36 for the lord shall judg hi peopl and repent himself for hi 
servant when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none 
shut up or left 

32 37 and he shall say where are their god their rock in whom they 
trust 32 38 which did eat the fat of their sacrif and drank 
the wine of their drink offer let them rise up and help you and 
be your protect 

32 39 see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i 
kill and i make aliv i wound and i heal neither is there ani that 
can deliv out of my hand 

32 40 for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever 

32 41 if i whet my glitter sword and mine hand take hold on 
judgment i will render vengeanc to mine enemi and will reward 
them that hate me 

32 42 i will make mine arrow drunk with blood and my sword shall 
devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the 
captiv from the begin of reveng upon the enemi 

32 43 rejoic o ye nation with hi peopl for he will aveng the 
blood of hi servant and will render vengeanc to hi adversari 
and will be merci unto hi land and to hi peopl 

32 44 and mose came and spake all the word of thi song in the ear

7 3 and they return to joshua and said unto him let not all the

thi great name 7 10 and the lord said unto joshua get thee up 
wherefor liest thou thu upon thi face 7 11 israel hath sin and 
they have also transgress my coven which i command them for 
they have even taken of the accur thing and have also stolen and 
dissembl also and they have put it even among their own stuff 

7 12 therefor the child of israel could not stand befor their 
enemi but turn their back befor their enemi becau they 
were accur neither will i be with you ani more except ye destroy 
the accur from among you 

7 13 up sanctifi the peopl and say sanctifi yourselv against to

24 16 and the peopl answer and said god forbid that we should 
forsak the lord to serv other god 24 17 for the lord our god he 
it is that brought u up and our father out of the land of egypt 
from the hou of bondag and which did those great sign in our

therefor will we also serv the lord for he is our god 

24 19 and joshua said unto the peopl ye cannot serv the lord for 
he is an holi god he is a jealou god he will not forgiv your 
transgress nor your sin 

24 20 if ye forsak the lord and serv strang god then he will 
turn and do you hurt and consum you after that he hath done you 
good 

24 21 and the peopl said unto joshua nay but we will serv the 
lord 

24 22 and joshua said unto the peopl ye are wit against 
yourselv that ye have chosen you the lord to serv him and they 
said we are wit

among you and inclin your heart unto the lord god of israel 

24 24 and the peopl said unto joshua the lord our god will we serv 
and hi voic will we obey 

24 25 so joshua made a coven with the peopl that day and set them 
a statut and an ordin in shechem 

24 26 and joshua wrote these word in the book of the law of god and 
took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that wa by the

which brought them out of the land of egypt and follow other god 
of the god of the peopl that were round about them and bow

length and he did gird it under hi raiment upon hi right thigh 

3 17 and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon wa

right thigh and thrust it into hi belli 3 22 and the haft also went 
in after the blade and the fat close upon the blade so that he 
could not draw the dagger out of hi belli and the dirt came out

3 29 and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all 
lusti and all men of valour and there escap not a man 

3 30 so moab wa subdu that day under the hand of israel and the 
land had rest fourscor year 

3 31 and after him wa shamgar the son of anath which slew of the 
philistin six hundr men with an ox goad and he also deliv

went with barak to kedesh 

4 10 and barak call zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up

edg of the sword and there wa not a man left 

4 17 howbeit sisera fled away on hi foot to the tent of jael the wife 
of heber the kenit for there wa peac between jabin the king of

4 18 and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my 
lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turn in unto her into

4 20 again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it

israel the elder of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of 
tob 11 6 and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that 
we may fight with the child of ammon 

11 7 and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead did not ye hate me 
and expel me out of my father s hou and whi are ye come unto me now 
when ye are in distress 11 8 and the elder of gilead said unto 
jephthah therefor we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go 
with u and fight against the child of ammon and be our head over 
all the inhabit of gilead 

11 9 and jephthah said unto the elder of gilead if ye bring me home 
again to fight against the child of ammon and the lord deliv 
them befor me shall i be your head 11 10 and the elder of gilead 
said unto jephthah the lord be wit between u if we do not so 
accord to thi word 

11 11 then jephthah went with the elder of gilead and the peopl 
made him head and captain over them and jephthah utter all hi 
word befor the lord in mizpeh 

11 12 and jephthah sent messeng unto the king of the child of 
ammon say what hast thou to do with me that thou art come 
against me to fight in my land 11 13 and the king of the child of 
ammon answer unto the messeng of jephthah becau israel took 
away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto 
jabbok and unto jordan now therefor restor those land again 
peaceabl 

11 14 and jephthah sent messeng again unto the king of the child 
of ammon 11 15 and said unto him thu saith jephthah israel took 
not away the land of moab nor the land of the child of ammon 
11 16 but when israel came up from egypt and walk through the 
wilder unto the red sea and came to kadesh 11 17 then israel 
sent messeng unto the king of edom say let me i pray thee 
pa through thi land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto 
and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not 
consent and israel abod in kadesh 

11 18 then they went along through the wilder and compass the 
land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the 
land of moab and pitch on the other side of arnon but came not 
within the border of moab for arnon wa the border of moab 

11 19 and israel sent messeng unto sihon king of the amorit the 
king of heshbon and israel said unto him let u pa we pray thee 
through thi land into my place 

11 20 but sihon trust not israel to pa through hi coast but 
sihon gather all hi peopl togeth and pitch in jahaz and 
fought against israel 

11 21 and the lord god of israel deliv sihon and all hi peopl 
into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel poss all 
the land of the amorit the inhabit of that countri 

11 22 and they poss all the coast of the amorit from arnon 
even unto jabbok and from the wilder even unto jordan 

11 23 so now the lord god of israel hath dispossess the amorit 
from befor hi peopl israel and shouldest thou po it 11 24 
wilt not thou po that which chemosh thi god giveth thee to 
po so whomsoev the lord our god shall drive out from befor 
u them will we po 

11 25 and now art thou ani thing better than balak the son of zippor 
king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight 
against them 11 26 while israel dwelt in heshbon and her town and 
in aroer and her town and in all the citi that be along by the 
coast of arnon three hundr year whi therefor did ye not recov 
them within that time 11 27 wherefor i have not sin against 
thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judg be 
judg thi day between the child of israel and the child of 
ammon 

11 28 howbeit the king of the child of ammon hearken not unto the 
word of jephthah which he sent him 

11 29 then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he pa 
over gilead and manasseh and pa over mizpeh of gilead and from 
mizpeh of gilead he pa over unto the child of ammon 

11 30 and jephthah vow a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt 
without fail deliv the child of ammon into mine hand 11 31 then 
it shall be that whatsoev cometh forth of the door of my hou to 
meet me when i return in peac from the child of ammon shall 
sure be the lord s and i will offer it up for a burnt offer 

11 32 so jephthah pa over unto the child of ammon to fight 
against them and the lord deliv them into hi hand 

11 33 and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith 
even twenti citi and unto the plain of the vineyard with a veri

art one of them that troubl me for i have open my mouth unto the 
lord and i cannot go back 

11 36 and she said unto him my father if thou hast open thi mouth 
unto the lord do to me accord to that which hath proceed out of 
thi mouth forasmuch a the lord hath taken vengeanc for thee of 
thine enemi even of the child of ammon 

11 37 and she said unto her father let thi thing be done for me let

bewail my virgin i and my fellow 

11 38 and he said go and he sent her away for two month and she

mountain 

11 39 and it came to pa at the end of two month that she return

12 1 and the men of ephraim gather themselv togeth and went 
northward and said unto jephthah wherefor passedst thou over to 
fight against the child of ammon and didst not call u to go with 
thee we will burn thine hou upon thee with fire 

12 2 and jephthah said unto them i and my peopl were at great strife 
with the child of ammon and when i call you ye deliv me not 
out of their hand 

12 3 and when i saw that ye deliv me not i put my life in my 
hand and pa over against the child of ammon and the lord 
deliv them into my hand wherefor then are ye come up unto me 
thi day to fight against me 12 4 then jephthah gather togeth

ephraimit and it wa so that when those ephraimit which were 
escap said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him 
art thou an ephraimit if he said nay 12 6 then said they unto him

13 17 and the spoiler came out of the camp of the philistin in

ophrah unto the land of shual 13 18 and anoth compani turn the 
way to bethhoron and anoth compani turn to the way of the border 
that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilder 

13 19 now there wa no smith found throughout all the land of israel 
for the philistin said lest the hebrew make them sword or spear 
13 20 but all the israelit went down to the philistin to sharpen 
everi man hi share and hi coulter and hi axe and hi mattock 

13 21 yet they had a file for the mattock and for the coulter and 
for the fork and for the ax and to sharpen the goad 

13 22 so it came to pa in the day of battl that there wa neither 
sword nor spear found in the hand of ani of the peopl that were with 
saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan hi son wa there 
found 

13 23 and the garrison of the philistin went out to the passag of 
michmash 

14 1 now it came to pa upon a day that jonathan the son of saul 
said unto the young man that bare hi armour come and let u go over 
to the philistin garrison that is on the other side but he told

14 2 and saul tarri in the uttermost part of gibeah under a

side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one wa 
bozez and the name of the other seneh 

14 5 the forefront of the one wa situat northward over against 
michmash and the other southward over against gibeah 

14 6 and jonathan said to the young man that bare hi armour come 
and let u go over unto the garrison of these uncircumci it may be 
that the lord will work for u for there is no restraint to the lord 
to save by mani or by few 

14 7 and hi armourbear said unto him do all that is in thine 
heart turn thee behold i am with thee accord to thi heart 

14 8 then said jonathan behold we will pa over unto these men and 
we will discov ourselv unto them 

14 9 if they say thu unto u tarri until we come to you then we 
will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them 

14 10 but if they say thu come up unto u then we will go up for 
the lord hath deliv them into our hand and thi shall be a sign 
unto u 

14 11 and both of them discov themselv unto the garrison of the 
philistin and the philistin said behold the hebrew come forth 
out of the hole where they had hid themselv 

14 12 and the men of the garrison answer jonathan and hi 
armourbear and said come up to u and we will shew you a thing 
and jonathan said unto hi armourbear come up after me for the 
lord hath deliv them into the hand of israel 

14 13 and jonathan climb up upon hi hand and upon hi foot and 
hi armourbear after him and they fell befor jonathan and hi 
armourbear slew after him 

14 14 and that first slaughter which jonathan and hi armourbear 
made wa about twenti men within a it were an half acr of land 
which a yoke of ox might plow 

14 15 and there wa trembl in the host in the field and among all 
the peopl the garrison and the spoiler they also trembl and 
the earth quak so it wa a veri great trembl 

14 16 and the watchman of saul in gibeah of benjamin look and 
behold the multitud melt away and they went on beat down one 
anoth 

14 17 then said saul unto the peopl that were with him number now 
and see who is gone from u and when they had number behold 
jonathan and hi armourbear were not there 

14 18 and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the 
ark of god wa at that time with the child of israel 

14 19 and it came to pa while saul talk unto the priest that the 
noi that wa in the host of the philistin went on and increa 
and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand 

14 20 and saul and all the peopl that were with him assembl

sword wa against hi fellow and there wa a veri great discomfitur 

14 21 moreov the hebrew that were with the philistin befor that 
time which went up with them into the camp from the countri round 
about even they also turn to be with the israelit that were with 
saul and jonathan 

14 22 likewi all the men of israel which had hid themselv in mount 
ephraim when they heard that the philistin fled even they also 
follow hard after them in the battl 

14 23 so the lord save israel that day and the battl pa over

14 24 and the men of israel were distress that day for saul had 
adjur the peopl say cur be the man that eateth ani food 
until even that i may be aveng on mine enemi so none of the 
peopl tast ani food 

14 25 and all they of the land came to a wood and there wa honey 
upon the ground 

14 26 and when the peopl were come into the wood behold the honey 
drop but no man put hi hand to hi mouth for the peopl fear 
the oath 

14 27 but jonathan heard not when hi father charg the peopl with 
the oath wherefor he put forth the end of the rod that wa in hi 
hand and dip it in an honeycomb and put hi hand to hi mouth 
and hi eye were enlighten 

14 28 then answer one of the peopl and said thi father straitli 
charg the peopl with an oath say cur be the man that eateth 
ani food thi day and the peopl were faint 

14 29 then said jonathan my father hath troubl the land see i 
pray you how mine eye have been enlighten becau i tast a 
littl of thi honey 

14 30 how much more if hapli the peopl had eaten freeli to day of 
the spoil of their enemi which they found for had there not been 
now a much greater slaughter among the philistin 14 31 and they 
smote the philistin that day from michmash to aijalon and the 
peopl were veri faint 

14 32 and the peopl flew upon the spoil and took sheep and ox 
and calf and slew them on the ground and the peopl did eat them 
with the blood 

14 33 then they told saul say behold the peopl sin against the 
lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have 
transgress roll a great stone unto me thi day 

14 34 and saul said disper yourselv among the peopl and say 
unto them bring me hither everi man hi ox and everi man hi sheep 
and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eat 
with the blood 

and all the peopl brought everi man hi ox with him that night and 
slew them there 

14 35 and saul built an altar unto the lord the same wa the first 
altar that he built unto the lord 

14 36 and saul said let u go down after the philistin by night 
and spoil them until the morn light and let u not leav a man of 
them and they said do whatsoev seemeth good unto thee then said 
the priest let u draw near hither unto god 

14 37 and saul ask counsel of god shall i go down after the 
philistin wilt thou deliv them into the hand of israel but he 
answer him not that day 

14 38 and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the peopl 
and know and see wherein thi sin hath been thi day 

14 39 for a the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in 
jonathan my son he shall sure die but there wa not a man among 
all the peopl that answer him 

14 40 then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and 
jonathan my son will be on the other side and the peopl said unto 
saul do what seemeth good unto thee 

14 41 therefor saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect 
lot 

and saul and jonathan were taken but the peopl escap 

14 42 and saul said cast lot between me and jonathan my son and 
jonathan wa taken 

14 43 then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and 
jonathan told him and said i did but tast a littl honey with the 
end of the rod that wa in mine hand and lo i must die 

14 44 and saul answer god do so and more also for thou shalt 
sure die jonathan 

14 45 and the peopl said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath 
wrought thi great salvat in israel god forbid a the lord 
liveth there shall not one hair of hi head fall to the ground for 
he hath wrought with god thi day so the peopl rescu jonathan 
that he die not 

14 46 then saul went up from follow the philistin and the 
philistin went to their own place 

14 47 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all hi 
enemi on everi side against moab and against the child of 
ammon and against edom and against the king of zobah and against 
the philistin and whithersoev he turn himself he vex them 

14 48 and he gather an host and smote the amalekit and deliv 
israel out of the hand of them that spoil them 

14 49 now the son of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua 
and the name of hi two daughter were these the name of the

of the captain of hi host wa abner the son of ner saul s uncl 

14 51 and kish wa the father of saul and ner the father of abner wa 
the son of abiel 

14 52 and there wa sore war against the philistin all the day of 
saul and when saul saw ani strong man or ani valiant man he took 
him unto him 

15 1 samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be 
king over hi peopl over israel now therefor hearken thou unto the 
voic of the word of the lord 

15 2 thu saith the lord of host i rememb that which amalek did to

15 3 now go and smite amalek and utterli destroy all that they have 
and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckl 
ox and sheep camel and a 

15 4 and saul gather the peopl togeth and number them in 
telaim two hundr thousand footman and ten thousand men of judah 

15 5 and saul came to a citi of amalek and laid wait in the valley 

15 6 and saul said unto the kenit go depart get you down from 
among the amalekit lest i destroy you with them for ye shew 
kind to all the child of israel when they came up out of 
egypt so the kenit depart from among the amalekit 

15 7 and saul smote the amalekit from havilah until thou comest to 
shur that is over against egypt 

15 8 and he took agag the king of the amalekit aliv and utterli 
destroy all the peopl with the edg of the sword 

15 9 but saul and the peopl spare agag and the best of the sheep 
and of the ox and of the fatl and the lamb and all that wa 
good and would not utterli destroy them but everi thing that wa 
vile and refu that they destroy utterli 

15 10 then came the word of the lord unto samuel say 15 11 it 
repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turn back

15 13 and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him bless be thou

15 14 and samuel said what meaneth then thi bleat of the sheep in 
mine ear and the low of the ox which i hear 15 15 and saul 
said they have brought them from the amalekit for the peopl 
spare the best of the sheep and of the ox to sacrif unto the 
lord thi god and the rest we have utterli destroy 

15 16 then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the 
lord hath said to me thi night and he said unto him say on

said go and utterli destroy the sinner the amalekit and fight 
against them until they be consum 

15 19 wherefor then didst thou not obey the voic of the lord but 
didst fli upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord 
15 20 and saul said unto samuel yea i have obey the voic of the 
lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought

15 21 but the peopl took of the spoil sheep and ox the chief of 
the thing which should have been utterli destroy to sacrif unto

15 22 and samuel said hath the lord a great delight in burnt 
offer and sacrif a in obey the voic of the lord behold 
to obey is better than sacrif and to hearken than the fat of ram 

15 23 for rebellion is a the sin of witchcraft and stubborn is 
a iniqu and idolatri becau thou hast reject the word of the 
lord he hath also reject thee from be king 

15 24 and saul said unto samuel i have sin for i have 
transgress the command of the lord and thi word becau i 
fear the peopl and obey their voic 

15 25 now therefor i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with 
me that i may worship the lord 

15 26 and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou 
hast reject the word of the lord and the lord hath reject thee 
from be king over israel 

15 27 and a samuel turn about to go away he laid hold upon the 
skirt of hi mantl and it rent 

15 28 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of 
israel from thee thi day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine 
that is better than thou 

15 29 and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he 
is not a man that he should repent 

15 30 then he said i have sin yet honour me now i pray thee 
befor the elder of my peopl and befor israel and turn again with 
me that i may worship the lord thi god 

15 31 so samuel turn again after saul and saul worship the lord 

15 32 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the 
amalekit and agag came unto him delic and agag said sure 
the bitter of death is past 

15 33 and samuel said a the sword hath made woman childless so 
shall thi mother be childless among woman and samuel hew agag in 
piec befor the lord in gilgal 

15 34 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to hi hou to

15 35 and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of hi death 
nevertheless samuel mourn for saul and the lord repent that he

thou peaceabl 16 5 and he said peaceabl i am come to sacrif 
unto the lord sanctifi yourselv and come with me to the sacrif

thi servant will go and fight with thi philistin 

17 33 and saul said to david thou art not abl to go against thi 
philistin to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man

had even in a scrip and hi sling wa in hi hand and he drew near 
to the philistin 

17 41 and the philistin came on and drew near unto david and the man 
that bare the shield went befor him

sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the 
name of the lord of host the god of the armi of israel whom thou 
hast defi 

17 46 thi day will the lord deliv thee into mine hand and i will 
smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the 
carca of the host of the philistin thi day unto the fowl of the 
air and to the wild beast of the earth that all the earth may know 
that there is a god in israel 

17 47 and all thi assembl shall know that the lord saveth not with

wa dead they fled 

17 52 and the men of israel and of judah aro and shout and

brought thi servant into a coven of the lord with thee 
notwithstand if there be in me iniqu slay me thyself for whi 
shouldest thou bring me to thi father 20 9 and jonathan said far be

father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee 20 10 then 
said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thi father 
answer thee roughli 20 11 and jonathan said unto david come and 
let u go out into the field and they went out both of them into the

send thee away that thou mayest go in peac and the lord be with 
thee a he hath been with my father 

20 14 and thou shalt not onli while yet i live shew me the kind of 
the lord that i die not 20 15 but also thou shalt not cut off thi 
kind from my hou for ever no not when the lord hath cut off 
the enemi of david everi one from the face of the earth 

20 16 so jonathan made a coven with the hou of david say let 
the lord even requir it at the hand of david s enemi 

20 17 and jonathan cau david to swear again becau he love him 
for he love him a he love hi own soul 

20 18 then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou 
shalt be miss becau thi seat will be empti 

20 19 and when thou hast stay three day then thou shalt go down 
quickli and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the 
busi wa in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel

beyond thee go thi way for the lord hath sent thee away 

20 23 and a touch the matter which thou and i have spoken of

seat by the wall and jonathan aro and abner sat by saul s side

24 20 and now behold i know well that thou shalt sure be king and 
that the kingdom of israel shall be establish in thine hand 

24 21 swear now therefor unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut

24 22 and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and hi 
men gat them up unto the hold 

25 1 and samuel die and all the israelit were gather togeth 
and lament him and buri him in hi hou at ramah and david 
aro and went down to the wilder of paran 

25 2 and there wa a man in maon whose poss were in carmel 
and the man wa veri great and he had three thousand sheep and a 
thousand goat and he wa shear hi sheep in carmel 

25 3 now the name of the man wa nabal and the name of hi wife 
abigail and she wa a woman of good understand and of a beauti 
counten but the man wa churlish and evil in hi do and he 
wa of the hou of caleb 

25 4 and david heard in the wilder that nabal did shear hi sheep 

25 5 and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young 
men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name 
25 6 and thu shall ye say to him that liveth in prosper peac be 
both to thee and peac be to thine hou and peac be unto all that 
thou hast 

25 7 and now i have heard that thou hast shearer now thi shepherd

25 8 ask thi young men and they will shew thee wherefor let the 
young men find favour in thine eye for we come in a good day give 
i pray thee whatsoev cometh to thine hand unto thi servant and to 
thi son david 

25 9 and when david s young men came they spake to nabal accord to 
all those word in the name of david and cea 

25 10 and nabal answer david s servant and said who is david and 
who is the son of jess there be mani servant now a day that break 
away everi man from hi master 

25 11 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i

again and came and told him all those say 

25 13 and david said unto hi men gird ye on everi man hi sword and 
they gird on everi man hi sword and david also gird on hi

hundr abod by the stuff 

25 14 but one of the young men told abigail nabal s wife say

25 15 but the men were veri good unto u and we were not hurt 
neither miss we ani thing a long a we were conver with them 
when we were in the field 25 16 they were a wall unto u both by 
night and day all the while we were with them keep the sheep 

25 17 now therefor know and consid what thou wilt do for evil is 
determin against our master and against all hi household for he 
is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him 

25 18 then abigail made hast and took two hundr loaf and two 
bottl of wine and five sheep readi dress and five measur of 
parch corn and an hundr cluster of raisin and two hundr 
cake of fig and laid them on as 

25 19 and she said unto her servant go on befor me behold i come

25 20 and it wa so a she rode on the a that she came down by the 
covert on the hill and behold david and hi men came down against 
her and she met them 

25 21 now david had said sure in vain have i kept all that thi 
fellow hath in the wilder so that noth wa miss of all that 
pertain unto him and he hath requit me evil for good 

25 22 so and more also do god unto the enemi of david if i leav of

the wall 

25 23 and when abigail saw david she hast and light off the a 
and fell befor david on her face and bow herself to the ground 
25 24 and fell at hi foot and said upon me my lord upon me let 
thi iniqu be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine 
audienc and hear the word of thine handmaid 

25 25 let not my lord i pray thee regard thi man of belial even 
nabal for a hi name is so is he nabal is hi name and folli is 
with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom 
thou didst send 

25 26 now therefor my lord a the lord liveth and a thi soul 
liveth see the lord hath withholden thee from come to shed 
blood and from aveng thyself with thine own hand now let thine 
enemi and they that seek evil to my lord be a nabal 

25 27 and now thi bless which thine handmaid hath brought unto my 
lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord 

25 28 i pray thee forgiv the trespass of thine handmaid for the 
lord will certainli make my lord a sure hou becau my lord 
fighteth the battl of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee 
all thi day 

25 29 yet a man is risen to pursu thee and to seek thi soul but the 
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundl of life with the lord thi 
god and the soul of thine enemi them shall he sling out a out 
of the middl of a sling 

25 30 and it shall come to pa when the lord shall have done to my 
lord accord to all the good that he hath spoken concern thee 
and shall have appoint thee ruler over israel 25 31 that thi shall 
be no grief unto thee nor offenc of heart unto my lord either that 
thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath aveng himself 
but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then rememb 
thine handmaid 

25 32 and david said to abigail bless be the lord god of israel 
which sent thee thi day to meet me 25 33 and bless be thi advic 
and bless be thou which hast kept me thi day from come to shed 
blood and from aveng myself with mine own hand 

25 34 for in veri deed a the lord god of israel liveth which hath 
kept me back from hurt thee except thou hadst hast and come to 
meet me sure there had not been left unto nabal by the morn 
light ani that pisseth against the wall 

25 35 so david receiv of her hand that which she had brought him 
and said unto her go up in peac to thine hou see i have 
hearken to thi voic and have accept thi person 

25 36 and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in hi 
hou like the feast of a king and nabal s heart wa merri within

25 38 and it came to pa about ten day after that the lord smote

25 39 and when david heard that nabal wa dead he said bless be 
the lord that hath plead the cau of my reproach from the hand of 
nabal and hath kept hi servant from evil for the lord hath return 
the wick of nabal upon hi own head and david sent and commun 
with abigail to take her to him to wife 

25 40 and when the servant of david were come to abigail to carmel 
they spake unto her say david sent u unto thee to take thee to 
him to wife 

25 41 and she aro and bow herself on her face to the earth and 
said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the foot of the

25 42 and abigail hast and aro and rode upon an a with five

25 43 david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of

25 44 but saul had given michal hi daughter david s wife to phalti 
the son of laish which wa of gallim 

26 1 and the ziphit came unto saul to gibeah say doth not david 
hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is befor jeshimon 26 2 
then saul aro and went down to the wilder of ziph have three 
thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the

26 3 and saul pitch in the hill of hachilah which is befor 
jeshimon by the way but david abod in the wilder and he saw

26 4 david therefor sent out spi and understood that saul wa come

26 5 and david aro and came to the place where saul had pitch 
and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner 
the captain of hi host and saul lay in the trench and the peopl

26 6 then answer david and said to ahimelech the hittit and to 
abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab say who will go down 
with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with 
thee 

26 7 so david and abishai came to the peopl by night and behold 
saul lay sleep within the trench and hi spear stuck in the ground 
at hi bolster but abner and the peopl lay round about him 

26 8 then said abishai to david god hath deliv thine enemi into 
thine hand thi day now therefor let me smite him i pray thee with 
the spear even to the earth at onc and i will not smite him the 
second time 

26 9 and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch 
forth hi hand against the lord s anoint and be guiltless 26 10 
david said furthermor a the lord liveth the lord shall smite him 
or hi day shall come to die or he shall descend into battl and 
perish 

26 11 the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against 
the lord s anoint but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is 
at hi bolster and the cruse of water and let u go 

26 12 so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul s 
bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it 
neither awak for they were all asleep becau a deep sleep from 
the lord wa fallen upon them 

26 13 then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of

cri to the peopl and to abner the son of ner say answerest 
thou not abner then abner answer and said who art thou that

26 16 thi thing is not good that thou hast done a the lord liveth 
ye are worthi to die becau ye have not kept your master the lord s 
anoint 

and now see where the king s spear is and the cruse of water that wa

26 17 and saul knew david s voic and said is thi thi voic my son 
david and david said it is my voic my lord o king 

26 18 and he said wherefor doth my lord thu pursu after hi 
servant for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand 26 19

26 24 and behold a thi life wa much set by thi day in mine eye

deliv me out of all tribul 

26 25 then saul said to david bless be thou my son david thou 
shalt both do great thing and also shalt still prevail so david 
went on hi way and saul return to hi place 

27 1 and david said in hi heart i shall now perish one day by the 
hand of saul there is noth better for me than that i should 
speedili escap into the land of the philistin and saul shall 
despair of me to seek me ani more in ani coast of israel so shall i 
escap out of hi hand 

27 2 and david aro and he pa over with the six hundr men that

27 3 and david dwelt with achish at gath he and hi men everi man 
with hi household even david with hi two wife ahinoam the 
jezreelitess and abigail the carmelit nabal s wife 

27 4 and it wa told saul that david wa fled to gath and he sought

27 5 and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine 
eye let them give me a place in some town in the countri that i may 
dwell there for whi should thi servant dwell in the royal citi with 
thee 27 6 then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefor ziklag

28 1 and it came to pa in those day that the philistin gather 
their armi togeth for warfar to fight with israel and achish 
said unto david know thou assuredli that thou shalt go out with me 
to battl thou and thi men 

28 2 and david said to achish sure thou shalt know what thi servant

life to cau me to die 28 10 and saul sware to her by the lord 
say a the lord liveth there shall no punish happen to thee 
for thi thing

said bring me up samuel 

28 12 and when the woman saw samuel she cri with a loud voic and 
the woman spake to saul say whi hast thou deceiv me for thou

28 14 and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old 
man cometh up and he is cover with a mantl and saul perceiv

executedst hi fierc wrath upon amalek therefor hath the lord done 
thi thing unto thee thi day

hand of the philistin and to morrow shalt thou and thi son be with 
me the lord also shall deliv the host of israel into the hand of

28 20 then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and wa sore 
afraid becau of the word of samuel and there wa no strength in 
him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night 

28 21 and the woman came unto saul and saw that he wa sore troubl 
and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obey thi voic and i 
have put my life in my hand and have hearken unto thi word which 
thou spakest unto me 

28 22 now therefor i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voic of 
thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread befor thee and eat 
that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thi way 

28 23 but he refu and said i will not eat but hi servant 
togeth with the woman compel him and he hearken unto their 
voic so he aro from the earth and sat upon the bed 

28 24 and the woman had a fat calf in the hou and she hast and 
kill it and took flour and knead it and did bake unleaven 
bread thereof 28 25 and she brought it befor saul and befor hi 
servant and they did eat then they rose up and went away that 
night 

29 1 now the philistin gather togeth all their armi to aphek 
and the israelit pitch by a fountain which is in jezreel 

29 2 and the lord of the philistin pa on by hundr and by 
thousand but david and hi men pa on in the rereward with

with me these day or these year and i have found no fault in him 
sinc he fell unto me unto thi day 29 4 and the princ of the 
philistin were wroth with him and the princ of the philistin 
said unto him make thi fellow return that he may go again to hi 
place which thou hast appoint him and let him not go down with u 
to battl lest in the battl he be an adversari to u for wherewith 
should he reconcil himself unto hi master should it not be with the 
head of these men 29 5 is not thi david of whom they sang one to 
anoth in danc say saul slew hi thousand and david hi ten 
thousand 29 6 then achish call david and said unto him sure 
a the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thi go out and thi

29 8 and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast 
thou found in thi servant so long a i have been with thee unto thi 
day that i may not go fight against the enemi of my lord the king 
29 9 and achish answer and said to david i know that thou art good 
in my sight a an angel of god notwithstand the princ of the

29 10 wherefor now rise up earli in the morn with thi master s 
servant that are come with thee and a soon a ye be up earli in the 
morn and have light depart 

29 11 so david and hi men rose up earli to depart in the morn to 
return into the land of the philistin and the philistin went up 
to jezreel 

30 1 and it came to pa when david and hi men were come to ziklag

ephod to david 

30 8 and david enquir at the lord say shall i pursu after thi

30 10 but david pursu he and four hundr men for two hundr 
abod behind which were so faint that they could not go over the

water 30 12 and they gave him a piec of a cake of fig and two 
cluster of raisin and when he had eaten hi spirit came again to

and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor 
deliv me into the hand of my master and i will bring thee down to

30 16 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread 
abroad upon all the earth eat and drink and danc becau

30 21 and david came to the two hundr men which were so faint that 
they could not follow david whom they had made also to abid at the

30 22 then answer all the wick men and men of belial of those 
that went with david and said becau they went not with u we will 
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recov save to everi

1 10 so i stood upon him and slew him becau i wa sure that he 
could not live after that he wa fallen and i took the crown that wa

them hither unto my lord 

1 11 then david took hold on hi cloth and rent them and likewi

3 19 and abner also spake in the ear of benjamin and abner went also 
to speak in the ear of david in hebron all that seem good to 
israel and that seem good to the whole hou of benjamin 

3 20 so abner came to david to hebron and twenti men with him and 
david made abner and the men that were with him a feast 

3 21 and abner said unto david i will ari and go and will gather 
all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a leagu with

hou and let there not fail from the hou of joab one that hath an 
issu or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth

3 30 so joab and abishai hi brother slew abner becau he had slain

4 2 and saul s son had two men that were captain of band the name 
of the one wa baanah and the name of the other rechab the son of 
rimmon a beerothit of the child of benjamin for beeroth also

4 6 and they came thither into the midst of the hou a though they

bed shall i not therefor now requir hi blood of your hand and 
take you away from the earth 4 12 and david command hi young men 
and they slew them and cut off their hand and their foot and hang 
them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth 
and buri it in the sepulchr of abner in hebron 

5 1 then came all the tribe of israel to david unto hebron and 
spake say behold we are thi bone and thi flesh 

5 2 also in time past when saul wa king over u thou wast he that 
leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou 
shalt feed my peopl israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel 

5 3 so all the elder of israel came to the king to hebron and king 
david made a leagu with them in hebron befor the lord and they 
anoint david king over israel 

5 4 david wa thirti year old when he began to reign and he reign

5 6 and the king and hi men went to jerusalem unto the jebusit the 
inhabit of the land which spake unto david say except thou 
take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither 
think david cannot come in hither 

5 7 nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the

5 8 and david said on that day whosoev getteth up to the gutter 
and smiteth the jebusit and the lame and the blind that are hate 
of david s soul he shall be chief and captain wherefor they said 
the blind and the lame shall not come into the hou 

5 9 so david dwelt in the fort and call it the citi of david and 
david built round about from millo and inward 

5 10 and david went on and grew great and the lord god of host wa 
with him 

5 11 and hiram king of tyre sent messeng to david and cedar tree 
and carpent and mason and they built david an hou 

5 12 and david perceiv that the lord had establish him king over 
israel and that he had exalt hi kingdom for hi peopl israel s 
sake 

5 13 and david took him more concubin and wife out of jerusalem 
after he wa come from hebron and there were yet son and daughter 
born to david 

5 14 and these be the name of those that were born unto him in 
jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon 5 15 ibhar 
also and elishua and nepheg and japhia 5 16 and elishama and 
eliada and eliphalet 

5 17 but when the philistin heard that they had anoint david king 
over israel all the philistin came up to seek david and david 
heard of it and went down to the hold 

5 18 the philistin also came and spread themselv in the valley of

5 19 and david enquir of the lord say shall i go up to the 
philistin wilt thou deliv them into mine hand and the lord said

5 20 and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and 
said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemi befor me a the 
breach of water therefor he call the name of that place 
baalperazim 

5 21 and there they left their imag and david and hi men burn

5 22 and the philistin came up yet again and spread themselv in 
the valley of rephaim 

5 23 and when david enquir of the lord he said thou shalt not go 
up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against 
the mulberri tree 

5 24 and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a go in the top 
of the mulberri tree that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then 
shall the lord go out befor thee to smite the host of the 
philistin 

5 25 and david did so a the lord had command him and smote the 
philistin from geba until thou come to gazer 

6 1 again david gather togeth all the chosen men of israel 
thirti thousand 

6 2 and david aro and went with all the peopl that were with him

6 5 and david and all the hou of israel play befor the lord on 
all manner of instrument made of fir wood even on harp and on 
psalteri and on timbrel and on cornet and on cymbal 

6 6 and when they came to nachon s threshingfloor uzzah put forth hi 
hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the ox shook it 

6 7 and the anger of the lord wa kindl against uzzah and god smote

6 8 and david wa displea becau the lord had made a breach upon 
uzzah and he call the name of the place perezuzzah to thi day 

6 9 and david wa afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the 
ark of the lord come to me 6 10 so david would not remov the ark of

saul s daughter look through a window and saw king david leap

said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on 
now mourn apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be a a 
woman that had a long time mourn for the dead 14 3 and come to the 
king and speak on thi manner unto him so joab put the word in her 
mouth 

14 4 and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her 
face to the ground and did obei and said help o king 

14 5 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answer i 
am ind a widow woman and mine husband is dead 

14 6 and thi handmaid had two son and they two strove togeth in 
the field and there wa none to part them but the one smote the 
other and slew him 

14 7 and behold the whole famili is risen against thine handmaid 
and they said deliv him that smote hi brother that we may kill 
him for the life of hi brother whom he slew and we will destroy the 
heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall 
not leav to my husband neither name nor remaind upon the earth 

14 8 and the king said unto the woman go to thine hou and i will 
give charg concern thee 

14 9 and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the 
iniqu be on me and on my father s hou and the king and hi 
throne be guiltless 

14 10 and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to 
me and he shall not touch thee ani more 

14 11 then said she i pray thee let the king rememb the lord thi 
god that thou wouldest not suffer the reveng of blood to destroy 
ani more lest they destroy my son and he said a the lord liveth 
there shall not one hair of thi son fall to the earth 

14 12 then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one 
word unto my lord the king and he said say on 

14 13 and the woman said wherefor then hast thou thought such a 
thing against the peopl of god for the king doth speak thi thing a 
one which is faulti in that the king doth not fetch home again hi 
banish 

14 14 for we must need die and are a water spilt on the ground 
which cannot be gather up again neither doth god respect ani 
person yet doth he devi mean that hi banish be not expel 
from him 

14 15 now therefor that i am come to speak of thi thing unto my lord 
the king it is becau the peopl have made me afraid and thi 
handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king 
will perform the request of hi handmaid 

14 16 for the king will hear to deliv hi handmaid out of the hand 
of the man that would destroy me and my son togeth out of the 
inherit of god 

14 17 then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now 
be comfort for a an angel of god so is my lord the king to 
discern good and bad therefor the lord thi god will be with thee 

14 18 then the king answer and said unto the woman hide not from 
me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said 
let my lord the king now speak 

14 19 and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all 
thi and the woman answer and said a thi soul liveth my lord 
the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought 
that my lord the king hath spoken for thi servant joab he bade me 
and he put all these word in the mouth of thine handmaid 14 20 to 
fetch about thi form of speech hath thi servant joab done thi thing 
and my lord is wise accord to the wisdom of an angel of god to 
know all thing that are in the earth 

14 21 and the king said unto joab behold now i have done thi thing 
go therefor bring the young man absalom again 

14 22 and joab fell to the ground on hi face and bow himself and 
thank the king and joab said to day thi servant knoweth that i 
have found grace in thi sight my lord o king in that the king hath 
fulfil the request of hi servant 

14 23 so joab aro and went to geshur and brought absalom to 
jerusalem 

14 24 and the king said let him turn to hi own hou and let him 
not see my face so absalom return to hi own hou and saw not the 
king s face 

14 25 but in all israel there wa none to be so much prai a 
absalom for hi beauti from the sole of hi foot even to the crown of 
hi head there wa no blemish in him 

14 26 and when he poll hi head for it wa at everi year s end 
that he poll it becau the hair wa heavi on him therefor he 
poll it he weigh the hair of hi head at two hundr shekel 
after the king s weight 

14 27 and unto absalom there were born three son and one daughter 
whose name wa tamar she wa a woman of a fair counten 

14 28 so absalom dwelt two full year in jerusalem and saw not the 
king s face 

14 29 therefor absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king 
but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time 
he would not come 

14 30 therefor he said unto hi servant see joab s field is near 
mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absalom s 
servant set the field on fire 

14 31 then joab aro and came to absalom unto hi hou and said 
unto him wherefor have thi servant set my field on fire 14 32 and 
absalom answer joab behold i sent unto thee say come hither 
that i may send thee to the king to say wherefor am i come from 
geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now 
therefor let me see the king s face and if there be ani iniqu in 
me let him kill me 

14 33 so joab came to the king and told him and when he had call 
for absalom he came to the king and bow himself on hi face to the 
ground befor the king and the king kiss absalom 

15 1 and it came to pa after thi that absalom prepar him 
chariot and hor and fifti men to run befor him 

15 2 and absalom rose up earli and stood besid the way of the gate 
and it wa so that when ani man that had a controversi came to the 
king for judgment then absalom call unto him and said of what 
citi art thou and he said thi servant is of one of the tribe of

15 4 absalom said moreov oh that i were made judg in the land 
that everi man which hath ani suit or cau might come unto me and i 
would do him justic 15 5 and it wa so that when ani man came nigh 
to him to do him obei he put forth hi hand and took him and 
kiss him 

15 6 and on thi manner did absalom to all israel that came to the 
king for judgment so absalom stole the heart of the men of israel 

15 7 and it came to pa after forti year that absalom said unto the 
king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vow unto 
the lord in hebron 

15 8 for thi servant vow a vow while i abod at geshur in syria

15 9 and the king said unto him go in peac so he aro and went to 
hebron 

15 10 but absalom sent spi throughout all the tribe of israel 
say a soon a ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall 
say absalom reigneth in hebron 

15 11 and with absalom went two hundr men out of jerusalem that

thing 

15 12 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonit david s 
counsellor from hi citi even from giloh while he offer 
sacrif and the conspiraci wa strong for the peopl increa 
continu with absalom 

15 13 and there came a messeng to david say the heart of the

weep a they went up 

15 31 and one told david say ahithophel is among the conspir 
with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of 
ahithophel into foolish 

15 32 and it came to pa that when david wa come to the top of the 
mount where he worship god behold hushai the archit came to 
meet him with hi coat rent and earth upon hi head 15 33 unto whom 
david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden 
unto me 15 34 but if thou return to the citi and say unto absalom i 
will be thi servant o king a i have been thi father s servant 
hitherto so will i now also be thi servant then mayest thou for me 
defeat the counsel of ahithophel 

15 35 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the 
priest therefor it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt 
hear out of the king s hou thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar 
the priest 

15 36 behold they have there with them their two son ahimaaz 
zadok s son and jonathan abiathar s son and by them ye shall send 
unto me everi thing that ye can hear 

15 37 so hushai david s friend came into the citi and absalom came 
into jerusalem 

16 1 and when david wa a littl past the top of the hill behold 
ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a coupl of as 
saddl and upon them two hundr loaf of bread and an hundr 
bunch of raisin and an hundr of summer fruit and a bottl of 
wine 

16 2 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba 
said the as be for the king s household to ride on and the bread 
and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such a 
be faint in the wilder may drink 

16 3 and the king said and where is thi master s son and ziba said 
unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day 
shall the hou of israel restor me the kingdom of my father 

16 4 then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertain 
unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbl beseech thee that i may 
find grace in thi sight my lord o king 

16 5 and when king david came to bahurim behold thenc came out a 
man of the famili of the hou of saul whose name wa shimei the son 
of gera he came forth and cur still a he came 

16 6 and he cast stone at david and at all the servant of king 
david and all the peopl and all the mighti men were on hi right 
hand and on hi left 

16 7 and thu said shimei when he cur come out come out thou 
bloodi man and thou man of belial 16 8 the lord hath return upon 
thee all the blood of the hou of saul in whose stead thou hast 
reign and the lord hath deliv the kingdom into the hand of 
absalom thi son and behold thou art taken in thi mischief becau 
thou art a bloodi man 

16 9 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king whi should 
thi dead dog cur my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and 
take off hi head 

16 10 and the king said what have i to do with you ye son of 
zeruiah so let him cur becau the lord hath said unto him cur 
david who shall then say wherefor hast thou done so 16 11 and 
david said to abishai and to all hi servant behold my son which 
came forth of my bowel seeketh my life how much more now may thi 
benjamit do it let him alon and let him cur for the lord hath 
bidden him 

16 12 it may be that the lord will look on mine afflict and that 
the lord will requit me good for hi cur thi day 

16 13 and a david and hi men went by the way shimei went along on 
the hill s side over against him and cur a he went and threw 
stone at him and cast dust 

16 14 and the king and all the peopl that were with him came weari 
and refresh themselv there 

16 15 and absalom and all the peopl the men of israel came to 
jerusalem and ahithophel with him 

16 16 and it came to pa when hushai the archit david s friend 
wa come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the 
king god save the king 

16 17 and absalom said to hushai is thi thi kind to thi friend 
whi wentest thou not with thi friend 16 18 and hushai said unto 
absalom nay but whom the lord and thi peopl and all the men of 
israel choo hi will i be and with him will i abid 

16 19 and again whom should i serv should i not serv in the 
presenc of hi son a i have serv in thi father s presenc so 
will i be in thi presenc 

16 20 then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we 
shall do 

16 21 and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thi father s 
concubin which he hath left to keep the hou and all israel shall 
hear that thou art abhor of thi father then shall the hand of all 
that are with thee be strong 

16 22 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the hou and 
absalom went in unto hi father s concubin in the sight of all 
israel 

16 23 and the counsel of ahithophel which he counsel in those 
day wa a if a man had enquir at the oracl of god so wa all 
the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom 

17 1 moreov ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choo out 
twelv thousand men and i will ari and pursu after david thi 
night 17 2 and i will come upon him while he is weari and weak 
hand and will make him afraid and all the peopl that are with him 
shall flee and i will smite the king onli 17 3 and i will bring back 
all the peopl unto thee the man whom thou seekest is a if all 
return so all the peopl shall be in peac 

17 4 and the say plea absalom well and all the elder of 
israel 

17 5 then said absalom call now hushai the archit also and let u 
hear likewi what he saith 

17 6 and when hushai wa come to absalom absalom spake unto him 
say ahithophel hath spoken after thi manner shall we do after 
hi say if not speak thou 

17 7 and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath 
given is not good at thi time 

17 8 for said hushai thou knowest thi father and hi men that they 
be mighti men and they be chafe in their mind a a bear rob of 
her whelp in the field and thi father is a man of war and will not 
lodg with the peopl 

17 9 behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it 
will come to pa when some of them be overthrown at the first that 
whosoev heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the peopl 
that follow absalom 

17 10 and he also that is valiant whose heart is a the heart of a 
lion shall utterli melt for all israel knoweth that thi father is a 
mighti man and they which be with him are valiant men 

17 11 therefor i counsel that all israel be gener gather unto 
thee from dan even to beersheba a the sand that is by the sea for 
multitud and that thou go to battl in thine own person 

17 12 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found 
and we will light upon him a the dew falleth on the ground and of 
him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so 
much a one 

17 13 moreov if he be gotten into a citi then shall all israel 
bring rope to that citi and we will draw it into the river until 
there be not one small stone found there 

17 14 and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of 
hushai the archit is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the 
lord had appoint to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the 
intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom 

17 15 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priest thu 
and thu did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elder of israel and 
thu and thu have i counsel 

17 16 now therefor send quickli and tell david say lodg not 
thi night in the plain of the wilder but speedili pa over 
lest the king be swallow up and all the peopl that are with him 

17 17 now jonathan and ahimaaz stay by enrogel for they might not 
be seen to come into the citi and a wench went and told them and 
they went and told king david 

17 18 nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went 
both of them away quickli and came to a man s hou in bahurim which 
had a well in hi court whither they went down 

17 19 and the woman took and spread a cover over the well s mouth 
and spread ground corn thereon and the thing wa not known 

17 20 and when absalom s servant came to the woman to the hou they 
said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them 
they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and 
could not find them they return to jerusalem 

17 21 and it came to pa after they were depart that they came up 
out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david 
ari and pa quickli over the water for thu hath ahithophel 
counsel against you 

17 22 then david aro and all the peopl that were with him and 
they pa over jordan by the morn light there lack not one of 
them that wa not gone over jordan 

17 23 and when ahithophel saw that hi counsel wa not follow he 
saddl hi a and aro and gat him home to hi hou to hi 
citi and put hi household in order and hang himself and die 
and wa buri in the sepulchr of hi father 

17 24 then david came to mahanaim and absalom pa over jordan he 
and all the men of israel with him 

17 25 and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab 
which amasa wa a man s son whose name wa ithra an israelit that 
went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab s 
mother 

17 26 so israel and absalom pitch in the land of gilead 

17 27 and it came to pa when david wa come to mahanaim that shobi 
the son of nahash of rabbah of the child of ammon and machir the 
son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadit of rogelim 
17 28 brought bed and bason and earthen vessel and wheat and 
barley and flour and parch corn and bean and lentil and 
parch pul 17 29 and honey and butter and sheep and chee of 
kine for david and for the peopl that were with him to eat for 
they said the peopl is hungri and weari and thirsti in the 
wilder 

18 1 and david number the peopl that were with him and set 
captain of thousand and captain of hundr over them 

18 2 and david sent forth a third part of the peopl under the hand of 
joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah 
joab s brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittit 
and the king said unto the peopl i will sure go forth with you 
myself also 

18 3 but the peopl answer thou shalt not go forth for if we flee 
away they will not care for u neither if half of u die will they 
care for u but now thou art worth ten thousand of u therefor now 
it is better that thou succour u out of the citi 

18 4 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and 
the king stood by the gate side and all the peopl came out by 
hundr and by thousand 

18 5 and the king command joab and abishai and ittai say deal 
gentli for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the 
peopl heard when the king gave all the captain charg concern 
absalom 

18 6 so the peopl went out into the field against israel and the 
battl wa in the wood of ephraim 18 7 where the peopl of israel 
were slain befor the servant of david and there wa there a great 
slaughter that day of twenti thousand men 

18 8 for the battl wa there scatter over the face of all the 
countri and the wood devour more peopl that day than the sword 
devour 

18 9 and absalom met the servant of david and absalom rode upon a 
mule and the mule went under the thick bough of a great oak and hi 
head caught hold of the oak and he wa taken up between the heaven 
and the earth and the mule that wa under him went away 

18 10 and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw 
absalom hang in an oak 

18 11 and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou 
sawest him and whi didst thou not smite him there to the ground and 
i would have given thee ten shekel of silver and a girdl 

18 12 and the man said unto joab though i should receiv a thousand 
shekel of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand 
against the king s son for in our hear the king charg thee and 
abishai and ittai say bewar that none touch the young man 
absalom 

18 13 otherwi i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life 
for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest 
have set thyself against me 

18 14 then said joab i may not tarri thu with thee and he took 
three dart in hi hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom 
while he wa yet aliv in the midst of the oak 

18 15 and ten young men that bare joab s armour compass about and 
smote absalom and slew him 

18 16 and joab blew the trumpet and the peopl return from pursu 
after israel for joab held back the peopl 

18 17 and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the 
wood and laid a veri great heap of stone upon him and all israel 
fled everi one to hi tent 

18 18 now absalom in hi lifetim had taken and rear up for himself 
a pillar which is in the king s dale for he said i have no son to 
keep my name in remembr and he call the pillar after hi own 
name and it is call unto thi day absalom s place 

18 19 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the 
king tide how that the lord hath aveng him of hi enemi 

18 20 and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tide thi day 
but thou shalt bear tide anoth day but thi day thou shalt bear 
no tide becau the king s son is dead 

18 21 then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen 
and cushi bow himself unto joab and ran 

18 22 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but 
howsoev let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said 
wherefor wilt thou run my son see that thou hast no tide 
readi 18 23 but howsoev said he let me run and he said unto 
him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi 

18 24 and david sat between the two gate and the watchman went up to 
the roof over the gate unto the wall and lift up hi eye and 
look and behold a man run alon 

18 25 and the watchman cri and told the king and the king said if 
he be alon there is tide in hi mouth and he came apac and 
drew near 

18 26 and the watchman saw anoth man run and the watchman 
call unto the porter and said behold anoth man run alon 
and the king said he also bringeth tide 

18 27 and the watchman said me thinketh the run of the foremost 
is like the run of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he 
is a good man and cometh with good tide 

18 28 and ahimaaz call and said unto the king all is well and he 
fell down to the earth upon hi face befor the king and said 
bless be the lord thi god which hath deliv up the men that 
lift up their hand against my lord the king 

18 29 and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz 
answer when joab sent the king s servant and me thi servant i saw 
a great tumult but i knew not what it wa 

18 30 and the king said unto him turn asid and stand here and he 
turn asid and stood still 

18 31 and behold cushi came and cushi said tide my lord the 
king for the lord hath aveng thee thi day of all them that rose up 
against thee 

18 32 and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and 
cushi answer the enemi of my lord the king and all that rise 
against thee to do thee hurt be a that young man is 

18 33 and the king wa much move and went up to the chamber over the 
gate and wept and a he went thu he said o my son absalom my 
son my son absalom would god i had die for thee o absalom my son 
my son 19 1 and it wa told joab behold the king weepeth and 
mourneth for absalom 

19 2 and the victori that day wa turn into mourn unto all the 
peopl for the peopl heard say that day how the king wa griev for

19 3 and the peopl gat them by stealth that day into the citi a 
peopl be asham steal away when they flee in battl 

19 4 but the king cover hi face and the king cri with a loud 
voic o my son absalom o absalom my son my son 19 5 and joab 
came into the hou to the king and said thou hast shame thi day 
the face of all thi servant which thi day have save thi life and

wife and the life of thi concubin 19 6 in that thou lovest thine 
enemi and hatest thi friend for thou hast declar thi day that 
thou regardest neither princ nor servant for thi day i perceiv 
that if absalom had live and all we had die thi day then it had 
plea thee well

child and will not keep my command and my statut which i 
have set befor you but go and serv other god and worship them 
9 7 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given 
them and thi hou which i have hallow for my name will i cast 
out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all 
peopl 9 8 and at thi hou which is high everi one that passeth 
by it shall be astonish and shall hiss and they shall say whi 
hath the lord done thu unto thi land and to thi hou 9 9 and 
they shall answer becau they forsook the lord their god who 
brought forth their father out of the land of egypt and have taken

the hou that he had built 10 5 and the meat of hi tabl and the 
sit of hi servant and the attend of hi minist and 
their apparel and hi cupbear and hi ascent by which he went up

11 4 for it came to pa when solomon wa old that hi wife turn 
away hi heart after other god and hi heart wa not perfect with 
the lord hi god a wa the heart of david hi father 

11 5 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonian 
and after milcom the abomin of the ammonit 

11 6 and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fulli 
after the lord a did david hi father 

11 7 then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomin 
of moab in the hill that is befor jerusalem and for molech the 
abomin of the child of ammon

from the lord god of israel which had appear unto him twice 11 10 
and had command him concern thi thing that he should not go 
after other god but he kept not that which the lord command 

11 11 wherefor the lord said unto solomon forasmuch a thi is done 
of thee and thou hast not kept my coven and my statut which i 
have command thee i will sure rend the kingdom from thee and 
will give it to thi servant 

11 12 notwithstand in thi day i will not do it for david thi 
father s sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thi son 

11 13 howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one 
tribe to thi son for david my servant s sake and for jerusalem s sake 
which i have chosen 

11 14 and the lord stir up an adversari unto solomon hadad the 
edomit he wa of the king s seed in edom 

11 15 for it came to pa when david wa in edom and joab the 
captain of the host wa gone up to buri the slain after he had 
smitten everi male in edom 11 16 for six month did joab remain 
there with all israel until he had cut off everi male in edom 11 17 
that hadad fled he and certain edomit of hi father s servant with 
him to go into egypt hadad be yet a littl child 

11 18 and they aro out of midian and came to paran and they took 
men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king 
of egypt which gave him an hou and appoint him victual and 
gave him land 

11 19 and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he 
gave him to wife the sister of hi own wife the sister of tahpen 
the queen 

11 20 and the sister of tahpen bare him genubath hi son whom 
tahpen wean in pharaoh s hou and genubath wa in pharaoh s 
household among the son of pharaoh 

11 21 and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with hi father 
and that joab the captain of the host wa dead hadad said to pharaoh 
let me depart that i may go to mine own countri 

11 22 then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lack with me 
that behold thou seekest to go to thine own countri and he 
answer noth howbeit let me go in ani wise 

11 23 and god stir him up anoth adversari rezon the son of 
eliadah which fled from hi lord hadadez king of zobah 11 24 and 
he gather men unto him and becam captain over a band when david 
slew them of zobah and they went to damascu and dwelt therein and 
reign in damascu 

11 25 and he wa an adversari to israel all the day of solomon 
besid the mischief that hadad did and he abhor israel and 
reign over syria 

11 26 and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathit of zereda 
solomon s servant whose mother s name wa zeruah a widow woman even 
he lift up hi hand against the king 

11 27 and thi wa the cau that he lift up hi hand against the 
king solomon built millo and repair the breach of the citi of 
david hi father 

11 28 and the man jeroboam wa a mighti man of valour and solomon 
see the young man that he wa industri he made him ruler over 
all the charg of the hou of joseph 

11 29 and it came to pa at that time when jeroboam went out of 
jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonit found him in the way 
and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alon in 
the field 11 30 and ahijah caught the new garment that wa on him 
and rent it in twelv piec 11 31 and he said to jeroboam take thee 
ten piec for thu saith the lord the god of israel behold i will 
rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribe 
to thee 11 32 but he shall have one tribe for my servant david s 
sake and for jerusalem s sake the citi which i have chosen out of 
all the tribe of israel 11 33 becau that they have forsaken me 
and have worship ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonian chemosh 
the god of the moabit and milcom the god of the child of ammon 
and have not walk in my way to do that which is right in mine 
eye and to keep my statut and my judgment a did david hi 
father 

11 34 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of hi hand but i 
will make him princ all the day of hi life for david my servant s 
sake whom i chose becau he kept my command and my statut 
11 35 but i will take the kingdom out of hi son s hand and will give 
it unto thee even ten tribe 

11 36 and unto hi son will i give one tribe that david my servant 
may have a light alway befor me in jerusalem the citi which i have 
chosen me to put my name there 

11 37 and i will take thee and thou shalt reign accord to all that 
thi soul desireth and shalt be king over israel 

11 38 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command 
thee and wilt walk in my way and do that is right in my sight to 
keep my statut and my command a david my servant did that i 
will be with thee and build thee a sure hou a i built for david 
and will give israel unto thee 

11 39 and i will for thi afflict the seed of david but not for ever 

11 40 solomon sought therefor to kill jeroboam and jeroboam aro 
and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and wa in egypt 
until the death of solomon 

11 41 and the rest of the act of solomon and all that he did and 
hi wisdom are they not written in the book of the act of solomon 
11 42 and the time that solomon reign in jerusalem over all israel 
wa forti year 

11 43 and solomon slept with hi father and wa buri in the citi 
of david hi father and rehoboam hi son reign in hi stead 

12 1 and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem 
to make him king 

12 2 and it came to pa when jeroboam the son of nebat who wa yet 
in egypt heard of it for he wa fled from the presenc of king 
solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt 12 3 that they sent and call 
him and jeroboam and all the congreg of israel came and spake 
unto rehoboam say 12 4 thi father made our yoke grievou now 
therefor make thou the grievou servic of thi father and hi heavi 
yoke which he put upon u lighter and we will serv thee 

12 5 and he said unto them depart yet for three day then come again 
to me and the peopl depart 

12 6 and king rehoboam consult with the old men that stood befor 
solomon hi father while he yet live and said how do ye advi that 
i may answer thi peopl 12 7 and they spake unto him say if 
thou wilt be a servant unto thi peopl thi day and wilt serv them 
and answer them and speak good word to them then they will be thi 
servant for ever 

12 8 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given 
him and consult with the young men that were grown up with him and 
which stood befor him 12 9 and he said unto them what counsel give 
ye that we may answer thi peopl who have spoken to me say make 
the yoke which thi father did put upon u lighter 12 10 and the 
young men that were grown up with him spake unto him say thu 
shalt thou speak unto thi peopl that spake unto thee say thi 
father made our yoke heavi but make thou it lighter unto u thu 
shalt thou say unto them my littl finger shall be thicker than my 
father s loin 

12 11 and now wherea my father did lade you with a heavi yoke i will 
add to your yoke my father hath chasti you with whip but i will 
chasti you with scorpion 

12 12 so jeroboam and all the peopl came to rehoboam the third day 
a the king had appoint say come to me again the third day 

12 13 and the king answer the peopl roughli and forsook the old 
men s counsel that they gave him 12 14 and spake to them after the 
counsel of the young men say my father made your yoke heavi and 
i will add to your yoke my father also chasti you with whip but 
i will chasti you with scorpion 

12 15 wherefor the king hearken not unto the peopl for the cau 
wa from the lord that he might perform hi say which the lord 
spake by ahijah the shilonit unto jeroboam the son of nebat 

12 16 so when all israel saw that the king hearken not unto them 
the peopl answer the king say what portion have we in david 
neither have we inherit in the son of jess to your tent o 
israel now see to thine own hou david so israel depart unto 
their tent 

12 17 but a for the child of israel which dwelt in the citi of 
judah rehoboam reign over them 

12 18 then king rehoboam sent adoram who wa over the tribut and 
all israel stone him with stone that he die therefor king 
rehoboam made speed to get him up to hi chariot to flee to 
jerusalem 

12 19 so israel rebel against the hou of david unto thi day 

12 20 and it came to pa when all israel heard that jeroboam wa 
come again that they sent and call him unto the congreg and 
made him king over all israel there wa none that follow the hou 
of david but the tribe of judah onli 

12 21 and when rehoboam wa come to jerusalem he assembl all the 
hou of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundr and fourscor 
thousand chosen men which were warrior to fight against the hou 
of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon 

12 22 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god say 
12 23 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto 
all the hou of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the peopl 
say 12 24 thu saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight 
against your brother the child of israel return everi man to hi 
hou for thi thing is from me they hearken therefor to the word 
of the lord and return to depart accord to the word of the 
lord 

12 25 then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein 
and went out from thenc and built penuel 

12 26 and jeroboam said in hi heart now shall the kingdom return to 
the hou of david 12 27 if thi peopl go up to do sacrif in the 
hou of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of thi peopl 
turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they 
shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah 

12 28 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calf of gold 
and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem 
behold thi god o israel which brought thee up out of the land of 
egypt 

12 29 and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan 

12 30 and thi thing becam a sin for the peopl went to worship 
befor the one even unto dan 

12 31 and he made an hou of high place and made priest of the 
lowest of the peopl which were not of the son of levi 

12 32 and jeroboam ordain a feast in the eighth month on the 
fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and 
he offer upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrif unto the 
calf that he had made and he place in bethel the priest of the 
high place which he had made 

12 33 so he offer upon the altar which he had made in bethel the 
fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had 
devi of hi own heart and ordain a feast unto the child of 
israel and he offer upon the altar and burnt incen 

13 1 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of 
the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incen 

13 2 and he cri against the altar in the word of the lord and said 
o altar altar thu saith the lord behold a child shall be born 
unto the hou of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer 
the priest of the high place that burn incen upon thee and men s 
bone shall be burnt upon thee 

13 3 and he gave a sign the same day say thi is the sign which 
the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ash 
that are upon it shall be pour out 

13 4 and it came to pa when king jeroboam heard the say of the 
man of god which had cri against the altar in bethel that he put 
forth hi hand from the altar say lay hold on him and hi hand 
which he put forth against him dri up so that he could not pull it 
in again to him 

13 5 the altar also wa rent and the ash pour out from the altar 
accord to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of 
the lord 

13 6 and the king answer and said unto the man of god intreat now 
the face of the lord thi god and pray for me that my hand may be 
restor me again and the man of god besought the lord and the 
king s hand wa restor him again and becam a it wa befor 

13 7 and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and 
refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward 

13 8 and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half 
thine hou i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor 
drink water in thi place 13 9 for so wa it charg me by the word 
of the lord say eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by 
the same way that thou camest 

13 10 so he went anoth way and return not by the way that he came 
to bethel 

13 11 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and hi son came and 
told him all the work that the man of god had done that day in 
bethel the word which he had spoken unto the king them they told 
also to their father 

13 12 and their father said unto them what way went he for hi son 
had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah 

13 13 and he said unto hi son saddl me the a so they saddl 
him the a and he rode thereon 13 14 and went after the man of god 
and found him sit under an oak and he said unto him art thou the 
man of god that camest from judah and he said i am 

13 15 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread 

13 16 and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee 
neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in thi place 
13 17 for it wa said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no 
bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou 
camest 

13 18 he said unto him i am a prophet also a thou art and an angel 
spake unto me by the word of the lord say bring him back with 
thee into thine hou that he may eat bread and drink water but he 
lie unto him 

13 19 so he went back with him and did eat bread in hi hou and 
drank water 

13 20 and it came to pa a they sat at the tabl that the word of 
the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back 13 21 and he 
cri unto the man of god that came from judah say thu saith the 
lord forasmuch a thou hast disobey the mouth of the lord and hast 
not kept the command which the lord thi god command thee 13 22 
but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of 
the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water 
thi carca shall not come unto the sepulchr of thi father 

13 23 and it came to pa after he had eaten bread and after he had 
drunk that he saddl for him the a to wit for the prophet whom 
he had brought back 

13 24 and when he wa gone a lion met him by the way and slew him 
and hi carca wa cast in the way and the a stood by it the lion 
also stood by the carca 

13 25 and behold men pa by and saw the carca cast in the way 
and the lion stand by the carca and they came and told it in the 
citi where the old prophet dwelt 

13 26 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard 
thereof he said it is the man of god who wa disobedi unto the 
word of the lord therefor the lord hath deliv him unto the lion 
which hath torn him and slain him accord to the word of the lord 
which he spake unto him 

13 27 and he spake to hi son say saddl me the a and they

13 28 and he went and found hi carca cast in the way and the a 
and the lion stand by the carca the lion had not eaten the 
carca nor torn the a 

13 29 and the prophet took up the carca of the man of god and laid 
it upon the a and brought it back and the old prophet came to the 
citi to mourn and to buri him 

13 30 and he laid hi carca in hi own grave and they mourn over

had buri him that he spake to hi son say when i am dead 
then buri me in the sepulchr wherein the man of god is buri lay my 
bone besid hi bone 13 32 for the say which he cri by the 
word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the 
hou of the high place which are in the citi of samaria shall

13 33 after thi thing jeroboam return not from hi evil way but 
made again of the lowest of the peopl priest of the high place 
whosoev would he consecr him and he becam one of the priest 
of the high place 

13 34 and thi thing becam sin unto the hou of jeroboam even to 
cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth 

14 1 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick 

14 2 and jeroboam said to hi wife ari i pray thee and disgui 
thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get 
thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me 
that i should be king over thi peopl 

14 3 and take with thee ten loaf and cracknel and a cruse of 
honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall becom of the

came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam whi 
feignest thou thyself to be anoth for i am sent to thee with heavi 
tide 

14 7 go tell jeroboam thu saith the lord god of israel forasmuch

2 16 and they said unto him behold now there be with thi servant 
fifti strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thi master lest

citi is pleasant a my lord seeth but the water is naught and the 
ground barren 

2 20 and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they 
brought it to him 

2 21 and he went forth unto the spring of the water and cast the 
salt in there and said thu saith the lord i have heal these

and tare forti and two child of them 

2 25 and he went from thenc to mount carmel and from thenc he

3 1 now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria 
the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reign twelv 
year 

3 2 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like hi 
father and like hi mother for he put away the imag of baal that 
hi father had made 

3 3 nevertheless he cleav unto the sin of jeroboam the son of 
nebat which made israel to sin he depart not therefrom 

3 4 and mesha king of moab wa a sheepmast and render unto the 
king of israel an hundr thousand lamb and an hundr thousand 
ram with the wool 

3 5 but it came to pa when ahab wa dead that the king of moab

3 6 and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and number 
all israel 

3 7 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah say the 
king of moab hath rebel against me wilt thou go with me against 
moab to battl and he said i will go up i am a thou art my peopl 
a thi peopl and my hor a thi hor 

3 8 and he said which way shall we go up and he answer the way 
through the wilder of edom 

3 9 so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of 
edom and they fetch a compass of seven day journey and there wa 
no water for the host and for the cattl that follow them 

3 10 and the king of israel said ala that the lord hath call 
these three king togeth to deliv them into the hand of moab 
3 11 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord 
that we may enquir of the lord by him and one of the king of 
israel s servant answer and said here is elisha the son of 
shaphat which pour water on the hand of elijah 

3 12 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the 
king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him 

3 13 and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with 
thee get thee to the prophet of thi father and to the prophet of 
thi mother 

and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath call 
these three king togeth to deliv them into the hand of moab 

3 14 and elisha said a the lord of host liveth befor whom i 
stand sure were it not that i regard the presenc of jehoshaphat 
the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee 

3 15 but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pa when the 
minstrel play that the hand of the lord came upon him 

3 16 and he said thu saith the lord make thi valley full of 
ditch 

3 17 for thu saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye 
see rain yet that valley shall be fill with water that ye may 
drink both ye and your cattl and your beast 

3 18 and thi is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will 
deliv the moabit also into your hand 

3 19 and ye shall smite everi fenc citi and everi choic citi and 
shall fell everi good tree and stop all well of water and mar everi 
good piec of land with stone 

3 20 and it came to pa in the morn when the meat offer wa 
offer that behold there came water by the way of edom and the 
countri wa fill with water 

3 21 and when all the moabit heard that the king were come up to 
fight against them they gather all that were abl to put on armour 
and upward and stood in the border 

3 22 and they rose up earli in the morn and the sun shone upon the 
water and the moabit saw the water on the other side a red a 
blood 3 23 and they said thi is blood the king are sure slain 
and they have smitten one anoth now therefor moab to the spoil 

3 24 and when they came to the camp of israel the israelit rose up 
and smote the moabit so that they fled befor them but they went 
forward smite the moabit even in their countri 

3 25 and they beat down the citi and on everi good piec of land 
cast everi man hi stone and fill it and they stop all the 
well of water and fell all the good tree onli in kirharaseth 
left they the stone thereof howbeit the slinger went about it and 
smote it 

3 26 and when the king of moab saw that the battl wa too sore for 
him he took with him seven hundr men that drew sword to break 
through even unto the king of edom but they could not 

3 27 then he took hi eldest son that should have reign in hi 
stead and offer him for a burnt offer upon the wall and there 
wa great indign against israel and they depart from him and 
return to their own land 

4 1 now there cri a certain woman of the wife of the son of the 
prophet unto elisha say thi servant my husband is dead and thou 
knowest that thi servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come 
to take unto him my two son to be bondman

6 20 and it came to pa when they were come into samaria that 
elisha said lord open the eye of these men that they may see and 
the lord open their eye and they saw and behold they were in 
the midst of samaria 

6 21 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my

taken captiv with thi sword and with thi bow set bread and water 
befor them that they may eat and drink and go to their master 

6 23 and he prepar great provi for them and when they had eaten

assyria shut him up and bound him in prison 

17 5 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and 
went up to samaria and besieg it three year 

17 6 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and 
carri israel away into assyria and place them in halah and in 
habor by the river of gozan and in the citi of the mede 

17 7 for so it wa that the child of israel had sin against the 
lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt 
from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had fear other 
god 17 8 and walk in the statut of the heathen whom the lord 
cast out from befor the child of israel and of the king of 
israel which they had made 

17 9 and the child of israel did secretli those thing that were 
not right against the lord their god and they built them high place 
in all their citi from the tower of the watchman to the fenc 
citi 

17 10 and they set them up imag and grove in everi high hill and 
under everi green tree 17 11 and there they burnt incen in all the 
high place a did the heathen whom the lord carri away befor 
them and wrought wick thing to provok the lord to anger 17 12 
for they serv idol whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall 
not do thi thing 

17 13 yet the lord testifi against israel and against judah by all 
the prophet and by all the seer say turn ye from your evil 
way and keep my command and my statut accord to all the 
law which i command your father and which i sent to you by my 
servant the prophet 

17 14 notwithstand they would not hear but harden their neck 
like to the neck of their father that did not believ in the lord 
their god 

17 15 and they reject hi statut and hi coven that he made 
with their father and hi testimoni which he testifi against 
them and they follow vaniti and becam vain and went after the 
heathen that were round about them concern whom the lord had 
charg them that they should not do like them 

17 16 and they left all the command of the lord their god and 
made them molten imag even two calf and made a grove and 
worship all the host of heaven and serv baal 

17 17 and they cau their son and their daughter to pa through 
the fire and use divin and enchant and sold themselv to 
do evil in the sight of the lord to provok him to anger 

17 18 therefor the lord wa veri angri with israel and remov them 
out of hi sight there wa none left but the tribe of judah onli 

17 19 also judah kept not the command of the lord their god but 
walk in the statut of israel which they made 

17 20 and the lord reject all the seed of israel and afflict 
them and deliv them into the hand of spoiler until he had cast 
them out of hi sight 

17 21 for he rent israel from the hou of david and they made 
jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from 
follow the lord and made them sin a great sin 

17 22 for the child of israel walk in all the sin of jeroboam 
which he did they depart not from them 17 23 until the lord 
remov israel out of hi sight a he had said by all hi servant 
the prophet so wa israel carri away out of their own land to 
assyria unto thi day 

17 24 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from 
cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and place 
them in the citi of samaria instead of the child of israel and 
they poss samaria and dwelt in the citi thereof 

17 25 and so it wa at the begin of their dwell there that 
they fear not the lord therefor the lord sent lion among them 
which slew some of them 

17 26 wherefor they spake to the king of assyria say the nation 
which thou hast remov and place in the citi of samaria know not 
the manner of the god of the land therefor he hath sent lion among 
them and behold they slay them becau they know not the manner of 
the god of the land 

17 27 then the king of assyria command say carri thither one of 
the priest whom ye brought from thenc and let them go and dwell 
there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land 

17 28 then one of the priest whom they had carri away from samaria 
came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the 
lord 

17 29 howbeit everi nation made god of their own and put them in the 
hou of the high place which the samaritan had made everi nation 
in their citi wherein they dwelt 

17 30 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth 
made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima 17 31 and the avit 
made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvit burnt their child in 
fire to adrammelech and anammelech the god of sepharvaim 

17 32 so they fear the lord and made unto themselv of the lowest 
of them priest of the high place which sacrif for them in the 
hou of the high place 

17 33 they fear the lord and serv their own god after the 
manner of the nation whom they carri away from thenc 

17 34 unto thi day they do after the former manner they fear not 
the lord neither do they after their statut or after their 
ordin or after the law and command which the lord command 
the child of jacob whom he name israel 17 35 with whom the lord 
had made a coven and charg them say ye shall not fear other 
god nor bow yourselv to them nor serv them nor sacrif to 
them 17 36 but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt 
with great power and a stretch out arm him shall ye fear and him 
shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrif 

17 37 and the statut and the ordin and the law and the 
command which he wrote for you ye shall observ to do for 
evermor and ye shall not fear other god 

17 38 and the coven that i have made with you ye shall not forget 
neither shall ye fear other god 

17 39 but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliv you 
out of the hand of all your enemi 

17 40 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former 
manner 

17 41 so these nation fear the lord and serv their graven 
imag both their child and their child s child a did 
their father so do they unto thi day 

18 1 now it came to pa in the third year of hoshea son of elah king 
of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign 

18 2 twenti and five year old wa he when he began to reign and he

18 4 he remov the high place and brake the imag and cut down 
the grove and brake in piec the brasen serpent that mose had 
made for unto those day the child of israel did burn incen to 
it and he call it nehushtan 

18 5 he trust in the lord god of israel so that after him wa none 
like him among all the king of judah nor ani that were befor him 

18 6 for he clave to the lord and depart not from follow him 
but kept hi command which the lord command mose 

18 7 and the lord wa with him and he prosper whithersoev he went 
forth and he rebel against the king of assyria and serv him 
not 

18 8 he smote the philistin even unto gaza and the border 
thereof from the tower of the watchman to the fenc citi

samaria wa taken 

18 11 and the king of assyria did carri away israel unto assyria and 
put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the 
citi of the mede 18 12 becau they obey not the voic of the 
lord their god but transgress hi coven and all that mose the 
servant of the lord command and would not hear them nor do them 

18 13 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king 
of assyria come up against all the fenc citi of judah and took 
them 

18 14 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to

puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appoint unto 
hezekiah king of judah three hundr talent of silver and thirti 
talent of gold 

18 15 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that wa found in the hou 
of the lord and in the treasur of the king s hou 

18 16 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the door of the 
templ of the lord and from the pillar which hezekiah king of judah 
had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria 

18 17 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsari and rabshakeh 
from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and 
they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they 
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the 
highway of the fuller s field 

18 18 and when they had call to the king there came out to them 
eliakim the son of hilkiah which wa over the household and shebna 
the scribe and joah the son of asaph the record 

18 19 and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thu 
saith the great king the king of assyria what confid is thi 
wherein thou trustest 18 20 thou sayest but they are but vain 
word i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou 
trust that thou rebellest against me 18 21 now behold thou 
trustest upon the staff of thi brui reed even upon egypt on 
which if a man lean it will go into hi hand and pierc it so is 
pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him 

18 22 but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that 
he whose high place and whose altar hezekiah hath taken away and 
hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship befor thi altar 
in jerusalem 18 23 now therefor i pray thee give pledg to my 
lord the king of assyria and i will deliv thee two thousand hor 
if thou be abl on thi part to set rider upon them 

18 24 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the

lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the 
shadow go forward ten degr or go back ten degr 20 10 and 
hezekiah answer it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten 
degr nay but let the shadow return backward ten degr 

20 11 and isaiah the prophet cri unto the lord and he brought the 
shadow ten degr backward by which it had gone down in the dial of

21 10 and the lord spake by hi servant the prophet say 21 11 
becau manasseh king of judah hath done these abomin and hath 
done wickedli abov all that the amorit did which were befor him 
and hath made judah also to sin with hi idol 21 12 therefor thu

10 19 and israel rebel against the hou of david unto thi day 

11 1 and when rehoboam wa come to jerusalem he gather of the hou 
of judah and benjamin an hundr and fourscor thousand chosen men 
which were warrior to fight against israel that he might bring the

11 6 he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa 11 7 and bethzur 
and shoco and adullam 11 8 and gath and mareshah and ziph 11 9

11 13 and the priest and the levit that were in all israel resort 
to him out of all their coast 

11 14 for the levit left their suburb and their poss and

off from execut the priest s offic unto the lord 11 15 and he 
ordain him priest for the high place and for the devil and for

11 16 and after them out of all the tribe of israel such a set their 
heart to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrif 
unto the lord god of their father 

11 17 so they strengthen the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the 
son of solomon strong three year for three year they walk in the 
way of david and solomon 

11 18 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son 
of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jess 
11 19 which bare him child jeush and shamariah and zaham 

11 20 and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which 
bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith 

11 21 and rehoboam love maachah the daughter of absalom abov all hi

king 

11 23 and he dealt wise and disper of all hi child 
throughout all the countri of judah and benjamin unto everi fenc 
citi and he gave them victual in abund and he desir mani 
wife 

12 1 and it came to pa when rehoboam had establish the kingdom 
and had strengthen himself he forsook the law of the lord and all 
israel with him 

12 2 and it came to pa that in the fifth year of king rehoboam 
shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem becau they had 
transgress against the lord 12 3 with twelv hundr chariot and 
threescor thousand horseman and the peopl were without number that 
came with him out of egypt the lubim the sukkiim and the 
ethiopian 

12 4 and he took the fenc citi which pertain to judah and came 
to jerusalem 

12 5 then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princ of 
judah that were gather togeth to jerusalem becau of shishak 
and said unto them thu saith the lord ye have forsaken me and 
therefor have i also left you in the hand of shishak 

12 6 whereupon the princ of israel and the king humbl themselv 
and they said the lord is righteou 

12 7 and when the lord saw that they humbl themselv the word of 
the lord came to shemaiah say they have humbl themselv 
therefor i will not destroy them but i will grant them some 
deliv and my wrath shall not be pour out upon jerusalem by 
the hand of shishak 

12 8 nevertheless they shall be hi servant that they may know my 
servic and the servic of the kingdom of the countri 

12 9 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away 
the treasur of the hou of the lord and the treasur of the 
king s hou he took all he carri away also the shield of gold 
which solomon had made 

12 10 instead of which king rehoboam made shield of brass and

entranc of the king s hou 

12 11 and when the king enter into the hou of the lord the guard 
came and fetch them and brought them again into the guard chamber 

12 12 and when he humbl himself the wrath of the lord turn from 
him that he would not destroy him altogeth and also in judah 
thing went well 

12 13 so king rehoboam strengthen himself in jerusalem and reign 
for rehoboam wa one and forti year old when he began to reign and 
he reign seventeen year in jerusalem the citi which the lord had 
chosen out of all the tribe of israel to put hi name there and hi 
mother s name wa naamah an ammonit 

12 14 and he did evil becau he prepar not hi heart to seek the 
lord 

12 15 now the act of rehoboam first and last are they not written 
in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concern 
genealog and there were war between rehoboam and jeroboam 
continu 

12 16 and rehoboam slept with hi father and wa buri in the citi 
of david and abijah hi son reign in hi stead 

13 1 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign 
over judah 

13 2 he reign three year in jerusalem hi mother s name also wa 
michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there wa war between 
abijah and jeroboam 

13 3 and abijah set the battl in array with an armi of valiant men of 
war even four hundr thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the 
battl in array against him with eight hundr thousand chosen men 
be mighti men of valour 

13 4 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount 
ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel 13 5 ought 
ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over 
israel to david for ever even to him and to hi son by a coven of 
salt 13 6 yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the 
son of david is risen up and hath rebel against hi lord 

13 7 and there are gather unto him vain men the child of belial 
and have strengthen themselv against rehoboam the son of solomon 
when rehoboam wa young and tenderheart and could not withstand 
them 

13 8 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand 
of the son of david and ye be a great multitud and there are with 
your golden calf which jeroboam made you for god 

13 9 have ye not cast out the priest of the lord the son of aaron 
and the levit and have made you priest after the manner of the 
nation of other land so that whosoev cometh to consecr himself 
with a young bullock and seven ram the same may be a priest of them 
that are no god 

13 10 but a for u the lord is our god and we have not forsaken 
him and the priest which minist unto the lord are the son of 
aaron and the levit wait upon their busi 13 11 and they burn 
unto the lord everi morn and everi even burnt sacrif and 
sweet incen the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure 
tabl and the candlestick of gold with the lamp thereof to burn 
everi even for we keep the charg of the lord our god but ye have 
forsaken him 

13 12 and behold god himself is with u for our captain and hi 
priest with sound trumpet to cri alarm against you o child of 
israel fight ye not against the lord god of your father for ye 
shall not prosper 

13 13 but jeroboam cau an ambush to come about behind them so 
they were befor judah and the ambush wa behind them 

13 14 and when judah look back behold the battl wa befor and 
behind and they cri unto the lord and the priest sound with the 
trumpet 

13 15 then the men of judah gave a shout and a the men of judah 
shout it came to pa that god smote jeroboam and all israel 
befor abijah and judah 

13 16 and the child of israel fled befor judah and god deliv 
them into their hand 

13 17 and abijah and hi peopl slew them with a great slaughter so 
there fell down slain of israel five hundr thousand chosen men 

13 18 thu the child of israel were brought under at that time and 
the child of judah prevail becau they reli upon the lord god 
of their father 

13 19 and abijah pursu after jeroboam and took citi from him 
bethel with the town thereof and jeshanah with the town thereof 
and ephraim with the town thereof 

13 20 neither did jeroboam recov strength again in the day of 
abijah and the lord struck him and he die 

13 21 but abijah wax mighti and marri fourteen wife and begat 
twenti and two son and sixteen daughter 

13 22 and the rest of the act of abijah and hi way and hi 
say are written in the stori of the prophet iddo 

14 1 so abijah slept with hi father and they buri him in the citi 
of david and asa hi son reign in hi stead in hi day the land 
wa quiet ten year 

14 2 and asa did that which wa good and right in the eye of the lord 
hi god 14 3 for he took away the altar of the strang god and the 
high place and brake down the imag and cut down the grove 14 4 
and command judah to seek the lord god of their father and to do 
the law and the command 

14 5 also he took away out of all the citi of judah the high place 
and the imag and the kingdom wa quiet befor him 

14 6 and he built fenc citi in judah for the land had rest and 
he had no war in those year becau the lord had given him rest 

14 7 therefor he said unto judah let u build these citi and make 
about them wall and tower gate and bar while the land is yet 
befor u becau we have sought the lord our god we have sought 
him and he hath given u rest on everi side so they built and 
prosper 

14 8 and asa had an armi of men that bare target and spear out of 
judah three hundr thousand and out of benjamin that bare shield 
and drew bow two hundr and fourscor thousand all these were 
mighti men of valour 

14 9 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host 
of a thousand thousand and three hundr chariot and came unto 
mareshah 

14 10 then asa went out against him and they set the battl in array 
in the valley of zephathah at mareshah 

14 11 and asa cri unto the lord hi god and said lord it is 
noth with thee to help whether with mani or with them that have 
no power help u o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thi 
name we go against thi multitud o lord thou art our god let no 
man prevail against thee 

14 12 so the lord smote the ethiopian befor asa and befor judah 
and the ethiopian fled 

14 13 and asa and the peopl that were with him pursu them unto 
gerar and the ethiopian were overthrown that they could not recov 
themselv for they were destroy befor the lord and befor hi 
host and they carri away veri much spoil 

14 14 and they smote all the citi round about gerar for the fear of 
the lord came upon them and they spoil all the citi for there 
wa exceed much spoil in them 

14 15 they smote also the tent of cattl and carri away sheep and 
camel in abund and return to jerusalem 

15 1 and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of ode 15 2 and 
he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all 
judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if 
ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsak him he will 
forsak you 

15 3 now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and 
without a teach priest and without law 

15 4 but when they in their troubl did turn unto the lord god of 
israel and sought him he wa found of them 

15 5 and in those time there wa no peac to him that went out nor 
to him that came in but great vexat were upon all the inhabit 
of the countri 

15 6 and nation wa destroy of nation and citi of citi for god did 
vex them with all adver 

15 7 be ye strong therefor and let not your hand be weak for your 
work shall be reward 

15 8 and when asa heard these word and the propheci of ode the 
prophet he took courag and put away the abomin idol out of all 
the land of judah and benjamin and out of the citi which he had 
taken from mount ephraim and renew the altar of the lord that wa 
befor the porch of the lord 

15 9 and he gather all judah and benjamin and the stranger with 
them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to 
him out of israel in abund when they saw that the lord hi god 
wa with him 

15 10 so they gather themselv togeth at jerusalem in the third 
month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa 

15 11 and they offer unto the lord the same time of the spoil which 
they had brought seven hundr ox and seven thousand sheep 

15 12 and they enter into a coven to seek the lord god of their 
father with all their heart and with all their soul 15 13 that 
whosoev would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to 
death whether small or great whether man or woman 

15 14 and they sware unto the lord with a loud voic and with 
shout and with trumpet and with cornet 

15 15 and all judah rejoic at the oath for they had sworn with all 
their heart and sought him with their whole desir and he wa found 
of them and the lord gave them rest round about 

15 16 and also concern maachah the mother of asa the king he 
remov her from be queen becau she had made an idol in a grove 
and asa cut down her idol and stamp it and burnt it at the brook 
kidron 

15 17 but the high place were not taken away out of israel 
nevertheless the heart of asa wa perfect all hi day 

15 18 and he brought into the hou of god the thing that hi father 
had dedic and that he himself had dedic silver and gold 
and vessel 

15 19 and there wa no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of 
the reign of asa 

16 1 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of 
israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he 
might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah 

16 2 then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasur of the 
hou of the lord and of the king s hou and sent to benhadad king 
of syria that dwelt at damascu say 16 3 there is a leagu 
between me and thee a there wa between my father and thi father

16 4 and benhadad hearken unto king asa and sent the captain of

and abelmaim and all the store citi of naphtali 

16 5 and it came to pa when baasha heard it that he left off 
build of ramah and let hi work cea 

16 6 then asa the king took all judah and they carri away the 
stone of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha wa 
build and he built therewith geba and mizpah 

16 7 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and 
said unto him becau thou hast reli on the king of syria and not

16 9 for the eye of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole 
earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is 
perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishli therefor from 
henceforth thou shalt have war 

16 10 then asa wa wroth with the seer and put him in a prison hou 
for he wa in a rage with him becau of thi thing and asa oppress 
some of the peopl the same time 

16 11 and behold the act of asa first and last lo they are

16 13 and asa slept with hi father and die in the one and fortieth

way of hi father david and sought not unto baalim 17 4 but sought

17 6 and hi heart wa lift up in the way of the lord moreov he 
took away the high place and grove out of judah

taught the peopl 

17 10 and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdom of the land 
that were round about judah so that they made no war against

said let not the king say so 

18 8 and the king of israel call for one of hi offic and said

of them on hi throne cloth in their robe and they sat in a void 
place at the enter in of the gate of samaria and all the prophet 
prophesi befor them 

18 10 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horn of iron

they be consum 

18 11 and all the prophet prophesi so say go up to 
ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliv it into the hand

18 12 and the messeng that went to call micaiah spake to him 
say behold the word of the prophet declar good to the king 
with one assent let thi word therefor i pray thee be like one of 
their s and speak thou good 

18 13 and micaiah said a the lord liveth even what my god saith

18 14 and when he wa come to the king the king said unto him 
micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battl or shall i forbear 
and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be deliv into 
your hand 

18 15 and the king said to him how mani time shall i adjur thee 
that thou say noth but the truth to me in the name of the lord 
18 16 then he said i did see all israel scatter upon the mountain 
a sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no 
master let them return therefor everi man to hi hou in peac 

18 17 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee 
that he would not prophesi good unto me but evil 18 18 again he 
said therefor hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sit upon 
hi throne and all the host of heaven stand on hi right hand and

18 19 and the lord said who shall entic ahab king of israel that he 
may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake say after thi 
manner and anoth say after that manner 

18 20 then there came out a spirit and stood befor the lord and

also prevail go out and do even so 

18 22 now therefor behold the lord hath put a lie spirit in the 
mouth of these thi prophet and the lord hath spoken evil against

18 23 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah 
upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from 
me to speak unto thee 18 24 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see 
on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself 

18 25 then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carri him 
back to amon the governor of the citi and to joash the king s son 
18 26 and say thu saith the king put thi fellow in the prison and 
feed him with bread of afflict and with water of afflict until 
i return in peac 

18 27 and micaiah said if thou certainli return in peac then hath

18 28 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up 
to ramothgilead 

18 29 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disgui 
myself and i will go to the battl but put thou on thi robe so the 
king of israel disgui himself and they went to the battl 

18 30 now the king of syria had command the captain of the chariot 
that were with him say fight ye not with small or great save 
onli with the king of israel

them that hate the lord therefor is wrath upon thee from befor the 
lord 

19 3 nevertheless there are good thing found in thee in that thou 
hast taken away the grove out of the land and hast prepar thine 
heart to seek god 

19 4 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through 
the peopl from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto 
the lord god of their father 

19 5 and he set judg in the land throughout all the fenc citi of 
judah citi by citi 19 6 and said to the judg take heed what ye 
do for ye judg not for man but for the lord who is with you in the 
judgment 

19 7 wherefor now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and 
do it for there is no iniqu with the lord our god nor respect of

19 8 moreov in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levit and of

and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi 

20 3 and jehoshaphat fear and set himself to seek the lord and 
proclaim a fast throughout all judah 

20 4 and judah gather themselv togeth to ask help of the lord 
even out of all the citi of judah they came to seek the lord 

20 5 and jehoshaphat stood in the congreg of judah and jerusalem 
in the hou of the lord befor the new court 20 6 and said o lord 
god of our father art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou

20 11 behold i say how they reward u to come to cast u out of thi

20 12 o our god wilt thou not judg them for we have no might

20 13 and all judah stood befor the lord with their littl one 
their wife and their child 

20 14 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the 
son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levit of the son of asaph 
came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congreg 20 15 
and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabit of jerusalem

for the lord will be with you 

20 18 and jehoshaphat bow hi head with hi face to the ground and

worship the lord 

20 19 and the levit of the child of the kohathit and of the 
child of the korhit stood up to prai the lord god of israel 
with a loud voic on high 

20 20 and they rose earli in the morn and went forth into the 
wilder of tekoa and a they went forth jehoshaphat stood and 
said hear me o judah and ye inhabit of jerusalem believ in

went out befor the armi and to say prai the lord for hi merci 
endureth for ever 

20 22 and when they began to sing and to prai the lord set 
ambush against the child of ammon moab and mount seir which 
were come against judah and they were smitten 

20 23 for the child of ammon and moab stood up against the 
inhabit of mount seir utterli to slay and destroy them and when 
they had made an end of the inhabit of seir everi one help to 
destroy anoth 

20 24 and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilder 
they look unto the multitud and behold they were dead bodi 
fallen to the earth and none escap 

20 25 and when jehoshaphat and hi peopl came to take away the spoil 
of them they found among them in abund both rich with the dead 
bodi and preciou jewel which they strip off for themselv 
more than they could carri away and they were three day in gather

20 26 and on the fourth day they assembl themselv in the valley of 
berachah for there they bless the lord therefor the name of the 
same place wa call the valley of berachah unto thi day 

20 27 then they return everi man of judah and jerusalem and 
jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with 
joy for the lord had made them to rejoic over their enemi 

20 28 and they came to jerusalem with psalteri and harp and 
trumpet unto the hou of the lord 

20 29 and the fear of god wa on all the kingdom of those countri 
when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemi of 
israel 

20 30 so the realm of jehoshaphat wa quiet for hi god gave him rest 
round about 

20 31 and jehoshaphat reign over judah he wa thirti and five year 
old when he began to reign and he reign twenti and five year in

from it do that which wa right in the sight of the lord 

20 33 howbeit the high place were not taken away for a yet the 
peopl had not prepar their heart unto the god of their father 

20 34 now the rest of the act of jehoshaphat first and last behold 
they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is 
mention in the book of the king of israel 

20 35 and after thi did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with 
ahaziah king of israel who did veri wickedli 20 36 and he join 
himself with him to make ship to go to tarshish and they made the 
ship in eziongab 

20 37 then eliez the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesi against 
jehoshaphat say becau thou hast join thyself with ahaziah 
the lord hath broken thi work and the ship were broken that they 
were not abl to go to tarshish 

21 1 now jehoshaphat slept with hi father and wa buri with hi 
father in the citi of david and jehoram hi son reign in hi 
stead 

21 2 and he had brother the son of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel 
and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these

21 3 and their father gave them great gift of silver and of gold 
and of preciou thing with fenc citi in judah but the kingdom 
gave he to jehoram becau he wa the firstborn 

21 4 now when jehoram wa risen up to the kingdom of hi father he 
strengthen himself and slew all hi brother with the sword and 
diver also of the princ of israel 

21 5 jehoram wa thirti and two year old when he began to reign and 
he reign eight year in jerusalem 

21 6 and he walk in the way of the king of israel like a did the 
hou of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought 
that which wa evil in the eye of the lord 

21 7 howbeit the lord would not destroy the hou of david becau of 
the coven that he had made with david and a he promi to give a 
light to him and to hi son for ever 

21 8 in hi day the edomit revolt from under the dominion of 
judah and made themselv a king 

21 9 then jehoram went forth with hi princ and all hi chariot 
with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomit which 
compass him in and the captain of the chariot 

21 10 so the edomit revolt from under the hand of judah unto thi 
day 

the same time also did libnah revolt from under hi hand becau he 
had forsaken the lord god of hi father 

21 11 moreov he made high place in the mountain of judah and 
cau the inhabit of jerusalem to commit fornic and 
compel judah thereto 

21 12 and there came a write to him from elijah the prophet say 
thu saith the lord god of david thi father becau thou hast not 
walk in the way of jehoshaphat thi father nor in the way of asa 
king of judah 21 13 but hast walk in the way of the king of

whore like to the whoredom of the hou of ahab and also hast 
slain thi brother of thi father s hou which were better than

peopl and thi child and thi wife and all thi good 21 15 and 
thou shalt have great sick by disea of thi bowel until thi 
bowel fall out by reason of the sick day by day 

21 16 moreov the lord stir up against jehoram the spirit of the 
philistin and of the arabian that were near the ethiopian 21 17 
and they came up into judah and brake into it and carri away all 
the substanc that wa found in the king s hou and hi son also 
and hi wife so that there wa never a son left him save jehoahaz 
the youngest of hi son 

21 18 and after all thi the lord smote him in hi bowel with an 
incur disea 

21 19 and it came to pa that in process of time after the end of 
two year hi bowel fell out by reason of hi sick so he die 
of sore disea and hi peopl made no burn for him like the 
burn of hi father 

21 20 thirti and two year old wa he when he began to reign and he 
reign in jerusalem eight year and depart without be desir 
howbeit they buri him in the citi of david but not in the 
sepulchr of the king 

22 1 and the inhabit of jerusalem made ahaziah hi youngest son 
king in hi stead for the band of men that came with the arabian to 
the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king 
of judah reign 

22 2 forti and two year old wa ahaziah when he began to reign and 
he reign one year in jerusalem hi mother s name also wa athaliah 
the daughter of omri 

22 3 he also walk in the way of the hou of ahab for hi mother

22 4 wherefor he did evil in the sight of the lord like the hou of 
ahab for they were hi counsellor after the death of hi father to 
hi destruct 

22 5 he walk also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son 
of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at 
ramothgilead and the syrian smote joram 

22 6 and he return to be heal in jezreel becau of the wound 
which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of

jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel becau he wa sick 

22 7 and the destruct of ahaziah wa of god by come to joram for 
when he wa come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of 
nimshi whom the lord had anoint to cut off the hou of ahab 

22 8 and it came to pa that when jehu wa execut judgment upon 
the hou of ahab and found the princ of judah and the son of the 
brother of ahaziah that minist to ahaziah he slew them 

22 9 and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he wa hid in 
samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they 
buri him becau said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who 
sought the lord with all hi heart so the hou of ahaziah had no 
power to keep still the kingdom 

22 10 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son wa 
dead she aro and destroy all the seed royal of the hou of 
judah 

22 11 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son 
of ahaziah and stole him from among the king s son that were slain 
and put him and hi nur in a bedchamb so jehoshabeath the 
daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she 
wa the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew 
him not 

22 12 and he wa with them hid in the hou of god six year and 
athaliah reign over the land 

23 1 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthen himself and took 
the captain of hundr azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the 
son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obe and maaseiah the son of 
adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into coven with him 

23 2 and they went about in judah and gather the levit out of all 
the citi of judah and the chief of the father of israel and they 
came to jerusalem 

23 3 and all the congreg made a coven with the king in the 
hou of god and he said unto them behold the king s son shall 
reign a the lord hath said of the son of david 

23 4 thi is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you enter 
on the sabbath of the priest and of the levit shall be porter of

23 6 but let none come into the hou of the lord save the priest 
and they that minist of the levit they shall go in for they are

23 7 and the levit shall compass the king round about everi man 
with hi weapon in hi hand and whosoev el cometh into the 
hou he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he 
cometh in and when he goeth out 

23 8 so the levit and all judah did accord to all thing that 
jehoiada the priest had command and took everi man hi men that 
were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the 
sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismiss not the cour 

23 9 moreov jehoiada the priest deliv to the captain of

23 10 and he set all the peopl everi man have hi weapon in hi 
hand from the right side of the templ to the left side of the 
templ along by the altar and the templ by the king round about 

23 11 then they brought out the king s son and put upon him the 
crown and gave him the testimoni and made him king and jehoiada and 
hi son anoint him and said god save the king 

23 12 now when athaliah heard the noi of the peopl run and 
prai the king she came to the peopl into the hou of the lord 
23 13 and she look and behold the king stood at hi pillar at the 
enter in and the princ and the trumpet by the king and all the

that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the 
rang and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for 
the priest said slay her not in the hou of the lord 

23 15 so they laid hand on her and when she wa come to the enter 
of the hor gate by the king s hou they slew her there 

23 16 and jehoiada made a coven between him and between all the 
peopl and between the king that they should be the lord s peopl 

23 17 then all the peopl went to the hou of baal and brake it 
down and brake hi altar and hi imag in piec and slew mattan

23 18 also jehoiada appoint the offic of the hou of the lord by

23 19 and he set the porter at the gate of the hou of the lord 
that none which wa unclean in ani thing should enter in 

23 20 and he took the captain of hundr and the nobl and the 
governor of the peopl and all the peopl of the land and brought 
down the king from the hou of the lord and they came through the 
high gate into the king s hou and set the king upon the throne of 
the kingdom 

23 21 and all the peopl of the land rejoic and the citi wa quiet 
after that they had slain athaliah with the sword 

24 1 joash wa seven year old when he began to reign and he reign 
forti year in jerusalem hi mother s name also wa zibiah of 
beersheba 

24 2 and joash did that which wa right in the sight of the lord all 
the day of jehoiada the priest 

24 3 and jehoiada took for him two wife and he begat son and 
daughter 

24 4 and it came to pa after thi that joash wa mind to repair 
the hou of the lord 

24 5 and he gather togeth the priest and the levit and said to 
them go out unto the citi of judah and gather of all israel money 
to repair the hou of your god from year to year and see that ye

24 6 and the king call for jehoiada the chief and said unto him 
whi hast thou not requir of the levit to bring in out of judah and 
out of jerusalem the collect accord to the command of mose 
the servant of the lord and of the congreg of israel for the 
tabernacl of wit 24 7 for the son of athaliah that wick 
woman had broken up the hou of god and also all the dedic 
thing of the hou of the lord did they bestow upon baalim 

24 8 and at the king s command they made a chest and set it 
without at the gate of the hou of the lord 

24 9 and they made a proclam through judah and jerusalem to 
bring in to the lord the collect that mose the servant of god laid 
upon israel in the wilder 

24 10 and all the princ and all the peopl rejoic and brought in 
and cast into the chest until they had made an end 

24 11 now it came to pa that at what time the chest wa brought 
unto the king s offic by the hand of the levit and when they saw 
that there wa much money the king s scribe and the high priest s 
offic came and empti the chest and took it and carri it to hi

24 12 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such a did the work of the 
servic of the hou of the lord and hire mason and carpent to 
repair the hou of the lord and also such a wrought iron and brass 
to mend the hou of the lord 

24 13 so the workman wrought and the work wa perfect by them and 
they set the hou of god in hi state and strengthen it 

24 14 and when they had finish it they brought the rest of the 
money befor the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessel for the 
hou of the lord even vessel to minist and to offer withal and 
spoon and vessel of gold and silver and they offer burnt

24 15 but jehoiada wax old and wa full of day when he die an 
hundr and thirti year old wa he when he die 

24 16 and they buri him in the citi of david among the king 
becau he had done good in israel both toward god and toward hi 
hou 

24 17 now after the death of jehoiada came the princ of judah and 
made obei to the king then the king hearken unto them 

24 18 and they left the hou of the lord god of their father and 
serv grove and idol and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for 
thi their trespass 

24 19 yet he sent prophet to them to bring them again unto the lord 
and they testifi against them but they would not give ear 

24 20 and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada 
the priest which stood abov the peopl and said unto them thu 
saith god whi transgress ye the command of the lord that ye 
cannot prosper becau ye have forsaken the lord he hath also 
forsaken you 

24 21 and they conspir against him and stone him with stone at 
the command of the king in the court of the hou of the lord 

24 22 thu joash the king rememb not the kind which jehoiada 
hi father had done to him but slew hi son and when he die he 
said the lord look upon it and requir it 

24 23 and it came to pa at the end of the year that the host of 
syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and 
destroy all the princ of the peopl from among the peopl and 
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascu 

24 24 for the armi of the syrian came with a small compani of men 
and the lord deliv a veri great host into their hand becau they 
had forsaken the lord god of their father so they execut judgment 
against joash 

24 25 and when they were depart from him for they left him in 
great disea hi own servant conspir against him for the blood 
of the son of jehoiada the priest and slew him on hi bed and he 
die and they buri him in the citi of david but they buri him 
not in the sepulchr of the king 

24 26 and these are they that conspir against him zabad the son of 
shimeath an ammonit and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess 

24 27 now concern hi son and the great of the burden laid 
upon him and the repair of the hou of god behold they are 
written in the stori of the book of the king and amaziah hi son 
reign in hi stead 

25 1 amaziah wa twenti and five year old when he began to reign and 
he reign twenti and nine year in jerusalem and hi mother s name 
wa jehoaddan of jerusalem 

25 2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord but not 
with a perfect heart 

25 3 now it came to pa when the kingdom wa establish to him 
that he slew hi servant that had kill the king hi father 

25 4 but he slew not their child but did a it is written in the 
law in the book of mose where the lord command say the 
father shall not die for the child neither shall the child die 
for the father but everi man shall die for hi own sin 

25 5 moreov amaziah gather judah togeth and made them captain 
over thousand and captain over hundr accord to the hou of 
their father throughout all judah and benjamin and he number them 
from twenti year old and abov and found them three hundr thousand 
choic men abl to go forth to war that could handl spear and 
shield 

25 6 he hire also an hundr thousand mighti men of valour out of 
israel for an hundr talent of silver 

25 7 but there came a man of god to him say o king let not the 
armi of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit 
with all the child of ephraim 

25 8 but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battl god shall 
make thee fall befor the enemi for god hath power to help and to 
cast down 

25 9 and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the 
hundr talent which i have given to the armi of israel and the man 
of god answer the lord is abl to give thee much more than thi 

25 10 then amaziah separ them to wit the armi that wa come to 
him out of ephraim to go home again wherefor their anger wa 
greatli kindl against judah and they return home in great anger 

25 11 and amaziah strengthen himself and led forth hi peopl and 
went to the valley of salt and smote of the child of seir ten 
thousand 

25 12 and other ten thousand left aliv did the child of judah 
carri away captiv and brought them unto the top of the rock and 
cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in 
piec 

25 13 but the soldier of the armi which amaziah sent back that they 
should not go with him to battl fell upon the citi of judah from 
samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and 
took much spoil 

25 14 now it came to pa after that amaziah wa come from the 
slaughter of the edomit that he brought the god of the child of 
seir and set them up to be hi god and bow down himself befor 
them and burn incen unto them 

25 15 wherefor the anger of the lord wa kindl against amaziah and 
he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him whi hast thou sought 
after the god of the peopl which could not deliv their own peopl 
out of thine hand 25 16 and it came to pa a he talk with him 
that the king said unto him art thou made of the king s counsel 
forbear whi shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbar and 
said i know that god hath determin to destroy thee becau thou 
hast done thi and hast not hearken unto my counsel 

25 17 then amaziah king of judah took advic and sent to joash the 
son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel say come let u 
see one anoth in the face 

25 18 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah say

say give thi daughter to my son to wife and there pa by a 
wild beast that wa in lebanon and trode down the thistl 

25 19 thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomit and thine heart 
lifteth thee up to boast abid now at home whi shouldest thou meddl 
to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with 
thee 25 20 but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he 
might deliv them into the hand of their enemi becau they sought 
after the god of edom 

25 21 so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one anoth in 
the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which 
belongeth to judah 

25 22 and judah wa put to the wor befor israel and they fled 
everi man to hi tent 

25 23 and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son 
of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to 
jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of 
ephraim to the corner gate four hundr cubit

of the king s hou the hostag also and return to samaria 

25 25 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah live after the death 
of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen year

uzziah to burn incen unto the lord but to the priest the son of 
aaron that are consecr to burn incen go out of the sanctuari 
for thou hast trespass neither shall it be for thine honour from

rose up in hi forehead befor the priest in the hou of the lord 
from besid the incen altar 

26 20 and azariah the chief priest and all the priest look upon

26 23 so uzziah slept with hi father and they buri him with hi 
father in the field of the burial which belong to the king for

27 1 jotham wa twenti and five year old when he began to reign and

judah 

27 8 he wa five and twenti year old when he began to reign and 
reign sixteen year in jerusalem 

27 9 and jotham slept with hi father and they buri him in the 
citi of david and ahaz hi son reign in hi stead 

28 1 ahaz wa twenti year old when he began to reign and he reign 
sixteen year in jerusalem but he did not that which wa right in the 
sight of the lord like david hi father 28 2 for he walk in the 
way of the king of israel and made also molten imag for baalim 

28 3 moreov he burnt incen in the valley of the son of hinnom and 
burnt hi child in the fire after the abomin of the heathen 
whom the lord had cast out befor the child of israel 

28 4 he sacrif also and burnt incen in the high place and on 
the hill and under everi green tree 

28 5 wherefor the lord hi god deliv him into the hand of the 
king of syria and they smote him and carri away a great multitud 
of them captiv and brought them to damascu and he wa also 
deliv into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a 
great slaughter 

28 6 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundr and twenti 
thousand in one day which were all valiant men becau they had 
forsaken the lord god of their father 

28 7 and zichri a mighti man of ephraim slew maaseiah the king s 
son and azrikam the governor of the hou and elkanah that wa next 
to the king 

28 8 and the child of israel carri away captiv of their brother 
two hundr thousand woman son and daughter and took also away 
much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria 

28 9 but a prophet of the lord wa there whose name wa ode and he 
went out befor the host that came to samaria and said unto them 
behold becau the lord god of your father wa wroth with judah he 
hath deliv them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage 
that reacheth up unto heaven 

28 10 and now ye purpo to keep under the child of judah and 
jerusalem for bondman and bondwoman unto you but are there not with 
you even with you sin against the lord your god 28 11 now hear me 
therefor and deliv the captiv again which ye have taken captiv 
of your brother for the fierc wrath of the lord is upon you 

28 12 then certain of the head of the child of ephraim azariah 
the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah 
the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them 
that came from the war 28 13 and said unto them ye shall not bring 
in the captiv hither for wherea we have offend against the lord 
alreadi ye intend to add more to our sin and to our trespass for 
our trespass is great and there is fierc wrath against israel 

28 14 so the arm men left the captiv and the spoil befor the 
princ and all the congreg 

28 15 and the men which were express by name rose up and took the 
captiv and with the spoil cloth all that were nake among them 
and array them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink 
and anoint them and carri all the feebl of them upon as and 
brought them to jericho the citi of palm tree to their brother 
then they return to samaria 

28 16 at that time did king ahaz send unto the king of assyria to 
help him 

28 17 for again the edomit had come and smitten judah and carri 
away captiv 

28 18 the philistin also had invad the citi of the low countri 
and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and 
gederoth and shocho with the villag thereof and timnah with the 
villag thereof gimzo also and the villag thereof and they dwelt 
there 

28 19 for the lord brought judah low becau of ahaz king of israel 
for he made judah nake and transgress sore against the lord 

28 20 and tilgathpiln king of assyria came unto him and 
distress him but strengthen him not 

28 21 for ahaz took away a portion out of the hou of the lord and 
out of the hou of the king and of the princ and gave it unto the 
king of assyria but he help him not 

28 22 and in the time of hi distress did he trespass yet more against 
the lord thi is that king ahaz 

28 23 for he sacrif unto the god of damascu which smote him 
and he said becau the god of the king of syria help them 
therefor will i sacrif to them that they may help me but they 
were the ruin of him and of all israel 

28 24 and ahaz gather togeth the vessel of the hou of god and 
cut in piec the vessel of the hou of god and shut up the door 
of the hou of the lord and he made him altar in everi corner of 
jerusalem 

28 25 and in everi sever citi of judah he made high place to burn 
incen unto other god and provok to anger the lord god of hi 
father 

28 26 now the rest of hi act and of all hi way first and last 
behold they are written in the book of the king of judah and israel 

28 27 and ahaz slept with hi father and they buri him in the 
citi even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchr 
of the king of israel and hezekiah hi son reign in hi stead 

29 1 hezekiah began to reign when he wa five and twenti year old 
and he reign nine and twenti year in jerusalem and hi mother s 
name wa abijah the daughter of zechariah 

29 2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord 
accord to all that david hi father had done 

29 3 he in the first year of hi reign in the first month open the 
door of the hou of the lord and repair them 

29 4 and he brought in the priest and the levit and gather them 
togeth into the east street 29 5 and said unto them hear me ye 
levit sanctifi now yourselv and sanctifi the hou of the lord 
god of your father and carri forth the filthi out of the holi 
place 

29 6 for our father have trespass and done that which wa evil in 
the eye of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turn 
away their face from the habit of the lord and turn their 
back 

29 7 also they have shut up the door of the porch and put out the 
lamp and have not burn incen nor offer burnt offer in the 
holi place unto the god of israel 

29 8 wherefor the wrath of the lord wa upon judah and jerusalem and 
he hath deliv them to troubl to astonish and to hiss a 
ye see with your eye 

29 9 for lo our father have fallen by the sword and our son and 
our daughter and our wife are in captiv for thi 

29 10 now it is in mine heart to make a coven with the lord god of 
israel that hi fierc wrath may turn away from u 

29 11 my son be not now neglig for the lord hath chosen you to 
stand befor him to serv him and that ye should minist unto him 
and burn incen 

29 12 then the levit aro mahath the son of amasai and joel the 
son of azariah of the son of the kohathit and of the son of 
merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of 
the gershonit joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah 
29 13 and of the son of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the son 
of asaph zechariah and mattaniah 29 14 and of the son of heman 
jehiel and shimei and of the son of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel 

29 15 and they gather their brother and sanctifi themselv and 
came accord to the command of the king by the word of the 
lord to clean the hou of the lord 

29 16 and the priest went into the inner part of the hou of the 
lord to clean it and brought out all the unclean that they 
found in the templ of the lord into the court of the hou of the 
lord and the levit took it to carri it out abroad into the brook 
kidron 

29 17 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctifi 
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord 
so they sanctifi the hou of the lord in eight day and in the 
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end 

29 18 then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have 
clean all the hou of the lord and the altar of burnt offer 
with all the vessel thereof and the shewbread tabl with all the 
vessel thereof 

29 19 moreov all the vessel which king ahaz in hi reign did cast 
away in hi transgress have we prepar and sanctifi and 
behold they are befor the altar of the lord 

29 20 then hezekiah the king rose earli and gather the ruler of 
the citi and went up to the hou of the lord 

29 21 and they brought seven bullock and seven ram and seven 
lamb and seven he goat for a sin offer for the kingdom and for 
the sanctuari and for judah and he command the priest the son of 
aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord 

29 22 so they kill the bullock and the priest receiv the blood 
and sprinkl it on the altar likewi when they had kill the 
ram they sprinkl the blood upon the altar they kill also the 
lamb and they sprinkl the blood upon the altar 

29 23 and they brought forth the he goat for the sin offer befor 
the king and the congreg and they laid their hand upon them 
29 24 and the priest kill them and they made reconcili with 
their blood upon the altar to make an aton for all israel for 
the king command that the burnt offer and the sin offer should 
be made for all israel 

29 25 and he set the levit in the hou of the lord with cymbal 
with psalteri and with harp accord to the command of 
david and of gad the king s seer and nathan the prophet for so wa 
the command of the lord by hi prophet 

29 26 and the levit stood with the instrument of david and the 
priest with the trumpet 

29 27 and hezekiah command to offer the burnt offer upon the 
altar 

and when the burnt offer began the song of the lord began also 
with the trumpet and with the instrument ordain by david king of 
israel 

29 28 and all the congreg worship and the singer sang and 
the trumpet sound and all thi continu until the burnt 
offer wa finish 

29 29 and when they had made an end of offer the king and all that 
were present with him bow themselv and worship 

29 30 moreov hezekiah the king and the princ command the levit 
to sing prai unto the lord with the word of david and of asaph the 
seer and they sang prai with glad and they bow their head 
and worship 

29 31 then hezekiah answer and said now ye have consecr 
yourselv unto the lord come near and bring sacrif and thank 
offer into the hou of the lord and the congreg brought in 
sacrif and thank offer and a mani a were of a free heart 
burnt offer 

29 32 and the number of the burnt offer which the congreg 
brought wa threescor and ten bullock an hundr ram and two 
hundr lamb all these were for a burnt offer to the lord 

29 33 and the consecr thing were six hundr ox and three 
thousand sheep 

29 34 but the priest were too few so that they could not flay all 
the burnt offer wherefor their brother the levit did help 
them till the work wa end and until the other priest had 
sanctifi themselv for the levit were more upright in heart to 
sanctifi themselv than the priest 

29 35 and also the burnt offer were in abund with the fat of 
the peac offer and the drink offer for everi burnt offer 
so the servic of the hou of the lord wa set in order 

29 36 and hezekiah rejoic and all the peopl that god had prepar 
the peopl for the thing wa done suddenli 

30 1 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letter also 
to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the hou of the 
lord at jerusalem to keep the passov unto the lord god of israel 

30 2 for the king had taken counsel and hi princ and all the 
congreg in jerusalem to keep the passov in the second month 

30 3 for they could not keep it at that time becau the priest had 
not sanctifi themselv suffici neither had the peopl 
gather themselv togeth to jerusalem 

30 4 and the thing plea the king and all the congreg 

30 5 so they establish a decr to make proclam throughout all 
israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the 
passov unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not 
done it of a long time in such sort a it wa written 

30 6 so the post went with the letter from the king and hi princ 
throughout all israel and judah and accord to the command of 
the king say ye child of israel turn again unto the lord god 
of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of

30 7 and be not ye like your father and like your brother which 
trespass against the lord god of their father who therefor gave 
them up to desol a ye see 

30 8 now be ye not stiffneck a your father were but yield 
yourselv unto the lord and enter into hi sanctuari which he hath 
sanctifi for ever and serv the lord your god that the fierc 
of hi wrath may turn away from you 

30 9 for if ye turn again unto the lord your brother and your 
child shall find compass befor them that lead them captiv so 
that they shall come again into thi land for the lord your god is 
graciou and merci and will not turn away hi face from you if ye 
return unto him 

30 10 so the post pa from citi to citi through the countri of 
ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laugh them to 
scorn and mock them 

30 11 nevertheless diver of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbl

hou of the lord 

30 16 and they stood in their place after their manner accord to 
the law of mose the man of god the priest sprinkl the blood 
which they receiv of the hand of the levit 

30 17 for there were mani in the congreg that were not

passov for everi one that wa not clean to sanctifi them unto the 
lord 

30 18 for a multitud of the peopl even mani of ephraim and

seven day offer peac offer and make confess to the 
lord god of their father 

30 23 and the whole assembl took counsel to keep other seven day 
and they kept other seven day with glad 

30 24 for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congreg a 
thousand bullock and seven thousand sheep and the princ gave to 
the congreg a thousand bullock and ten thousand sheep and a 
great number of priest sanctifi themselv 

30 25 and all the congreg of judah with the priest and the

all nation from thenceforth 

32 24 in those day hezekiah wa sick to the death and pray unto 
the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign 

32 25 but hezekiah render not again accord to the benefit done 
unto him for hi heart wa lift up therefor there wa wrath upon 
him and upon judah and jerusalem 

32 26 notwithstand hezekiah humbl himself for the pride of hi 
heart both he and the inhabit of jerusalem so that the wrath of 
the lord came not upon them in the day of hezekiah 

32 27 and hezekiah had exceed much rich and honour and he made 
himself treasuri for silver and for gold and for preciou stone 
and for spice and for shield and for all manner of pleasant 
jewel 32 28 storeh also for the increa of corn and wine and 
oil and stall for all manner of beast and cote for flock 

32 29 moreov he provid him citi and poss of flock and 
herd in abund for god had given him substanc veri much 

32 30 thi same hezekiah also stop the upper watercour of gihon 
and brought it straight down to the west side of the citi of david 
and hezekiah prosper in all hi work 

32 31 howbeit in the busi of the ambassador of the princ of 
babylon who sent unto him to enquir of the wonder that wa done in 
the land god left him to tri him that he might know all that wa in 
hi heart 

32 32 now the rest of the act of hezekiah and hi good behold 
they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 
and in the book of the king of judah and israel 

32 33 and hezekiah slept with hi father and they buri him in the 
chiefest of the sepulchr of the son of david and all judah and the 
inhabit of jerusalem did him honour at hi death and manasseh hi 
son reign in hi stead 

33 1 manasseh wa twelv year old when he began to reign and he 
reign fifti and five year in jerusalem 33 2 but did that which wa 
evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abomin of the 
heathen whom the lord had cast out befor the child of israel 

33 3 for he built again the high place which hezekiah hi father had 
broken down and he rear up altar for baalim and made grove and 
worship all the host of heaven and serv them 

33 4 also he built altar in the hou of the lord whereof the lord 
had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever 

33 5 and he built altar for all the host of heaven in the two court 
of the hou of the lord 

33 6 and he cau hi child to pa through the fire in the valley 
of the son of hinnom also he observ time and use enchant 
and use witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with 
wizard he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provok him 
to anger 

33 7 and he set a carv imag the idol which he had made in the 
hou of god of which god had said to david and to solomon hi son 
in thi hou and in jerusalem which i have chosen befor all the 
tribe of israel will i put my name for ever 33 8 neither will i ani 
more remov the foot of israel from out of the land which i have 
appoint for your father so that they will take heed to do all that 
i have command them accord to the whole law and the statut and 
the ordin by the hand of mose 

33 9 so manasseh made judah and the inhabit of jerusalem to err 
and to do wor than the heathen whom the lord had destroy befor 
the child of israel 

33 10 and the lord spake to manasseh and to hi peopl but they 
would not hearken 

33 11 wherefor the lord brought upon them the captain of the host of 
the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorn and bound 
him with fetter and carri him to babylon 

33 12 and when he wa in afflict he besought the lord hi god and 
humbl himself greatli befor the god of hi father 33 13 and 
pray unto him and he wa intreat of him and heard hi 
supplic and brought him again to jerusalem into hi kingdom 
then manasseh knew that the lord he wa god 

33 14 now after thi he built a wall without the citi of david on the 
west side of gihon in the valley even to the enter in at the fish 
gate and compass about ophel and rai it up a veri great height 
and put captain of war in all the fenc citi of judah 

33 15 and he took away the strang god and the idol out of the hou 
of the lord and all the altar that he had built in the mount of the 
hou of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the citi 

33 16 and he repair the altar of the lord and sacrif thereon 
peac offer and thank offer and command judah to serv the 
lord god of israel 

33 17 nevertheless the peopl did sacrif still in the high place 
yet unto the lord their god onli 

33 18 now the rest of the act of manasseh and hi prayer unto hi 
god and the word of the seer that spake to him in the name of the 
lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the king 
of israel 

33 19 hi prayer also and how god wa intreat of him and all hi 
sin and hi trespass and the place wherein he built high place 
and set up grove and graven imag befor he wa humbl behold 
they are written among the say of the seer 

33 20 so manasseh slept with hi father and they buri him in hi 
own hou and amon hi son reign in hi stead 

33 21 amon wa two and twenti year old when he began to reign and 
reign two year in jerusalem 

33 22 but he did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord a did 
manasseh hi father for amon sacrif unto all the carv imag 
which manasseh hi father had made and serv them 33 23 and humbl 
not himself befor the lord a manasseh hi father had humbl 
himself but amon trespass more and more 

33 24 and hi servant conspir against him and slew him in hi own 
hou 

33 25 but the peopl of the land slew all them that had conspir 
against king amon and the peopl of the land made josiah hi son king 
in hi stead 

34 1 josiah wa eight year old when he began to reign and he reign 
in jerusalem one and thirti year 

34 2 and he did that which wa right in the sight of the lord and 
walk in the way of david hi father and declin neither to the 
right hand nor to the left 

34 3 for in the eighth year of hi reign while he wa yet young he 
began to seek after the god of david hi father and in the twelfth 
year he began to purg judah and jerusalem from the high place and 
the grove and the carv imag and the molten imag 

34 4 and they brake down the altar of baalim in hi presenc and the 
imag that were on high abov them he cut down and the grove and 
the carv imag and the molten imag he brake in piec and made 
dust of them and strow it upon the graf of them that had 
sacrif unto them 

34 5 and he burnt the bone of the priest upon their altar and 
clean judah and jerusalem 

34 6 and so did he in the citi of manasseh and ephraim and simeon 
even unto naphtali with their mattock round about 

34 7 and when he had broken down the altar and the grove and had 
beaten the graven imag into powder and cut down all the idol 
throughout all the land of israel he return to jerusalem 

34 8 now in the eighteenth year of hi reign when he had purg the 
land and the hou he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah 
the governor of the citi and joah the son of joahaz the record to 
repair the hou of the lord hi god 

34 9 and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they deliv the 
money that wa brought into the hou of god which the levit that 
kept the door had gather of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and 
of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they 
return to jerusalem 

34 10 and they put it in the hand of the workman that had the 
oversight of the hou of the lord and they gave it to the workman 
that wrought in the hou of the lord to repair and amend the hou 
34 11 even to the artif and builder gave they it to buy hewn 
stone and timber for coupl and to floor the hou which the 
king of judah had destroy 

34 12 and the men did the work faith and the over of them 
were jahath and obadiah the levit of the son of merari and 
zechariah and meshullam of the son of the kohathit to set it 
forward and other of the levit all that could skill of instrument 
of musick 

34 13 also they were over the bearer of burden and were over 
of all that wrought the work in ani manner of servic and of the 
levit there were scribe and offic and porter 

34 14 and when they brought out the money that wa brought into the 
hou of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the 
lord given by mose 

34 15 and hilkiah answer and said to shaphan the scribe i have 
found the book of the law in the hou of the lord and hilkiah 
deliv the book to shaphan 

34 16 and shaphan carri the book to the king and brought the king 
word back again say all that wa commit to thi servant they 
do it 

34 17 and they have gather togeth the money that wa found in the 
hou of the lord and have deliv it into the hand of the 
over and to the hand of the workman 

34 18 then shaphan the scribe told the king say hilkiah the 
priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it befor the king 

34 19 and it came to pa when the king had heard the word of the 
law that he rent hi cloth 

34 20 and the king command hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan 
and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a 
servant of the king s say 34 21 go enquir of the lord for me 
and for them that are left in israel and in judah concern the 
word of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord 
that is pour out upon u becau our father have not kept the word 
of the lord to do after all that is written in thi book 

34 22 and hilkiah and they that the king had appoint went to 
huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son 
of hasrah keeper of the wardrob now she dwelt in jerusalem in the 
colleg and they spake to her to that effect 

34 23 and she answer them thu saith the lord god of israel tell 
ye the man that sent you to me 34 24 thu saith the lord behold i 
will bring evil upon thi place and upon the inhabit thereof 
even all the cur that are written in the book which they have read 
befor the king of judah 34 25 becau they have forsaken me and 
have burn incen unto other god that they might provok me to 
anger with all the work of their hand therefor my wrath shall be 
pour out upon thi place and shall not be quench 

34 26 and a for the king of judah who sent you to enquir of the 
lord so shall ye say unto him thu saith the lord god of israel 
concern the word which thou hast heard 34 27 becau thine heart 
wa tender and thou didst humbl thyself befor god when thou 
heardest hi word against thi place and against the inhabit 
thereof and humbledst thyself befor me and didst rend thi cloth 
and weep befor me i have even heard thee also saith the lord 

34 28 behold i will gather thee to thi father and thou shalt be 
gather to thi grave in peac neither shall thine eye see all the 
evil that i will bring upon thi place and upon the inhabit of 
the same so they brought the king word again 

34 29 then the king sent and gather togeth all the elder of judah 
and jerusalem 

34 30 and the king went up into the hou of the lord and all the men 
of judah and the inhabit of jerusalem and the priest and the 
levit and all the peopl great and small and he read in their 
ear all the word of the book of the coven that wa found in the 
hou of the lord 

34 31 and the king stood in hi place and made a coven befor the 
lord to walk after the lord and to keep hi command and hi 
testimoni and hi statut with all hi heart and with all hi 
soul to perform the word of the coven which are written in thi 
book 

34 32 and he cau all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to 
stand to it and the inhabit of jerusalem did accord to the 
coven of god the god of their father 

34 33 and josiah took away all the abomin out of all the 
countri that pertain to the child of israel and made all that 
were present in israel to serv even to serv the lord their god and 
all hi day they depart not from follow the lord the god of 
their father 

35 1 moreov josiah kept a passov unto the lord in jerusalem and 
they kill the passov on the fourteenth day of the first month 

35 2 and he set the priest in their charg and encourag them to 
the servic of the hou of the lord 35 3 and said unto the levit 
that taught all israel which were holi unto the lord put the holi 
ark in the hou which solomon the son of david king of israel did 
build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulder serv now the 
lord your god and hi peopl israel 35 4 and prepar yourselv by

35 5 and stand in the holi place accord to the divi of the 
famili of the father of your brother the peopl and after the 
divi of the famili of the levit 

35 6 so kill the passov and sanctifi yourselv and prepar your 
brother that they may do accord to the word of the lord by the 
hand of mose 

35 7 and josiah gave to the peopl of the flock lamb and kid all 
for the passov offer for all that were present to the number 
of thirti thousand and three thousand bullock these were of the 
king s substanc 

35 8 and hi princ gave willingli unto the peopl to the priest

hou of god gave unto the priest for the passov offer two 
thousand and six hundr small cattl and three hundr ox

hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levit gave unto the 
levit for passov offer five thousand small cattl and five 
hundr ox 

35 10 so the servic wa prepar and the priest stood in their 
place and the levit in their cour accord to the king s 
command 

35 11 and they kill the passov and the priest sprinkl the 
blood from their hand and the levit flay them 

35 12 and they remov the burnt offer that they might give 
accord to the divi of the famili of the peopl to offer 
unto the lord a it is written in the book of mose and so did they 
with the ox 

35 13 and they roast the passov with fire accord to the 
ordin but the other holi offer sod they in pot and in 
caldron and in pan and divid them speedili among all the peopl 

35 14 and afterward they made readi for themselv and for the 
priest becau the priest the son of aaron were busi in offer 
of burnt offer and the fat until night therefor the levit 
prepar for themselv and for the priest the son of aaron 

35 15 and the singer the son of asaph were in their place accord 
to the command of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the 
king s seer and the porter wait at everi gate they might not 
depart from their servic for their brother the levit prepar for 
them 

35 16 so all the servic of the lord wa prepar the same day to 
keep the passov and to offer burnt offer upon the altar of the 
lord accord to the command of king josiah 

35 17 and the child of israel that were present kept the passov 
at that time and the feast of unleaven bread seven day 

35 18 and there wa no passov like to that kept in israel from the 
day of samuel the prophet neither did all the king of israel keep 
such a passov a josiah kept and the priest and the levit and 
all judah and israel that were present and the inhabit of 
jerusalem 

35 19 in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah wa thi passov 
kept 

35 20 after all thi when josiah had prepar the templ necho king 
of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrat and josiah 
went out against him 

35 21 but he sent ambassador to him say what have i to do with 
thee thou king of judah i come not against thee thi day but 
against the hou wherewith i have war for god command me to make 
hast forbear thee from meddl with god who is with me that he 
destroy thee not 

35 22 nevertheless josiah would not turn hi face from him but 
disgui himself that he might fight with him and hearken not 
unto the word of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in 
the valley of megiddo 

35 23 and the archer shot at king josiah and the king said to hi 
servant have me away for i am sore wound 

35 24 hi servant therefor took him out of that chariot and put him 
in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem 
and he die and wa buri in one of the sepulchr of hi father 
and all judah and jerusalem mourn for josiah 

35 25 and jeremiah lament for josiah and all the sing men and 
the sing woman spake of josiah in their lament to thi day 
and made them an ordin in israel and behold they are written in 
the lament 

35 26 now the rest of the act of josiah and hi good accord 
to that which wa written in the law of the lord 35 27 and hi deed 
first and last behold they are written in the book of the king of 
israel and judah 

36 1 then the peopl of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and 
made him king in hi father s stead in jerusalem 

36 2 jehoahaz wa twenti and three year old when he began to reign 
and he reign three month in jerusalem 

36 3 and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemn 
the land in an hundr talent of silver and a talent of gold 

36 4 and the king of egypt made eliakim hi brother king over judah 
and jerusalem and turn hi name to jehoiakim and necho took 
jehoahaz hi brother and carri him to egypt 

36 5 jehoiakim wa twenti and five year old when he began to reign 
and he reign eleven year in jerusalem and he did that which wa 
evil in the sight of the lord hi god

in fetter to carri him to babylon 

36 7 nebuchadnezzar also carri of the vessel of the hou of the 
lord to babylon and put them in hi templ at babylon 

36 8 now the rest of the act of jehoiakim and hi abomin which 
he did and that which wa found in him behold they are written in 
the book of the king of israel and judah and jehoiachin hi son 
reign in hi stead 

36 9 jehoiachin wa eight year old when he began to reign and he

36 12 and he did that which wa evil in the sight of the lord hi god 
and humbl not himself befor jeremiah the prophet speak from the 
mouth of the lord 

36 13 and he also rebel against king nebuchadnezzar who had made 
him swear by god but he stiffen hi neck and harden hi heart 
from turn unto the lord god of israel 

36 14 moreov all the chief of the priest and the peopl 
transgress veri much after all the abomin of the heathen and 
pollut the hou of the lord which he had hallow in jerusalem 

36 15 and the lord god of their father sent to them by hi 
messeng rise up betim and send becau he had compass

messeng of god and despi hi word and misu hi prophet

36 17 therefor he brought upon them the king of the chald who 
slew their young men with the sword in the hou of their sanctuari 
and had no compass upon young man or maiden old man or him that 
stoop for age he gave them all into hi hand 

36 18 and all the vessel of the hou of god great and small and 
the treasur of the hou of the lord and the treasur of the king 
and of hi princ all these he brought to babylon 

36 19 and they burnt the hou of god and brake down the wall of 
jerusalem and burnt all the palac thereof with fire and destroy

of the kingdom of persia 36 21 to fulfil the word of the lord by the 
mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoy her sabbath for a

tobiah the ammonit wa by him and he said even that which they

4 4 hear o our god for we are despi and turn their reproach upon 
their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captiv 4 5 
and cover not their iniqu and let not their sin be blot out 
from befor thee for they have provok thee to anger befor the 
builder 

4 6 so built we the wall and all the wall wa join togeth unto 
the half thereof for the peopl had a mind to work 

4 7 but it came to pa that when sanballat and tobiah and the 
arabian and the ammonit and the ashdodit heard that the wall 
of jerusalem were made up and that the breach began to be stop 
then they were veri wroth 4 8 and conspir all of them togeth to 
come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it 

4 9 nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch 
against them day and night becau of them 

4 10 and judah said the strength of the bearer of burden is 
decay and there is much rubbish so that we are not abl to build 
the wall 

4 11 and our adversari said they shall not know neither see till 
we come in the midst among them and slay them and cau the work to 
cea 

4 12 and it came to pa that when the jew which dwelt by them came 
they said unto u ten time from all place whenc ye shall return 
unto u they will be upon you 

4 13 therefor set i in the lower place behind the wall and on the 
higher place i even set the peopl after their famili with their 
sword their spear and their bow 

4 14 and i look and rose up and said unto the nobl and to the 
ruler and to the rest of the peopl be not ye afraid of them 
rememb the lord which is great and terribl and fight for your 
brother your son and your daughter your wife and your hou 

4 15 and it came to pa when our enemi heard that it wa known 
unto u and god had brought their counsel to nought that we return 
all of u to the wall everi one unto hi work 

4 16 and it came to pa from that time forth that the half of my 
servant wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the 
spear the shield and the bow and the habergeon and the ruler 
were behind all the hou of judah 

4 17 they which build on the wall and they that bare burden with 
those that lade everi one with one of hi hand wrought in the work 
and with the other hand held a weapon 

4 18 for the builder everi one had hi sword gird by hi side and 
so build and he that sound the trumpet wa by me 

4 19 and i said unto the nobl and to the ruler and to the rest of 
the peopl the work is great and larg and we are separ upon the 
wall one far from anoth 

4 20 in what place therefor ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort 
ye thither unto u our god shall fight for u 

4 21 so we labour in the work and half of them held the spear from 
the rise of the morn till the star appear 

4 22 likewi at the same time said i unto the peopl let everi one 
with hi servant lodg within jerusalem that in the night they may be 
a guard to u and labour on the day 

4 23 so neither i nor my brother nor my servant nor the men of 
the guard which follow me none of u put off our cloth save 
that everi one put them off for wash 

5 1 and there wa a great cri of the peopl and of their wife against 
their brother the jew 

5 2 for there were that said we our son and our daughter are 
mani therefor we take up corn for them that we may eat and live 

5 3 some also there were that said we have mortgag our land 
vineyard and hou that we might buy corn becau of the dearth 

5 4 there were also that said we have borrow money for the king s 
tribut and that upon our land and vineyard 

5 5 yet now our flesh is a the flesh of our brother our child a 
their child and lo we bring into bondag our son and our 
daughter to be servant and some of our daughter are brought unto 
bondag alreadi neither is it in our power to redeem them for other 
men have our land and vineyard 

5 6 and i wa veri angri when i heard their cri and these word 

5 7 then i consult with myself and i rebuk the nobl and the 
ruler and said unto them ye exact usuri everi one of hi brother 
and i set a great assembl against them 

5 8 and i said unto them we after our abil have redeem our 
brother the jew which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even 
sell your brother or shall they be sold unto u then held they 
their peac and found noth to answer 

5 9 also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in 
the fear of our god becau of the reproach of the heathen our 
enemi 5 10 i likewi and my brother and my servant might 
exact of them money and corn i pray you let u leav off thi usuri 

5 11 restor i pray you to them even thi day their land their 
vineyard their oliveyard and their hou also the hundredth part 
of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of 
them 

5 12 then said they we will restor them and will requir noth of 
them so will we do a thou sayest then i call the priest and 
took an oath of them that they should do accord to thi promi 

5 13 also i shook my lap and said so god shake out everi man from 
hi hou and from hi labour that performeth not thi promi even 
thu be he shaken out and empti and all the congreg said 
amen and prai the lord and the peopl did accord to thi 
promi 

5 14 moreov from the time that i wa appoint to be their governor 
in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and 
thirtieth year of artaxerx the king that is twelv year i and my 
brother have not eaten the bread of the governor 

5 15 but the former governor that had been befor me were chargeabl 
unto the peopl and had taken of them bread and wine besid forti 
shekel of silver yea even their servant bare rule over the peopl 
but so did not i becau of the fear of god 

5 16 yea also i continu in the work of thi wall neither bought we 
ani land and all my servant were gather thither unto the work 

5 17 moreov there were at my tabl an hundr and fifti of the jew 
and ruler besid those that came unto u from among the heathen that 
are about u 

5 18 now that which wa prepar for me daili wa one ox and six 
choic sheep also fowl were prepar for me and onc in ten day 
store of all sort of wine yet for all thi requir not i the bread 
of the governor becau the bondag wa heavi upon thi peopl 

5 19 think upon me my god for good accord to all that i have 
done for thi peopl 

6 1 now it came to pa when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the 
arabian and the rest of our enemi heard that i had build the 
wall and that there wa no breach left therein though at that time 
i had not set up the door upon the gate 6 2 that sanballat and 
geshem sent unto me say come let u meet togeth in some one of 
the villag in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief 

6 3 and i sent messeng unto them say i am do a great work 
so that i cannot come down whi should the work cea whilst i leav 
it and come down to you 6 4 yet they sent unto me four time after 
thi sort and i answer them after the same manner 

6 5 then sent sanballat hi servant unto me in like manner the fifth 
time with an open letter in hi hand 6 6 wherein wa written it is 
report among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the 
jew think to rebel for which cau thou buildest the wall that thou 
mayest be their king accord to these word 

6 7 and thou hast also appoint prophet to preach of thee at 
jerusalem say there is a king in judah and now shall it be 
report to the king accord to these word come now therefor and 
let u take counsel togeth 

6 8 then i sent unto him say there are no such thing done a 
thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart 

6 9 for they all made u afraid say their hand shall be weaken 
from the work that it be not done now therefor o god strengthen 
my hand 

6 10 afterward i came unto the hou of shemaiah the son of delaiah 
the son of mehetabeel who wa shut up and he said let u meet 
togeth in the hou of god within the templ and let u shut the 
door of the templ for they will come to slay thee yea in the 
night will they come to slay thee 

6 11 and i said should such a man a i flee and who is there that 
be a i am would go into the templ to save hi life i will not 
go in 

6 12 and lo i perceiv that god had not sent him but that he 
pronounc thi propheci against me for tobiah and sanballat had 
hire him 

6 13 therefor wa he hire that i should be afraid and do so and 
sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they 
might reproach me 

6 14 my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat accord to these 
their work and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the 
prophet that would have put me in fear 

6 15 so the wall wa finish in the twenti and fifth day of the month 
elul in fifti and two day 

6 16 and it came to pa that when all our enemi heard thereof and 
all the heathen that were about u saw these thing they were much 
cast down in their own eye for they perceiv that thi work wa

proudli against them so didst thou get thee a name a it is thi 
day 

9 11 and thou didst divid the sea befor them so that they went 
through the midst of the sea on the dri land and their persecutor 
thou threwest into the deep a a stone into the mighti water 

9 12 moreov thou leddest them in the day by a cloudi pillar and in

harden their neck and in their rebellion appoint a captain to

them not 

9 18 yea when they had made them a molten calf and said thi is thi 
god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great 
provoc 9 19 yet thou in thi manifold merci forsookest them 
not in the wilder the pillar of the cloud depart not from them 
by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night 
to shew them light and the way wherein they should go 

9 20 thou gavest also thi good spirit to instruct them and 
withheldest not thi manna from their mouth and gavest them water for

9 26 nevertheless they were disobedi and rebel against thee 
and cast thi law behind their back and slew thi prophet which 
testifi against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great 
provoc 

9 27 therefor thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemi 
who vex them and in the time of their troubl when they cri unto

had the dominion over them yet when they return and cri unto 
thee thou heardest them from heaven and mani time didst thou 
deliv them accord to thi merci 9 29 and testifiedst against 
them that thou mightest bring them again unto thi law yet they dealt 
proudli and hearken not unto thi command but sin against

withdrew the shoulder and harden their neck and would not hear 

9 30 yet mani year didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against

becau they met not the child of israel with bread and with water

thirtieth year of artaxerx king of babylon came i unto the king and 
after certain day obtain i leav of the king 13 7 and i came to 
jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in

stuff to tobiah out of the chamber 

13 9 then i command and they clean the chamber and thither 
brought i again the vessel of the hou of god with the meat 
offer and the frankincen 

13 10 and i perceiv that the portion of the levit had not been 
given them for the levit and the singer that did the work were 
fled everi one to hi field 

13 11 then contend i with the ruler and said whi is the hou of 
god forsaken and i gather them togeth and set them in their 
place 

13 12 then brought all judah the tith of the corn and the new wine

13 13 and i made treasur over the treasuri shelemiah the priest 
and zadok the scribe and of the levit pedaiah and next to them

count faith and their offic wa to distribut unto their 
brother 

13 14 rememb me o my god concern thi and wipe not out my good 
deed that i have done for the hou of my god and for the offic 
thereof 

13 15 in those day saw i in judah some tread wine press on the 
sabbath and bring in sheaf and lade as a also wine 
grape and fig and all manner of burden which they brought into 
jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testifi against them in the day 
wherein they sold victual 

13 16 there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and 
all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the child of 
judah and in jerusalem 

13 17 then i contend with the nobl of judah and said unto them 
what evil thing is thi that ye do and profan the sabbath day 
13 18 did not your father thu and did not our god bring all thi 
evil upon u and upon thi citi yet ye bring more wrath upon israel 
by profan the sabbath 

13 19 and it came to pa that when the gate of jerusalem began to 
be dark befor the sabbath i command that the gate should be shut 
and charg that they should not be open till after the sabbath and 
some of my servant set i at the gate that there should no burden be 
brought in on the sabbath day 

13 20 so the merchant and seller of all kind of ware lodg without 
jerusalem onc or twice 

13 21 then i testifi against them and said unto them whi lodg ye 
about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hand on you from that 
time forth came they no more on the sabbath 

13 22 and i command the levit that they should clean themselv 
and that they should come and keep the gate to sanctifi the sabbath 
day 

rememb me o my god concern thi also and spare me accord to

speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jew languag but

13 25 and i contend with them and cur them and smote certain of 
them and pluck off their hair and made them swear by god say

2 12 and when they lift up their eye afar off and knew him not 
they lift up their voic and wept and they rent everi one hi 
mantl and sprinkl dust upon their head toward heaven 

2 13 so they sat down with him upon the ground seven day and seven

neither let the light shine upon it 

3 5 let dark and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell 
upon it let the black of the day terrifi it 

3 6 a for that night let dark seiz upon it let it not be 
join unto the day of the year let it not come into the number of

3 9 let the star of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for 
light but have none neither let it see the dawn of the day 3 10 
becau it shut not up the door of my mother s womb nor hid sorrow 
from mine eye 

3 11 whi die i not from the womb whi did i not give up the ghost 
when i came out of the belli 3 12 whi did the knee prevent me or 
whi the breast that i should suck 3 13 for now should i have lain 
still and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest 
3 14 with king and counsellor of the earth which build desol 
place for themselv 3 15 or with princ that had gold who fill 
their hou with silver 3 16 or a an hidden untim birth i had 
not been a infant which never saw light 

3 17 there the wick cea from troubl and there the weari be at 
rest 

3 18 there the prison rest togeth they hear not the voic of the 
oppressor 

3 19 the small and great are there and the servant is free from hi 
master 

3 20 wherefor is light given to him that is in miseri and life unto 
the bitter in soul 3 21 which long for death but it cometh not and 
dig for it more than for hid treasur 3 22 which rejoic 
exceedingli and are glad when they can find the grave 3 23 whi is 
light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedg in 
3 24 for my sigh cometh befor i eat and my roar are pour 
out like the water 

3 25 for the thing which i greatli fear is come upon me and that 
which i wa afraid of is come unto me 

3 26 i wa not in safeti neither had i rest neither wa i quiet yet 
troubl came 

4 1 then eliphaz the temanit answer and said 4 2 if we assay to 
commun with thee wilt thou be griev but who can withhold himself 
from speak 4 3 behold thou hast instruct mani and thou hast 
strengthen the weak hand 

4 4 thi word have upholden him that wa fall and thou hast 
strengthen the feebl knee 

4 5 but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee 
and thou art troubl 

4 6 is not thi thi fear thi confid thi hope and the 
upright of thi way 4 7 rememb i pray thee who ever 
perish be innoc or where were the righteou cut off 4 8 
even a i have seen they that plow iniqu and sow wick reap 
the same 

4 9 by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of hi nostril 
are they consum 

4 10 the roar of the lion and the voic of the fierc lion and 
the teeth of the young lion are broken 

4 11 the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lion s 
whelp are scatter abroad 

4 12 now a thing wa secretli brought to me and mine ear receiv a 
littl thereof 

4 13 in thought from the vision of the night when deep sleep 
falleth on men 4 14 fear came upon me and trembl which made all 
my bone to shake 

4 15 then a spirit pa befor my face the hair of my flesh stood 
up 4 16 it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an 
imag wa befor mine eye there wa silenc and i heard a voic 
say 4 17 shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be 
more pure than hi maker 4 18 behold he put no trust in hi 
servant and hi angel he charg with folli 4 19 how much le in 
them that dwell in hou of clay whose foundat is in the dust 
which are crush befor the moth 4 20 they are destroy from 
morn to even they perish for ever without ani regard it 

4 21 doth not their excel which is in them go away they die 
even without wisdom 

5 1 call now if there be ani that will answer thee and to which of

envi slayeth the silli one 

5 3 i have seen the foolish take root but suddenli i cur hi

5 4 hi child are far from safeti and they are crush in the 
gate neither is there ani to deliv them 

5 5 whose harvest the hungri eateth up and taketh it even out of the 
thorn and the robber swalloweth up their substanc 

5 6 although afflict cometh not forth of the dust neither doth 
troubl spring out of the ground 5 7 yet man is born unto troubl a 
the spark fli upward 

5 8 i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cau 5 9 
which doeth great thing and unsearch marvel thing without 
number 5 10 who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth water upon 
the field 5 11 to set up on high those that be low that those which 
mourn may be exalt to safeti 

5 12 he disappointeth the devic of the crafti so that their hand 
cannot perform their enterpri 

5 13 he taketh the wise in their own crafti and the counsel of 
the froward is carri headlong 

5 14 they meet with dark in the day time and grope in the noonday 
a in the night 

5 15 but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from 
the hand of the mighti 

5 16 so the poor hath hope and iniqu stoppeth her mouth 

5 17 behold happi is the man whom god correcteth therefor despi

thou be afraid of destruct when it cometh 

5 22 at destruct and famin thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be 
afraid of the beast of the earth

beast of the field shall be at peac with thee

7 11 therefor i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the 
anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitter of my soul 

7 12 am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me 7 13 
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ea my 
complaint 7 14 then thou scarest me with dream and terrifiest me

7 17 what is man that thou shouldest magnifi him and that thou

that i am a burden to myself 7 21 and whi dost thou not pardon my 
transgress and take away my iniqu for now shall i sleep in the 
dust and thou shalt seek me in the morn but i shall not be 

8 1 then answer bildad the shuhit and said 8 2 how long wilt thou 
speak these thing and how long shall the word of thi mouth be like 
a strong wind 8 3 doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighti 
pervert justic 8 4 if thi child have sin against him and he 
have cast them away for their transgress 8 5 if thou wouldest seek 
unto god betim and make thi supplic to the almighti 8 6 if 
thou wert pure and upright sure now he would awak for thee and 
make the habit of thi righteou prosper 

8 7 though thi begin wa small yet thi latter end should greatli 
increa 

8 8 for enquir i pray thee of the former age and prepar thyself 
to the search of their father 8 9 for we are but of yesterday and 
know noth becau our day upon earth are a shadow 8 10 shall 
not they teach thee and tell thee and utter word out of their 
heart 8 11 can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow 
without water 8 12 whilst it is yet in hi green and not cut 
down it withereth befor ani other herb 

8 13 so are the path of all that forget god and the hypocrit s hope 
shall perish 8 14 whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall 
be a spider s web 

8 15 he shall lean upon hi hou but it shall not stand he shall 
hold it fast but it shall not endur 

8 16 he is green befor the sun and hi branch shooteth forth in hi 
garden 

8 17 hi root are wrap about the heap and seeth the place of 
stone 

8 18 if he destroy him from hi place then it shall deni him say 
i have not seen thee 

8 19 behold thi is the joy of hi way and out of the earth shall 
other grow 

8 20 behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he 
help the evil doer 8 21 till he fill thi mouth with laugh and 
thi lip with rejoic 

8 22 they that hate thee shall be cloth with shame and the dwell 
place of the wick shall come to nought 

9 1 then job answer and said 9 2 i know it is so of a truth but 
how should man be just with god 9 3 if he will contend with him he 
cannot answer him one of a thousand 

9 4 he is wise in heart and mighti in strength who hath harden 
himself against him and hath prosper 9 5 which removeth the 
mountain and they know not which overturneth them in hi anger 

9 6 which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillar thereof 
trembl 

9 7 which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the 
star 

9 8 which alon spreadeth out the heaven and treadeth upon the wave 
of the sea 

9 9 which maketh arcturu orion and pleiad and the chamber of 
the south 

9 10 which doeth great thing past find out yea and wonder 
without number 

9 11 lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i 
perceiv him not 

9 12 behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto 
him what doest thou 9 13 if god will not withdraw hi anger the 
proud helper do stoop under him 

9 14 how much le shall i answer him and choo out my word to 
reason with him 9 15 whom though i were righteou yet would i not 
answer but i would make supplic to my judg 

9 16 if i had call and he had answer me yet would i not believ 
that he had hearken unto my voic 

9 17 for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wound 
without cau 

9 18 he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with 
bitter 

9 19 if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who 
shall set me a time to plead 9 20 if i justifi myself mine own 
mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me 
perver 

9 21 though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would 
despi my life 

9 22 thi is one thing therefor i said it he destroyeth the perfect 
and the wick 

9 23 if the scourg slay suddenli he will laugh at the trial of the 
innoc 

9 24 the earth is given into the hand of the wick he covereth the 
face of the judg thereof if not where and who is he 9 25 now 
my day are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good 

9 26 they are pa away a the swift ship a the eagl that 
hasteth to the prey 

9 27 if i say i will forget my complaint i will leav off my 
heavi and comfort myself 9 28 i am afraid of all my sorrow i 
know that thou wilt not hold me innoc 

9 29 if i be wick whi then labour i in vain 9 30 if i wash myself 
with snow water and make my hand never so clean 9 31 yet shalt thou 
plung me in the ditch and mine own cloth shall abhor me 

9 32 for he is not a man a i am that i should answer him and we 
should come togeth in judgment 

9 33 neither is there ani daysman betwixt u that might lay hi hand 
upon u both 

9 34 let him take hi rod away from me and let not hi fear terrifi 
me 9 35 then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with 
me 

10 1 my soul is weari of my life i will leav my complaint upon 
myself i will speak in the bitter of my soul 

10 2 i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefor thou 
contendest with me 

10 3 is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou 
shouldest despi the work of thine hand and shine upon the counsel 
of the wick 10 4 hast thou eye of flesh or seest thou a man 
seeth 10 5 are thi day a the day of man are thi year a man s 
day 10 6 that thou enquirest after mine iniqu and searchest 
after my sin 10 7 thou knowest that i am not wick and there is 
none that can deliv out of thine hand 

10 8 thine hand have made me and fashion me togeth round about 
yet thou dost destroy me 

10 9 rememb i beseech thee that thou hast made me a the clay and 
wilt thou bring me into dust again 10 10 hast thou not pour me out 
a milk and curdl me like chee 10 11 thou hast cloth me with 
skin and flesh and hast fenc me with bone and sinew 

10 12 thou hast grant me life and favour and thi visit hath 
preserv my spirit 

10 13 and these thing hast thou hid in thine heart i know that thi 
is with thee 

10 14 if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from 
mine iniqu 

10 15 if i be wick woe unto me and if i be righteou yet will i 
not lift up my head i am full of confu therefor see thou mine 
afflict 10 16 for it increaseth thou huntest me a a fierc lion 
and again thou shewest thyself marvel upon me 

10 17 thou renewest thi wit against me and increasest thine 
indign upon me chang and war are against me 

10 18 wherefor then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh 
that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me 10 19 i should 
have been a though i had not been i should have been carri from 
the womb to the grave 

10 20 are not my day few cea then and let me alon that i may 
take comfort a littl 10 21 befor i go whenc i shall not return 
even to the land of dark and the shadow of death 10 22 a land of 
dark a dark itself and of the shadow of death without ani 
order and where the light is a dark 

11 1 then answer zophar the naamathit and said 11 2 should not 
the multitud of word be answer and should a man full of talk be 
justifi 11 3 should thi lie make men hold their peac and when 
thou mockest shall no man make thee asham 11 4 for thou hast 
said my doctrin is pure and i am clean in thine eye 

11 5 but oh that god would speak and open hi lip against thee 11 6 
and that he would shew thee the secret of wisdom that they are 
doubl to that which is know therefor that god exacteth of thee le 
than thine iniqu deserveth 

11 7 canst thou by search find out god canst thou find out the 
almighti unto perfect 11 8 it is a high a heaven what canst 
thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know 11 9 the measur 
thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea 

11 10 if he cut off and shut up or gather togeth then who can 
hinder him 11 11 for he knoweth vain men he seeth wick also 
will he not then consid it 11 12 for vain men would be wise 
though man be born like a wild a s colt 

11 13 if thou prepar thine heart and stretch out thine hand toward 
him 11 14 if iniqu be in thine hand put it far away and let not 
wick dwell in thi tabernacl 

11 15 for then shalt thou lift up thi face without spot yea thou 
shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear 11 16 becau thou shalt forget 
thi miseri and rememb it a water that pa away 11 17 and thine 
age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou 
shalt be a the morn 

11 18 and thou shalt be secur becau there is hope yea thou shalt 
dig about thee and thou shalt take thi rest in safeti 

11 19 also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea 
mani shall make suit unto thee 

11 20 but the eye of the wick shall fail and they shall not 
escap and their hope shall be a the give up of the ghost 

12 1 and job answer and said 12 2 no doubt but ye are the peopl 
and wisdom shall die with you 

12 3 but i have understand a well a you i am not inferior to 
you yea who knoweth not such thing a these 12 4 i am a one 
mock of hi neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him 
the just upright man is laugh to scorn 

12 5 he that is readi to slip with hi foot is a a lamp despi in 
the thought of him that is at ea 

12 6 the tabernacl of robber prosper and they that provok god are 
secur into whose hand god bringeth abundantli 

12 7 but ask now the beast and they shall teach thee and the fowl 
of the air and they shall tell thee 12 8 or speak to the earth and 
it shall teach thee and the fish of the sea shall declar unto 
thee 

12 9 who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath 
wrought thi 12 10 in whose hand is the soul of everi live thing 
and the breath of all mankind 

12 11 doth not the ear tri word and the mouth tast hi meat 12 12 
with the ancient is wisdom and in length of day understand 

12 13 with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and 
understand 

12 14 behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he 
shutteth up a man and there can be no open 

12 15 behold he withholdeth the water and they dri up also he 
sendeth them out and they overturn the earth 

12 16 with him is strength and wisdom the deceiv and the deceiv 
are hi 

12 17 he leadeth counsellor away spoil and maketh the judg 
fool 

12 18 he looseth the bond of king and girdeth their loin with a 
girdl 

12 19 he leadeth princ away spoil and overthroweth the mighti 

12 20 he removeth away the speech of the trusti and taketh away the 
understand of the age 

12 21 he poureth contempt upon princ and weakeneth the strength of 
the mighti 

12 22 he discovereth deep thing out of dark and bringeth out to 
light the shadow of death 

12 23 he increaseth the nation and destroyeth them he enlargeth the 
nation and straiteneth them again 

12 24 he taketh away the heart of the chief of the peopl of the 
earth and causeth them to wander in a wilder where there is no 
way 

12 25 they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to 
stagger like a drunken man 

13 1 lo mine eye hath seen all thi mine ear hath heard and 
understood it 

13 2 what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior unto 
you 

13 3 sure i would speak to the almighti and i desir to reason with 
god 

13 4 but ye are forger of lie ye are all physician of no valu 

13 5 o that ye would altogeth hold your peac and it should be your 
wisdom 

13 6 hear now my reason and hearken to the plead of my lip 

13 7 will ye speak wickedli for god and talk deceit for him 
13 8 will ye accept hi person will ye contend for god 13 9 is it 
good that he should search you out or a one man mocketh anoth do 
ye so mock him 13 10 he will sure reprov you if ye do secretli 
accept person 

13 11 shall not hi excel make you afraid and hi dread fall 
upon you 13 12 your remembr are like unto ash your bodi to 
bodi of clay 

13 13 hold your peac let me alon that i may speak and let come on 
me what will 

13 14 wherefor do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in 
mine hand 13 15 though he slay me yet will i trust in him but i 
will maintain mine own way befor him 

13 16 he also shall be my salvat for an hypocrit shall not come 
befor him 

13 17 hear dilig my speech and my declar with your ear 

13 18 behold now i have order my cau i know that i shall be 
justifi 

13 19 who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tongu 
i shall give up the ghost 

13 20 onli do not two thing unto me then will i not hide myself from 
thee 

13 21 withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thi dread make me 
afraid 

13 22 then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer 
thou me 

13 23 how mani are mine iniqu and sin make me to know my 
transgress and my sin 

13 24 wherefor hidest thou thi face and holdest me for thine enemi 
13 25 wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursu 
the dri stubbl 13 26 for thou writest bitter thing against me and 
makest me to po the iniqu of my youth 

13 27 thou puttest my foot also in the stock and lookest narrowli 
unto all my path thou settest a print upon the heel of my foot 

13 28 and he a a rotten thing consumeth a a garment that is moth 
eaten 

14 1 man that is born of a woman is of few day and full of troubl 

14 2 he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also a 
a shadow and continueth not 

14 3 and doth thou open thine eye upon such an one and bringest me 
into judgment with thee 14 4 who can bring a clean thing out of an 
unclean not one 

14 5 see hi day are determin the number of hi month are with 
thee thou hast appoint hi bound that he cannot pa 14 6 turn 
from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish a an hirel 
hi day 

14 7 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will 
sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cea 

14 8 though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock 
thereof die in the ground 14 9 yet through the scent of water it will 
bud and bring forth bough like a plant 

14 10 but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost 
and where is he 14 11 a the water fail from the sea and the flood 
decayeth and drieth up 14 12 so man lieth down and riseth not till 
the heaven be no more they shall not awak nor be rai out of 
their sleep 

14 13 o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest 
keep me secret until thi wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me 
a set time and rememb me 14 14 if a man die shall he live again 
all the day of my appoint time will i wait till my chang come 

14 15 thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desir 
to the work of thine hand 

14 16 for now thou numberest my step dost thou not watch over my 
sin 14 17 my transgress is seal up in a bag and thou sewest up 
mine iniqu 

14 18 and sure the mountain fall cometh to nought and the rock 
is remov out of hi place 

14 19 the water wear the stone thou washest away the thing which 
grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of 
man 

14 20 thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou 
changest hi counten and sendest him away 

14 21 hi son come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are 
brought low but he perceiveth it not of them 

14 22 but hi flesh upon him shall have pain and hi soul within him 
shall mourn 

15 1 then answer eliphaz the temanit and said 15 2 should a wise 
man utter vain knowledg and fill hi belli with the east wind 15 3 
should he reason with unprofit talk or with speech wherewith he 
can do no good 15 4 yea thou castest off fear and restrainest 
prayer befor god 

15 5 for thi mouth uttereth thine iniqu and thou choosest the 
tongu of the crafti 

15 6 thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lip 
testifi against thee 

15 7 art thou the first man that wa born or wast thou made befor 
the hill 15 8 hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou 
restrain wisdom to thyself 15 9 what knowest thou that we know not 
what understandest thou which is not in u 15 10 with u are both 
the grayhead and veri age men much elder than thi father 

15 11 are the consol of god small with thee is there ani secret 
thing with thee 15 12 whi doth thine heart carri thee away and what 
do thi eye wink at 15 13 that thou turnest thi spirit against god 
and lettest such word go out of thi mouth 15 14 what is man that 
he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be 
righteou 15 15 behold he putteth no trust in hi saint yea the 
heaven are not clean in hi sight 

15 16 how much more abomin and filthi is man which drinketh 
iniqu like water 15 17 i will shew thee hear me and that which 
i have seen i will declar 15 18 which wise men have told from their 
father and have not hid it 15 19 unto whom alon the earth wa 
given and no stranger pa among them 

15 20 the wick man travaileth with pain all hi day and the number 
of year is hidden to the oppressor 

15 21 a dread sound is in hi ear in prosper the destroy 
shall come upon him 

15 22 he believeth not that he shall return out of dark and he is 
wait for of the sword 

15 23 he wandereth abroad for bread say where is it he knoweth 
that the day of dark is readi at hi hand 

15 24 troubl and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail 
against him a a king readi to the battl 

15 25 for he stretcheth out hi hand against god and strengtheneth 
himself against the almighti 

15 26 he runneth upon him even on hi neck upon the thick bo of 
hi buckler 15 27 becau he covereth hi face with hi fat and 
maketh collop of fat on hi flank 

15 28 and he dwelleth in desol citi and in hou which no man 
inhabiteth which are readi to becom heap 

15 29 he shall not be rich neither shall hi substanc continu 
neither shall he prolong the perfect thereof upon the earth 

15 30 he shall not depart out of dark the flame shall dri up hi 
branch and by the breath of hi mouth shall he go away 

15 31 let not him that is deceiv trust in vaniti for vaniti shall 
be hi recomp 

15 32 it shall be accomplish befor hi time and hi branch shall 
not be green 

15 33 he shall shake off hi unrip grape a the vine and shall cast 
off hi flower a the oliv 

15 34 for the congreg of hypocrit shall be desol and fire 
shall consum the tabernacl of briberi 

15 35 they conceiv mischief and bring forth vaniti and their belli 
prepareth deceit 

16 1 then job answer and said 16 2 i have heard mani such thing 
miser comfort are ye all 

16 3 shall vain word have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou 
answerest 16 4 i also could speak a ye do if your soul were in my 
soul s stead i could heap up word against you and shake mine head 
at you 

16 5 but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the move of my 
lip should asswag your grief 

16 6 though i speak my grief is not asswag and though i forbear 
what am i ea 16 7 but now he hath made me weari thou hast made 
desol all my compani 

16 8 and thou hast fill me with wrinkl which is a wit against 
me and my lean rise up in me beareth wit to my face 

16 9 he teareth me in hi wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me 
with hi teeth mine enemi sharpeneth hi eye upon me 

16 10 they have gape upon me with their mouth they have smitten me 
upon the cheek reproach they have gather themselv togeth 
against me 

16 11 god hath deliv me to the ungodli and turn me over into 
the hand of the wick 

16 12 i wa at ea but he hath broken me asund he hath also taken 
me by my neck and shaken me to piec and set me up for hi mark 

16 13 hi archer compass me round about he cleaveth my rein 
asund and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground 

16 14 he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like 
a giant 

16 15 i have sew sackcloth upon my skin and defil my horn in the 
dust 

16 16 my face is foul with weep and on my eyelid is the shadow of 
death 16 17 not for ani injust in mine hand also my prayer is 
pure 

16 18 o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cri have no place 

16 19 also now behold my wit is in heaven and my record is on 
high 

16 20 my friend scorn me but mine eye poureth out tear unto god 

16 21 o that one might plead for a man with god a a man pleadeth for 
hi neighbour 16 22 when a few year are come then i shall go the 
way whenc i shall not return 

17 1 my breath is corrupt my day are extinct the graf are readi 
for me 

17 2 are there not mocker with me and doth not mine eye continu in 
their provoc 17 3 lay down now put me in a sureti with thee 
who is he that will strike hand with me 17 4 for thou hast hid 
their heart from understand therefor shalt thou not exalt them 

17 5 he that speaketh flatteri to hi friend even the eye of hi 
child shall fail 

17 6 he hath made me also a byword of the peopl and aforetim i wa 
a a tabret 

17 7 mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my member are 
a a shadow 

17 8 upright men shall be astoni at thi and the innoc shall 
stir up himself against the hypocrit 

17 9 the righteou also shall hold on hi way and he that hath clean 
hand shall be stronger and stronger 

17 10 but a for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot 
find one wise man among you 

17 11 my day are past my purpo are broken off even the thought 
of my heart 

17 12 they chang the night into day the light is short becau of 
dark 

17 13 if i wait the grave is mine hou i have made my bed in the 
dark 

17 14 i have said to corrupt thou art my father to the worm thou 
art my mother and my sister 

17 15 and where is now my hope a for my hope who shall see it 
17 16 they shall go down to the bar of the pit when our rest 
togeth is in the dust 

18 1 then answer bildad the shuhit and said 18 2 how long will it 
be ere ye make an end of word mark and afterward we will speak 

18 3 wherefor are we count a beast and reput vile in your 
sight 18 4 he teareth himself in hi anger shall the earth be 
forsaken for thee and shall the rock be remov out of hi place 
18 5 yea the light of the wick shall be put out and the spark of 
hi fire shall not shine 

18 6 the light shall be dark in hi tabernacl and hi candl shall 
be put out with him 

18 7 the step of hi strength shall be straiten and hi own 
counsel shall cast him down 

18 8 for he is cast into a net by hi own foot and he walketh upon a 
snare 

18 9 the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail 
against him

understand causeth me to answer 

20 4 knowest thou not thi of old sinc man wa place upon earth 
20 5 that the triumph of the wick is short and the joy of the 
hypocrit but for a moment 20 6 though hi excel mount up to

20 17 he shall not see the river the flood the brook of honey and

20 23 when he is about to fill hi belli god shall cast the furi of 
hi wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eat

20 29 thi is the portion of a wick man from god and the heritag 
appoint unto him by god 

21 1 but job answer and said 21 2 hear dilig my speech and

21 3 suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock 
on 

21 4 a for me is my complaint to man and if it were so whi should 
not my spirit be troubl 21 5 mark me and be astonish and lay 
your hand upon your mouth 

21 6 even when i rememb i am afraid and trembl taketh hold on my 
flesh 

21 7 wherefor do the wick live becom old yea are mighti in 
power 21 8 their seed is establish in their sight with them and 
their offspr befor their eye 

21 9 their hou are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon 
them 

21 10 their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and 
casteth not her calf 

21 11 they send forth their littl one like a flock and their 
child danc 

21 12 they take the timbrel and harp and rejoic at the sound of the 
organ 

21 13 they spend their day in wealth and in a moment go down to the 
grave 

21 14 therefor they say unto god depart from u for we desir not 
the knowledg of thi way 

21 15 what is the almighti that we should serv him and what profit 
should we have if we pray unto him 21 16 lo their good is not in 
their hand the counsel of the wick is far from me 

21 17 how oft is the candl of the wick put out and how oft cometh 
their destruct upon them god distributeth sorrow in hi anger 

21 18 they are a stubbl befor the wind and a chaff that the storm 
carrieth away 

21 19 god layeth up hi iniqu for hi child he rewardeth him 
and he shall know it 

21 20 hi eye shall see hi destruct and he shall drink of the 
wrath of the almighti 

21 21 for what pleasur hath he in hi hou after him when the 
number of hi month is cut off in the midst 21 22 shall ani teach 
god knowledg see he judgeth those that are high 

21 23 one dieth in hi full strength be wholli at ea and quiet 

21 24 hi breast are full of milk and hi bone are moisten with 
marrow 

21 25 and anoth dieth in the bitter of hi soul and never 
eateth with pleasur 

21 26 they shall lie down alik in the dust and the worm shall cover 
them 

21 27 behold i know your thought and the devic which ye 
wrong imagin against me 

21 28 for ye say where is the hou of the princ and where are the 
dwell place of the wick 21 29 have ye not ask them that go 
by the way and do ye not know their token 21 30 that the wick is 
reserv to the day of destruct they shall be brought forth to the 
day of wrath 

21 31 who shall declar hi way to hi face and who shall repay him 
what he hath done 21 32 yet shall he be brought to the grave and 
shall remain in the tomb 

21 33 the clod of the valley shall be sweet unto him and everi man 
shall draw after him a there are innum befor him 

21 34 how then comfort ye me in vain see in your answer there 
remaineth falsehood 22 1 then eliphaz the temanit answer and 
said 22 2 can a man be profit unto god a he that is wise may be 
profit unto himself 22 3 is it ani pleasur to the almighti 
that thou art righteou or is it gain to him that thou makest thi 
way perfect 22 4 will he reprov thee for fear of thee will he 
enter with thee into judgment 22 5 is not thi wick great and 
thine iniqu infinit 22 6 for thou hast taken a pledg from thi 
brother for nought and strip the nake of their cloth 

22 7 thou hast not given water to the weari to drink and thou hast 
withholden bread from the hungri 

22 8 but a for the mighti man he had the earth and the honour 
man dwelt in it 

22 9 thou hast sent widow away empti and the arm of the fatherless 
have been broken 

22 10 therefor snare are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth 
thee 22 11 or dark that thou canst not see and abund of 
water cover thee 

22 12 is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the 
star how high they are 22 13 and thou sayest how doth god know 
can he judg through the dark cloud 22 14 thick cloud are a 
cover to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of 
heaven 

22 15 hast thou mark the old way which wick men have trodden 
22 16 which were cut down out of time whose foundat wa overflown 
with a flood 22 17 which said unto god depart from u and what can 
the almighti do for them 22 18 yet he fill their hou with good 
thing but the counsel of the wick is far from me 

22 19 the righteou see it and are glad and the innoc laugh them 
to scorn 

22 20 wherea our substanc is not cut down but the remnant of them 
the fire consumeth 

22 21 acquaint now thyself with him and be at peac therebi good 
shall come unto thee 

22 22 receiv i pray thee the law from hi mouth and lay up hi 
word in thine heart 

22 23 if thou return to the almighti thou shalt be built up thou 
shalt put away iniqu far from thi tabernacl 

22 24 then shalt thou lay up gold a dust and the gold of ophir a 
the stone of the brook 

22 25 yea the almighti shall be thi defenc and thou shalt have 
plenti of silver 

22 26 for then shalt thou have thi delight in the almighti and shalt 
lift up thi face unto god 

22 27 thou shalt make thi prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and 
thou shalt pay thi vow 

22 28 thou shalt also decr a thing and it shall be establish unto 
thee and the light shall shine upon thi way 

22 29 when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lift 
up and he shall save the humbl person 

22 30 he shall deliv the island of the innoc and it is deliv 
by the pure of thine hand 

23 1 then job answer and said 23 2 even to day is my complaint 
bitter my stroke is heavier than my groan 

23 3 oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to 
hi seat 23 4 i would order my cau befor him and fill my mouth 
with argument 

23 5 i would know the word which he would answer me and understand 
what he would say unto me 

23 6 will he plead against me with hi great power no but he would 
put strength in me 

23 7 there the righteou might disput with him so should i be 
deliv for ever from my judg 

23 8 behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i 
cannot perceiv him 23 9 on the left hand where he doth work but i 
cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot 
see him 23 10 but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tri 
me i shall come forth a gold 

23 11 my foot hath held hi step hi way have i kept and not 
declin 

23 12 neither have i gone back from the command of hi lip i 
have esteem the word of hi mouth more than my necessari food 

23 13 but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what hi soul 
desireth even that he doeth 

23 14 for he performeth the thing that is appoint for me and mani 
such thing are with him 

23 15 therefor am i troubl at hi presenc when i consid i am 
afraid of him 

23 16 for god maketh my heart soft and the almighti troubleth me 
23 17 becau i wa not cut off befor the dark neither hath he 
cover the dark from my face 

24 1 whi see time are not hidden from the almighti do they that 
know him not see hi day 24 2 some remov the landmark they 
violent take away flock and feed thereof 

24 3 they drive away the a of the fatherless they take the widow s 
ox for a pledg 

24 4 they turn the needi out of the way the poor of the earth hide 
themselv togeth 

24 5 behold a wild as in the desert go they forth to their work 
rise betim for a prey the wilder yieldeth food for them and 
for their child 

24 6 they reap everi one hi corn in the field and they gather the 
vintag of the wick 

24 7 they cau the nake to lodg without cloth that they have no 
cover in the cold 

24 8 they are wet with the shower of the mountain and embrac the 
rock for want of a shelter 

24 9 they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledg of 
the poor 

24 10 they cau him to go nake without cloth and they take away 
the sheaf from the hungri 24 11 which make oil within their wall 
and tread their winepress and suffer thirst 

24 12 men groan from out of the citi and the soul of the wound 
crieth out yet god layeth not folli to them 

24 13 they are of those that rebel against the light they know not 
the way thereof nor abid in the path thereof 

24 14 the murder rise with the light killeth the poor and needi 
and in the night is a a thief 

24 15 the eye also of the adult waiteth for the twilight say 
no eye shall see me and disguiseth hi face 

24 16 in the dark they dig through hou which they had mark for 
themselv in the daytim they know not the light 

24 17 for the morn is to them even a the shadow of death if one 
know them they are in the terror of the shadow of death 

24 18 he is swift a the water their portion is cur in the earth 
he beholdeth not the way of the vineyard 

24 19 drought and heat consum the snow water so doth the grave 
those which have sin 

24 20 the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetli on him 
he shall be no more rememb and wick shall be broken a a 
tree 

24 21 he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not 
good to the widow 

24 22 he draweth also the mighti with hi power he riseth up and no 
man is sure of life 

24 23 though it be given him to be in safeti whereon he resteth yet 
hi eye are upon their way 

24 24 they are exalt for a littl while but are gone and brought 
low they are taken out of the way a all other and cut off a the 
top of the ear of corn 

24 25 and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my 
speech noth worth 25 1 then answer bildad the shuhit and 
said 25 2 dominion and fear are with him he maketh peac in hi high 
place 

25 3 is there ani number of hi armi and upon whom doth not hi 
light ari 25 4 how then can man be justifi with god or how can 
he be clean that is born of a woman 25 5 behold even to the moon 
and it shineth not yea the star are not pure in hi sight 

25 6 how much le man that is a worm and the son of man which is a 
worm 26 1 but job answer and said 26 2 how hast thou help him 
that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength 
26 3 how hast thou counsel him that hath no wisdom and how hast 
thou plenti declar the thing a it is 26 4 to whom hast thou 
utter word and whose spirit came from thee 26 5 dead thing are 
form from under the water and the inhabit thereof 

26 6 hell is nake befor him and destruct hath no cover 

26 7 he stretcheth out the north over the empti place and hangeth the 
earth upon noth 

26 8 he bindeth up the water in hi thick cloud and the cloud is 
not rent under them 

26 9 he holdeth back the face of hi throne and spreadeth hi cloud 
upon it 

26 10 he hath compass the water with bound until the day and 
night come to an end 

26 11 the pillar of heaven trembl and are astonish at hi reproof 

26 12 he divideth the sea with hi power and by hi understand he 
smiteth through the proud 

26 13 by hi spirit he hath garnish the heaven hi hand hath 
form the crook serpent 

26 14 lo these are part of hi way but how littl a portion is 
heard of him but the thunder of hi power who can understand 27 1 
moreov job continu hi parabl and said 27 2 a god liveth who 
hath taken away my judgment and the almighti who hath vex my soul 
27 3 all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my 
nostril 27 4 my lip shall not speak wick nor my tongu utter 
deceit 

27 5 god forbid that i should justifi you till i die i will not 
remov mine integr from me 

27 6 my righteou i hold fast and will not let it go my heart 
shall not reproach me so long a i live 

27 7 let mine enemi be a the wick and he that riseth up against me 
a the unright 

27 8 for what is the hope of the hypocrit though he hath gain 
when god taketh away hi soul 27 9 will god hear hi cri when 
troubl cometh upon him 27 10 will he delight himself in the 
almighti will he alway call upon god 27 11 i will teach you by the 
hand of god that which is with the almighti will i not conceal 

27 12 behold all ye yourselv have seen it whi then are ye thu 
altogeth vain 27 13 thi is the portion of a wick man with god 
and the heritag of oppressor which they shall receiv of the 
almighti 

27 14 if hi child be multipli it is for the sword and hi 
offspr shall not be satisfi with bread 

27 15 those that remain of him shall be buri in death and hi 
widow shall not weep 

27 16 though he heap up silver a the dust and prepar raiment a the 
clay 27 17 he may prepar it but the just shall put it on and the 
innoc shall divid the silver 

27 18 he buildeth hi hou a a moth and a a booth that the keeper 
maketh 

27 19 the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gather he 
openeth hi eye and he is not 

27 20 terror take hold on him a water a tempest stealeth him away 
in the night 

27 21 the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and a a 
storm hurleth him out of hi place 

27 22 for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee 
out of hi hand 

27 23 men shall clap their hand at him and shall hiss him out of hi 
place 

28 1 sure there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where 
they fine it 

28 2 iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the 
stone 

28 3 he setteth an end to dark and searcheth out all perfect 
the stone of dark and the shadow of death 

28 4 the flood breaketh out from the inhabit even the water 
forgotten of the foot they are dri up they are gone away from men 

28 5 a for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turn 
up a it were fire 

28 6 the stone of it are the place of sapphir and it hath dust of 
gold 

28 7 there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultur s 
eye hath not seen 28 8 the lion s whelp have not trodden it nor the 
fierc lion pa by it 

28 9 he putteth forth hi hand upon the rock he overturneth the 
mountain by the root 

28 10 he cutteth out river among the rock and hi eye seeth everi 
preciou thing 

28 11 he bindeth the flood from overflow and the thing that is 
hid bringeth he forth to light 

28 12 but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of 
understand 28 13 man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it 
found in the land of the live 

28 14 the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not 
with me 

28 15 it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weigh 
for the price thereof 

28 16 it cannot be valu with the gold of ophir with the preciou 
onyx or the sapphir 

28 17 the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchang of it 
shall not be for jewel of fine gold 

28 18 no mention shall be made of coral or of pearl for the price 
of wisdom is abov rubi 

28 19 the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be 
valu with pure gold 

28 20 whenc then cometh wisdom and where is the place of 
understand 28 21 see it is hid from the eye of all live 
and kept close from the fowl of the air 

28 22 destruct and death say we have heard the fame thereof with 
our ear 

28 23 god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place 
thereof 

28 24 for he looketh to the end of the earth and seeth under the 
whole heaven 28 25 to make the weight for the wind and he weigheth 
the water by measur 

28 26 when he made a decr for the rain and a way for the lightn 
of the thunder 28 27 then did he see it and declar it he prepar 
it yea and search it out 

28 28 and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is 
wisdom and to depart from evil is understand 

29 1 moreov job continu hi parabl and said 29 2 oh that i were

god wa upon my tabernacl 29 5 when the almighti wa yet with me 
when my child were about me 29 6 when i wash my step with 
butter and the rock pour me out river of oil 29 7 when i went out 
to the gate through the citi when i prepar my seat in the street 
29 8 the young men saw me and hid themselv and the age aro and 
stood up 

29 9 the princ refrain talk and laid their hand on their 
mouth 

29 10 the nobl held their peac and their tongu cleav to the 
roof of their mouth 

29 11 when the ear heard me then it bless me and when the eye saw 
me it gave wit to me 29 12 becau i deliv the poor that 
cri and the fatherless and him that had none to help him 

29 13 the bless of him that wa readi to perish came upon me and i 
cau the widow s heart to sing for joy 

29 14 i put on righteou and it cloth me my judgment wa a a 
robe and a diadem 

29 15 i wa eye to the blind and foot wa i to the lame 

29 16 i wa a father to the poor and the cau which i knew not i 
search out 

29 17 and i brake the jaw of the wick and pluck the spoil out of 
hi teeth 

29 18 then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multipli my 
day a the sand 

29 19 my root wa spread out by the water and the dew lay all night 
upon my branch 

29 20 my glori wa fresh in me and my bow wa renew in my hand 

29 21 unto me men gave ear and wait and kept silenc at my 
counsel 

29 22 after my word they spake not again and my speech drop upon 
them 

29 23 and they wait for me a for the rain and they open their 
mouth wide a for the latter rain 

29 24 if i laugh on them they believ it not and the light of my 
counten they cast not down 

29 25 i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt a a king in the 
armi a one that comforteth the mourner 

30 1 but now they that are younger than i have me in deri whose 
father i would have disdain to have set with the dog of my flock 

30 2 yea whereto might the strength of their hand profit me in whom 
old age wa perish 30 3 for want and famin they were solitari 
flee into the wilder in former time desol and wast 

30 4 who cut up mallow by the bush and junip root for their 
meat 

30 5 they were driven forth from among men they cri after them a

of the earth and in the rock

my face 

30 11 becau he hath loo my cord and afflict me they have also

30 12 upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my foot and 
they rai up against me the way of their destruct 

30 13 they mar my path they set forward my calam they have no

desol they roll themselv upon me 

30 15 terror are turn upon me they pursu my soul a the wind and 
my welfar passeth away a a cloud 

30 16 and now my soul is pour out upon me the day of afflict

30 18 by the great forc of my disea is my garment chang it 
bindeth me about a the collar of my coat 

30 19 he hath cast me into the mire and i am becom like dust and 
ash 

30 20 i cri unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou 
regardest me not 

30 21 thou art becom cruel to me with thi strong hand thou opposest 
thyself against me 

30 22 thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it 
and dissolvest my substanc 

30 23 for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the hou 
appoint for all live 

30 24 howbeit he will not stretch out hi hand to the grave though 
they cri in hi destruct 

30 25 did not i weep for him that wa in troubl wa not my soul 
griev for the poor 30 26 when i look for good then evil came 
unto me and when i wait for light there came dark 

30 27 my bowel boil and rest not the day of afflict 
prevent me 

30 28 i went mourn without the sun i stood up and i cri in the 
congreg 

30 29 i am a brother to dragon and a companion to owl 

30 30 my skin is black upon me and my bone are burn with heat 

30 31 my harp also is turn to mourn and my organ into the voic 
of them that weep 

31 1 i made a coven with mine eye whi then should i think upon a 
maid 31 2 for what portion of god is there from abov and what 
inherit of the almighti from on high 31 3 is not destruct to 
the wick and a strang punish to the worker of iniqu 31 4 
doth not he see my way and count all my step 31 5 if i have 
walk with vaniti or if my foot hath hast to deceit 31 6 let me 
be weigh in an even balanc that god may know mine integr 

31 7 if my step hath turn out of the way and mine heart walk 
after mine eye and if ani blot hath cleav to mine hand 31 8 then 
let me sow and let anoth eat yea let my offspr be root out 

31 9 if mine heart have been deceiv by a woman or if i have laid 
wait at my neighbour s door 31 10 then let my wife grind unto 
anoth and let other bow down upon her 

31 11 for thi is an heinou crime yea it is an iniqu to be 
punish by the judg 

31 12 for it is a fire that consumeth to destruct and would root 
out all mine increa 

31 13 if i did despi the cau of my manserv or of my 
maidserv when they contend with me 31 14 what then shall i do 
when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him 
31 15 did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one 
fashion u in the womb 31 16 if i have withheld the poor from their 
desir or have cau the eye of the widow to fail 31 17 or have 
eaten my morsel myself alon and the fatherless hath not eaten 
thereof 31 18 for from my youth he wa brought up with me a with a 
father and i have guid her from my mother s womb 31 19 if i have 
seen ani perish for want of cloth or ani poor without cover 
31 20 if hi loin have not bless me and if he were not warm with 
the fleec of my sheep 31 21 if i have lift up my hand against the 
fatherless when i saw my help in the gate 31 22 then let mine arm 
fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone 

31 23 for destruct from god wa a terror to me and by reason of 
hi high i could not endur 

31 24 if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou 
art my confid 31 25 if i rejoic becau my wealth wa great and 
becau mine hand had gotten much 31 26 if i beheld the sun when it 
shine or the moon walk in bright 31 27 and my heart hath 
been secretli entic or my mouth hath kiss my hand 31 28 thi 
also were an iniqu to be punish by the judg for i should have 
deni the god that is abov 

31 29 if i rejoic at the destruct of him that hate me or lift 
up myself when evil found him 31 30 neither have i suffer my mouth 
to sin by wish a cur to hi soul 

31 31 if the men of my tabernacl said not oh that we had of hi 
flesh we cannot be satisfi 

31 32 the stranger did not lodg in the street but i open my door 
to the travel 

31 33 if i cover my transgress a adam by hide mine iniqu 
in my bosom 31 34 did i fear a great multitud or did the contempt 
of famili terrifi me that i kept silenc and went not out of the 
door 31 35 oh that one would hear me behold my desir is that the 
almighti would answer me and that mine adversari had written a book 

31 36 sure i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it a a crown 
to me 

31 37 i would declar unto him the number of my step a a princ 
would i go near unto him 

31 38 if my land cri against me or that the furrow likewi thereof 
complain 31 39 if i have eaten the fruit thereof without money or 
have cau the owner thereof to lose their life 31 40 let thistl 
grow instead of wheat and cockl instead of barley

buzit of the kindr of ram against job wa hi wrath kindl 
becau he justifi himself rather than god 

32 3 also against hi three friend wa hi wrath kindl becau 
they had found no answer and yet had condemn job 

32 4 now elihu had wait till job had spoken becau they were elder 
than he 

32 5 when elihu saw that there wa no answer in the mouth of these 
three men then hi wrath wa kindl 

32 6 and elihu the son of barachel the buzit answer and said i am 
young and ye are veri old wherefor i wa afraid and durst not shew 
you mine opinion 

32 7 i said day should speak and multitud of year should teach 
wisdom 

32 8 but there is a spirit in man and the inspir of the almighti 
giveth them understand 

32 9 great men are not alway wise neither do the age understand 
judgment 

32 10 therefor i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion 

32 11 behold i wait for your word i gave ear to your reason 
whilst ye search out what to say 

32 12 yea i attend unto you and behold there wa none of you 
that convinc job or that answer hi word 32 13 lest ye should 
say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man 

32 14 now he hath not direct hi word against me neither will i 
answer him with your speech 

32 15 they were amaz they answer no more they left off speak 

32 16 when i had wait for they spake not but stood still and 
answer no more 32 17 i said i will answer also my part i also 
will shew mine opinion

32 20 i will speak that i may be refresh i will open my lip and 
answer 

32 21 let me not i pray you accept ani man s person neither let me 
give flatter titl unto man 

32 22 for i know not to give flatter titl in so do my maker 
would soon take me away 

33 1 wherefor job i pray thee hear my speech and hearken to all 
my word 

33 2 behold now i have open my mouth my tongu hath spoken in my 
mouth 

33 3 my word shall be of the upright of my heart and my lip 
shall utter knowledg clearli 

33 4 the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighti 
hath given me life 

33 5 if thou canst answer me set thi word in order befor me stand 
up 

33 6 behold i am accord to thi wish in god s stead i also am 
form out of the clay 

33 7 behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my 
hand be heavi upon thee 

33 8 sure thou hast spoken in mine hear and i have heard the 
voic of thi word say 33 9 i am clean without transgress i 
am innoc neither is there iniqu in me 

33 10 behold he findeth occa against me he counteth me for hi 
enemi 33 11 he putteth my foot in the stock he marketh all my 
path 

33 12 behold in thi thou art not just i will answer thee that god 
is greater than man 

33 13 whi dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of 
ani of hi matter 

33 14 for god speaketh onc yea twice yet man perceiveth it not 

33 15 in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth 
upon men in slumber upon the bed 33 16 then he openeth the ear 
of men and sealeth their instruct 33 17 that he may withdraw man 
from hi purpo and hide pride from man 

33 18 he keepeth back hi soul from the pit and hi life from 
perish by the sword 

33 19 he is chasten also with pain upon hi bed and the multitud 
of hi bone with strong pain 33 20 so that hi life abhorreth bread 
and hi soul dainti meat 

33 21 hi flesh is consum away that it cannot be seen and hi 
bone that were not seen stick out 

33 22 yea hi soul draweth near unto the grave and hi life to the 
destroy 

33 23 if there be a messeng with him an interpret one among a 
thousand to shew unto man hi upright 33 24 then he is graciou 
unto him and saith deliv him from go down to the pit i have 
found a ransom 

33 25 hi flesh shall be fresher than a child s he shall return to 
the day of hi youth 33 26 he shall pray unto god and he will be 
favour unto him and he shall see hi face with joy for he will 
render unto man hi righteou 

33 27 he looketh upon men and if ani say i have sin and 
pervert that which wa right and it profit me not 33 28 he will 
deliv hi soul from go into the pit and hi life shall see the 
light 

33 29 lo all these thing worketh god oftentim with man 33 30 to 
bring back hi soul from the pit to be enlighten with the light of 
the live 

33 31 mark well o job hearken unto me hold thi peac and i will 
speak 

33 32 if thou hast anyth to say answer me speak for i desir to 
justifi thee 

33 33 if not hearken unto me hold thi peac and i shall teach thee 
wisdom 

34 1 furthermor elihu answer and said 34 2 hear my word o ye 
wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledg 

34 3 for the ear trieth word a the mouth tasteth meat 

34 4 let u choo to u judgment let u know among ourselv what is 
good 

34 5 for job hath said i am righteou and god hath taken away my 
judgment 

34 6 should i lie against my right my wound is incur without 
transgress 

34 7 what man is like job who drinketh up scorn like water 34 8 
which goeth in compani with the worker of iniqu and walketh with 
wick men 

34 9 for he hath said it profiteth a man noth that he should 
delight himself with god 

34 10 therefor hearken unto me ye men of understand far be it 
from god that he should do wick and from the almighti that he 
should commit iniqu 

34 11 for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cau everi 
man to find accord to hi way 

34 12 yea sure god will not do wickedli neither will the almighti 
pervert judgment 

34 13 who hath given him a charg over the earth or who hath dispo 
the whole world 34 14 if he set hi heart upon man if he gather 
unto himself hi spirit and hi breath 34 15 all flesh shall perish 
togeth and man shall turn again unto dust 

34 16 if now thou hast understand hear thi hearken to the voic 
of my word 

34 17 shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn 
him that is most just 34 18 is it fit to say to a king thou art 
wick and to princ ye are ungodli 34 19 how much le to him 
that accepteth not the person of princ nor regardeth the rich more 
than the poor for they all are the work of hi hand 

34 20 in a moment shall they die and the peopl shall be troubl at 
midnight and pa away and the mighti shall be taken away without 
hand 

34 21 for hi eye are upon the way of man and he seeth all hi 
go 

34 22 there is no dark nor shadow of death where the worker of 
iniqu may hide themselv 

34 23 for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should 
enter into judgment with god 

34 24 he shall break in piec mighti men without number and set 
other in their stead 

34 25 therefor he knoweth their work and he overturneth them in the 
night so that they are destroy 

34 26 he striketh them a wick men in the open sight of other 
34 27 becau they turn back from him and would not consid ani of 
hi way 34 28 so that they cau the cri of the poor to come unto 
him and he heareth the cri of the afflict 

34 29 when he giveth quiet who then can make troubl and when he 
hideth hi face who then can behold him whether it be done against a 
nation or against a man onli 34 30 that the hypocrit reign not 
lest the peopl be ensnar 

34 31 sure it is meet to be said unto god i have born 
chasti i will not offend ani more 34 32 that which i see not 
teach thou me if i have done iniqu i will do no more 

34 33 should it be accord to thi mind he will recompen it 
whether thou refu or whether thou choo and not i therefor 
speak what thou knowest 

34 34 let men of understand tell me and let a wise man hearken 
unto me 

34 35 job hath spoken without knowledg and hi word were without 
wisdom 

34 36 my desir is that job may be tri unto the end becau of hi 
answer for wick men 

34 37 for he addeth rebellion unto hi sin he clappeth hi hand 
among u and multiplieth hi word against god 

35 1 elihu spake moreov and said 35 2 thinkest thou thi to be 
right that thou saidst my righteou is more than god s 35 3 
for thou saidst what advantag will it be unto thee and what profit 
shall i have if i be clean from my sin 35 4 i will answer thee 
and thi companion with thee 

35 5 look unto the heaven and see and behold the cloud which are 
higher than thou 

35 6 if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thi 
transgress be multipli what doest thou unto him 35 7 if thou 
be righteou what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine 
hand 35 8 thi wick may hurt a man a thou art and thi 
righteou may profit the son of man 

35 9 by reason of the multitud of oppress they make the oppress 
to cri they cri out by reason of the arm of the mighti 

35 10 but none saith where is god my maker who giveth song in the 
night 35 11 who teacheth u more than the beast of the earth and 
maketh u wiser than the fowl of heaven 35 12 there they cri but 
none giveth answer becau of the pride of evil men 

35 13 sure god will not hear vaniti neither will the almighti 
regard it 

35 14 although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is 
befor him therefor trust thou in him 

35 15 but now becau it is not so he hath visit in hi anger yet 
he knoweth it not in great extrem 35 16 therefor doth job open 
hi mouth in vain he multiplieth word without knowledg 

36 1 elihu also proceed and said 36 2 suffer me a littl and i 
will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god s behalf 

36 3 i will fetch my knowledg from afar and will ascrib 
righteou to my maker 

36 4 for truli my word shall not be fal he that is perfect in 
knowledg is with thee 

36 5 behold god is mighti and despiseth not ani he is mighti in 
strength and wisdom 

36 6 he preserveth not the life of the wick but giveth right to the 
poor 

36 7 he withdraweth not hi eye from the righteou but with king 
are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they 
are exalt 

36 8 and if they be bound in fetter and be holden in cord of 
afflict 36 9 then he sheweth them their work and their 
transgress that they have exceed 

36 10 he openeth also their ear to disciplin and commandeth that 
they return from iniqu 

36 11 if they obey and serv him they shall spend their day in 
prosper and their year in pleasur 

36 12 but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they 
shall die without knowledg 

36 13 but the hypocrit in heart heap up wrath they cri not when he 
bindeth them 

36 14 they die in youth and their life is among the unclean 

36 15 he delivereth the poor in hi afflict and openeth their ear 
in oppress 

36 16 even so would he have remov thee out of the strait into a 
broad place where there is no strait and that which should be 
set on thi tabl should be full of fat 

36 17 but thou hast fulfil the judgment of the wick judgment and 
justic take hold on thee 

36 18 becau there is wrath bewar lest he take thee away with hi 
stroke then a great ransom cannot deliv thee 

36 19 will he esteem thi rich no not gold nor all the forc of 
strength 

36 20 desir not the night when peopl are cut off in their place 

36 21 take heed regard not iniqu for thi hast thou chosen rather 
than afflict 

36 22 behold god exalteth by hi power who teacheth like him 36 23 
who hath enjoin him hi way or who can say thou hast wrought 
iniqu 36 24 rememb that thou magnifi hi work which men 
behold 

36 25 everi man may see it man may behold it afar off 

36 26 behold god is great and we know him not neither can the 
number of hi year be search out 

36 27 for he maketh small the drop of water they pour down rain 
accord to the vapour thereof 36 28 which the cloud do drop and 
distil upon man abundantli 

36 29 also can ani understand the spread of the cloud or the 
noi of hi tabernacl 36 30 behold he spreadeth hi light upon 
it and covereth the bottom of the sea 

36 31 for by them judgeth he the peopl he giveth meat in abund 

36 32 with cloud he covereth the light and commandeth it not to 
shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt 

36 33 the noi thereof sheweth concern it the cattl also 
concern the vapour 

37 1 at thi also my heart trembleth and is move out of hi place 

37 2 hear attent the noi of hi voic and the sound that goeth 
out of hi mouth 

37 3 he directeth it under the whole heaven and hi lightn unto 
the end of the earth 

37 4 after it a voic roareth he thundereth with the voic of hi 
excel and he will not stay them when hi voic is heard 

37 5 god thundereth marvel with hi voic great thing doeth 
he which we cannot comprehend 

37 6 for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewi to the 
small rain and to the great rain of hi strength 

37 7 he sealeth up the hand of everi man that all men may know hi 
work 

37 8 then the beast go into den and remain in their place 

37 9 out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north 

37 10 by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the 
water is straiten 

37 11 also by water he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth hi 
bright cloud 37 12 and it is turn round about by hi counsel that 
they may do whatsoev he commandeth them upon the face of the world 
in the earth 

37 13 he causeth it to come whether for correct or for hi land 
or for merci 

37 14 hearken unto thi o job stand still and consid the wondrou 
work of god 

37 15 dost thou know when god dispo them and cau the light of 
hi cloud to shine 37 16 dost thou know the balanc of the 
cloud the wondrou work of him which is perfect in knowledg 
37 17 how thi garment are warm when he quieteth the earth by the 
south wind 37 18 hast thou with him spread out the sky which is 
strong and a a molten look glass 37 19 teach u what we shall 
say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of dark 

37 20 shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak sure he 
shall be swallow up 

37 21 and now men see not the bright light which is in the cloud but 
the wind passeth and cleanseth them 

37 22 fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terribl 
majesti 

37 23 touch the almighti we cannot find him out he is excel 
in power and in judgment and in plenti of justic he will not 
afflict 

37 24 men do therefor fear him he respecteth not ani that are wise 
of heart 

38 1 then the lord answer job out of the whirlwind and said 38 2 
who is thi that darkeneth counsel by word without knowledg 38 3 
gird up now thi loin like a man for i will demand of thee and 
answer thou me

38 8 or who shut up the sea with door when it brake forth a if it 
had issu out of the womb 38 9 when i made the cloud the garment 
thereof and thick dark a swaddlingband for it 38 10 and brake up

hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thi proud 
wave be stay 38 12 hast thou command the morn sinc thi 
day and cau the dayspr to know hi place 38 13 that it might 
take hold of the end of the earth that the wick might be shaken 
out of it 38 14 it is turn a clay to the seal and they stand a 
a garment 

38 15 and from the wick their light is withholden and the high arm 
shall be broken 

38 16 hast thou enter into the spring of the sea or hast thou

38 18 hast thou perceiv the breadth of the earth declar if thou 
knowest it all

bringeth forth hi fruit in hi season hi leaf also shall not 
wither and whatsoev he doeth shall prosper

driveth away

with a light of fire 

78 15 he clave the rock in the wilder and gave them drink a out 
of the great depth 

78 16 he brought stream also out of the rock and cau water to

righteou and condemn the innoc blood 

94 22 but the lord is my defenc and my god is the rock of my refug 

94 23 and he shall bring upon them their own iniqu and shall cut

the proverb 


1 1 the proverb of solomon the son of david king of israel 1 2 to 
know wisdom and instruct to perceiv the word of understand 
1 3 to receiv the instruct of wisdom justic and judgment and 
equiti 1 4 to give subtilti to the simpl to the young man knowledg 
and discret 

1 5 a wise man will hear and will increa learn and a man of 
understand shall attain unto wise counsel 1 6 to understand a 
proverb and the interpret the word of the wise and their dark 
say 

1 7 the fear of the lord is the begin of knowledg but fool 
despi wisdom and instruct 

1 8 my son hear the instruct of thi father and forsak not the 
law of thi mother 1 9 for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thi 
head and chain about thi neck 

1 10 my son if sinner entic thee consent thou not 

1 11 if they say come with u let u lay wait for blood let u lurk 
privili for the innoc without cau 1 12 let u swallow them up 
aliv a the grave and whole a those that go down into the pit 
1 13 we shall find all preciou substanc we shall fill our hou 
with spoil 1 14 cast in thi lot among u let u all have one pur 
1 15 my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thi foot from 
their path 1 16 for their foot run to evil and make hast to shed 
blood 

1 17 sure in vain the net is spread in the sight of ani bird 

1 18 and they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privili for 
their own life 

1 19 so are the way of everi one that is greedi of gain which taketh 
away the life of the owner thereof 

1 20 wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voic in the street 
1 21 she crieth in the chief place of concour in the open of 
the gate in the citi she uttereth her word say 1 22 how long 
ye simpl one will ye love simplic and the scorner delight in 
their scorn and fool hate knowledg 1 23 turn you at my 
reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known 
my word unto you 

1 24 becau i have call and ye refu i have stretch out my 
hand and no man regard 1 25 but ye have set at nought all my 
counsel and would none of my reproof 1 26 i also will laugh at your 
calam i will mock when your fear cometh 1 27 when your fear 
cometh a desol and your destruct cometh a a whirlwind when 
distress and anguish cometh upon you 

1 28 then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall 
seek me earli but they shall not find me 1 29 for that they hate 
knowledg and did not choo the fear of the lord 1 30 they would 
none of my counsel they despi all my reproof 

1 31 therefor shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be 
fill with their own devic 

1 32 for the turn away of the simpl shall slay them and the 
prosper of fool shall destroy them 

1 33 but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safe and shall be 
quiet from fear of evil 

2 1 my son if thou wilt receiv my word and hide my command 
with thee 2 2 so that thou inclin thine ear unto wisdom and appli 
thine heart to understand 2 3 yea if thou criest after knowledg 
and liftest up thi voic for understand 2 4 if thou seekest her a 
silver and searchest for her a for hid treasur 2 5 then shalt 
thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledg of god 

2 6 for the lord giveth wisdom out of hi mouth cometh knowledg and 
understand 

2 7 he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteou he is a buckler to 
them that walk uprightli 

2 8 he keepeth the path of judgment and preserveth the way of hi 
saint 

2 9 then shalt thou understand righteou and judgment and 
equiti yea everi good path 

2 10 when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledg is pleasant 
unto thi soul 2 11 discret shall preserv thee understand 
shall keep thee 2 12 to deliv thee from the way of the evil man 
from the man that speaketh froward thing 2 13 who leav the path of 
upright to walk in the way of dark 2 14 who rejoic to do 
evil and delight in the froward of the wick 2 15 whose way 
are crook and they froward in their path 2 16 to deliv thee 
from the strang woman even from the stranger which flattereth with 
her word 2 17 which forsaketh the guid of her youth and forgetteth 
the coven of her god 

2 18 for her hou inclineth unto death and her path unto the dead 

2 19 none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the 
path of life 

2 20 that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the path 
of the righteou 

2 21 for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall 
remain in it 

2 22 but the wick shall be cut off from the earth and the 
transgressor shall be root out of it 

3 1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my 
command 3 2 for length of day and long life and peac shall 
they add to thee 

3 3 let not merci and truth forsak thee bind them about thi neck 
write them upon the tabl of thine heart 3 4 so shalt thou find 
favour and good understand in the sight of god and man 

3 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine 
own understand 

3 6 in all thi way acknowledg him and he shall direct thi path 

3 7 be not wise in thine own eye fear the lord and depart from 
evil 

3 8 it shall be health to thi navel and marrow to thi bone 

3 9 honour the lord with thi substanc and with the firstfruit of 
all thine increa 3 10 so shall thi barn be fill with plenti and 
thi press shall burst out with new wine 

3 11 my son despi not the chasten of the lord neither be weari 
of hi correct 3 12 for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even 
a a father the son in whom he delighteth 

3 13 happi is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth 
understand 

3 14 for the merchandi of it is better than the merchandi of 
silver and the gain thereof than fine gold 

3 15 she is more preciou than rubi and all the thing thou canst 
desir are not to be compar unto her 

3 16 length of day is in her right hand and in her left hand rich 
and honour 

3 17 her way are way of pleasant and all her path are peac 

3 18 she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happi 
is everi one that retaineth her 

3 19 the lord by wisdom hath found the earth by understand hath 
he establish the heaven 

3 20 by hi knowledg the depth are broken up and the cloud drop 
down the dew 

3 21 my son let not them depart from thine eye keep sound wisdom 
and discret 3 22 so shall they be life unto thi soul and grace to 
thi neck 

3 23 then shalt thou walk in thi way safe and thi foot shall not 
stumbl 

3 24 when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt 
lie down and thi sleep shall be sweet 

3 25 be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desol of the 
wick when it cometh 

3 26 for the lord shall be thi confid and shall keep thi foot 
from be taken 

3 27 withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the 
power of thine hand to do it 

3 28 say not unto thi neighbour go and come again and to morrow i 
will give when thou hast it by thee 

3 29 devi not evil against thi neighbour see he dwelleth 
secur by thee 

3 30 strive not with a man without cau if he have done thee no 
harm 

3 31 envi thou not the oppressor and choo none of hi way 

3 32 for the froward is abomin to the lord but hi secret is 
with the righteou 

3 33 the cur of the lord is in the hou of the wick but he 
blesseth the habit of the just 

3 34 sure he scorneth the scorner but he giveth grace unto the 
lowli 

3 35 the wise shall inherit glori but shame shall be the promot of 
fool 

4 1 hear ye child the instruct of a father and attend to know

runnest thou shalt not stumbl 

4 13 take fast hold of instruct let her not go keep her for she 
is thi life 

4 14 enter not into the path of the wick and go not in the way of 
evil men 

4 15 avoid it pa not by it turn from it and pa away 

4 16 for they sleep not except they have done mischief and their 
sleep is taken away unless they cau some to fall 

4 17 for they eat the bread of wick and drink the wine of 
violenc 

4 18 but the path of the just is a the shine light that shineth 
more and more unto the perfect day 

4 19 the way of the wick is a dark they know not at what they 
stumbl 

4 20 my son attend to my word inclin thine ear unto my say 

4 21 let them not depart from thine eye keep them in the midst of 
thine heart

of life 

4 24 put away from thee a froward mouth and perver lip put far 
from thee

mouth is smoother than oil 5 4 but her end is bitter a wormwood 
sharp a a two edg sword 

5 5 her foot go down to death her step take hold on hell 

5 6 lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her way are 
moveabl that thou canst not know them 

5 7 hear me now therefor o ye child and depart not from the 
word of my mouth

labour be in the hou of a stranger 5 11 and thou mourn at the 
last when thi flesh and thi bodi are consum 5 12 and say how have 
i hate instruct and my heart despi reproof 5 13 and have not 
obey the voic of my teacher nor inclin mine ear to them that 
instruct me 5 14 i wa almost in all evil in the midst of the 
congreg and assembl 

5 15 drink water out of thine own cistern and run water out of 
thine own well 

5 16 let thi fountain be disper abroad and river of water in 
the street 

5 17 let them be onli thine own and not stranger with thee 

5 18 let thi fountain be bless and rejoic with the wife of thi 
youth 

5 19 let her be a the love hind and pleasant roe let her breast 
satisfi thee at all time and be thou ravish alway with her love 

5 20 and whi wilt thou my son be ravish with a strang woman and 
embrac the bosom of a stranger 5 21 for the way of man are befor 
the eye of the lord and he pondereth all hi go 

5 22 hi own iniqu shall take the wick himself and he shall be 
holden with the cord of hi sin 

5 23 he shall die without instruct and in the great of hi 
folli he shall go astray 

6 1 my son if thou be sureti for thi friend if thou hast stricken 
thi hand with a stranger 6 2 thou art snare with the word of thi 
mouth thou art taken with the word of thi mouth 

6 3 do thi now my son and deliv thyself when thou art come into 
the hand of thi friend go humbl thyself and make sure thi friend 

6 4 give not sleep to thine eye nor slumber to thine eyelid 

6 5 deliv thyself a a roe from the hand of the hunter and a a 
bird from the hand of the fowler 

6 6 go to the ant thou sluggard consid her way and be wise 6 7 
which have no guid over or ruler 6 8 provideth her meat in 
the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest 

6 9 how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou ari out of 
thi sleep 6 10 yet a littl sleep a littl slumber a littl 
fold of the hand to sleep 6 11 so shall thi poverti come a one 
that travelleth and thi want a an arm man 

6 12 a naughti person a wick man walketh with a froward mouth 

6 13 he winketh with hi eye he speaketh with hi foot he teacheth 
with hi finger 6 14 froward is in hi heart he deviseth 
mischief continu he soweth discord 

6 15 therefor shall hi calam come suddenli suddenli shall he be 
broken without remedi 

6 16 these six thing doth the lord hate yea seven are an 
abomin unto him 6 17 a proud look a lie tongu and hand 
that shed innoc blood 6 18 an heart that deviseth wick 
imagin foot that be swift in run to mischief 6 19 a fal 
wit that speaketh lie and he that soweth discord among brother 

6 20 my son keep thi father s command and forsak not the law of 
thi mother 6 21 bind them continu upon thine heart and tie them 
about thi neck 

6 22 when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall 
keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee 

6 23 for the command is a lamp and the law is light and reproof 
of instruct are the way of life 6 24 to keep thee from the evil 
woman from the flatteri of the tongu of a strang woman 

6 25 lust not after her beauti in thine heart neither let her take 
thee with her eyelid 

6 26 for by mean of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piec of 
bread and the adultress will hunt for the preciou life 

6 27 can a man take fire in hi bosom and hi cloth not be burn 
6 28 can one go upon hot coal and hi foot not be burn 6 29 so 
he that goeth in to hi neighbour s wife whosoev toucheth her shall 
not be innoc 

6 30 men do not despi a thief if he steal to satisfi hi soul when 
he is hungri 6 31 but if he be found he shall restor sevenfold he 
shall give all the substanc of hi hou 

6 32 but whoso committeth adulteri with a woman lacketh understand 
he that doeth it destroyeth hi own soul 

6 33 a wound and dishonour shall he get and hi reproach shall not be 
wipe away 

6 34 for jealousi is the rage of a man therefor he will not spare in 
the day of vengeanc 

6 35 he will not regard ani ransom neither will he rest content 
though thou givest mani gift 

7 1 my son keep my word and lay up my command with thee 

7 2 keep my command and live and my law a the appl of thine 
eye 

7 3 bind them upon thi finger write them upon the tabl of thine 
heart 

7 4 say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understand thi 
kinswoman 7 5 that they may keep thee from the strang woman from 
the stranger which flattereth with her word 

7 6 for at the window of my hou i look through my casement 7 7 
and beheld among the simpl one i discern among the youth a 
young man void of understand 7 8 pa through the street near 
her corner and he went the way to her hou 7 9 in the twilight in

7 11 she is loud and stubborn her foot abid not in her hou 7 12

7 18 come let u take our fill of love until the morn let u 
solac ourselv with love 

7 19 for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey 7 20 
he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day

7 21 with her much fair speech she cau him to yield with the 
flatter of her lip she forc him 

7 22 he goeth after her straightway a an ox goeth to the slaughter 
or a a fool to the correct of the stock 7 23 till a dart strike 
through hi liver a a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not 
that it is for hi life 

7 24 hearken unto me now therefor o ye child and attend to the 
word of my mouth 

7 25 let not thine heart declin to her way go not astray in her

death 

8 1 doth not wisdom cri and understand put forth her voic 8 2 
she standeth in the top of high place by the way in the place of

8 13 the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrog and

8 20 i lead in the way of righteou in the midst of the path of 
judgment 8 21 that i may cau those that love me to inherit 
substanc and i will fill their treasur 

8 22 the lord poss me in the begin of hi way befor hi

nor the highest part of the dust of the world 

8 27 when he prepar the heaven i wa there when he set a compass 
upon the face of the depth 8 28 when he establish the cloud abov 
when he strengthen the fountain of the deep 8 29 when he gave to 
the sea hi decr that the water should not pa hi command

wait at the post of my door 

8 35 for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the 
lord 

8 36 but he that sinneth against me wrongeth hi own soul all they 
that hate me love death 

9 1 wisdom hath build her hou she hath hewn out her seven 
pillar 9 2 she hath kill her beast she hath mingl her wine 
she hath also furnish her tabl 

9 3 she hath sent forth her maiden she crieth upon the highest 
place of the citi 9 4 whoso is simpl let him turn in hither a 
for him that wanteth understand she saith to him 9 5 come eat of 
my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingl 

9 6 forsak the foolish and live and go in the way of understand 

9 7 he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that 
rebuketh a wick man getteth himself a blot 

9 8 reprov not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuk a wise man and 
he will love thee 

9 9 give instruct to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a 
just man and he will increa in learn 

9 10 the fear of the lord is the begin of wisdom and the 
knowledg of the holi is understand 

9 11 for by me thi day shall be multipli and the year of thi life 
shall be increa 

9 12 if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou 
scornest thou alon shalt bear it 

9 13 a foolish woman is clamor she is simpl and knoweth noth 

9 14 for she sitteth at the door of her hou on a seat in the high 
place of the citi 9 15 to call passeng who go right on their 
way 9 16 whoso is simpl let him turn in hither and a for him 
that wanteth understand she saith to him 9 17 stolen water are 
sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant 

9 18 but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guest 
are in the depth of hell 

10 1 the proverb of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but a 
foolish son is the heavi of hi mother 

10 2 treasur of wick profit noth but righteou 
delivereth from death 

10 3 the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteou to famish but 
he casteth away the substanc of the wick 

10 4 he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of 
the dilig maketh rich 

10 5 he that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth 
in harvest is a son that causeth shame 

10 6 bless are upon the head of the just but violenc covereth 
the mouth of the wick 

10 7 the memori of the just is bless but the name of the wick 
shall rot 

10 8 the wise in heart will receiv command but a prate fool 
shall fall 

10 9 he that walketh uprightli walketh sure but he that perverteth 
hi way shall be known 

10 10 he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prate fool 
shall fall 

10 11 the mouth of a righteou man is a well of life but violenc 
covereth the mouth of the wick 

10 12 hatr stirreth up strife but love covereth all sin 

10 13 in the lip of him that hath understand wisdom is found but 
a rod is for the back of him that is void of understand 

10 14 wise men lay up knowledg but the mouth of the foolish is near 
destruct 

10 15 the rich man s wealth is hi strong citi the destruct of the 
poor is their poverti 

10 16 the labour of the righteou tendeth to life the fruit of the 
wick to sin 

10 17 he is in the way of life that keepeth instruct but he that 
refuseth reproof erreth 

10 18 he that hideth hatr with lie lip and he that uttereth a 
slander is a fool 

10 19 in the multitud of word there wanteth not sin but he that 
refraineth hi lip is wise 

10 20 the tongu of the just is a choic silver the heart of the 
wick is littl worth 

10 21 the lip of the righteou feed mani but fool die for want of 
wisdom 

10 22 the bless of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no 
sorrow with it 

10 23 it is a sport to a fool to do mischief but a man of 
understand hath wisdom 

10 24 the fear of the wick it shall come upon him but the desir 
of the righteou shall be grant 

10 25 a the whirlwind passeth so is the wick no more but the 
righteou is an everlast foundat 

10 26 a vinegar to the teeth and a smoke to the eye so is the 
sluggard to them that send him 

10 27 the fear of the lord prolongeth day but the year of the 
wick shall be shorten 

10 28 the hope of the righteou shall be glad but the expect 
of the wick shall perish 

10 29 the way of the lord is strength to the upright but destruct 
shall be to the worker of iniqu 

10 30 the righteou shall never be remov but the wick shall not 
inhabit the earth 

10 31 the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom but the froward 
tongu shall be cut out 

10 32 the lip of the righteou know what is accept but the mouth 
of the wick speaketh froward 

11 1 a fal balanc is abomin to the lord but a just weight is 
hi delight 

11 2 when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowli is 
wisdom 

11 3 the integr of the upright shall guid them but the 
perver of transgressor shall destroy them 

11 4 rich profit not in the day of wrath but righteou 
delivereth from death 

11 5 the righteou of the perfect shall direct hi way but the 
wick shall fall by hi own wick 

11 6 the righteou of the upright shall deliv them but 
transgressor shall be taken in their own naughti 

11 7 when a wick man dieth hi expect shall perish and the 
hope of unjust men perisheth 

11 8 the righteou is deliv out of troubl and the wick cometh 
in hi stead 

11 9 an hypocrit with hi mouth destroyeth hi neighbour but through 
knowledg shall the just be deliv 

11 10 when it goeth well with the righteou the citi rejoiceth and 
when the wick perish there is shout 

11 11 by the bless of the upright the citi is exalt but it is 
overthrown by the mouth of the wick 

11 12 he that is void of wisdom despiseth hi neighbour but a man of 
understand holdeth hi peac 

11 13 a talebear revealeth secret but he that is of a faith 
spirit concealeth the matter 

11 14 where no counsel is the peopl fall but in the multitud of 
counsellor there is safeti 

11 15 he that is sureti for a stranger shall smart for it and he that 
hateth suretiship is sure 

11 16 a graciou woman retaineth honour and strong men retain rich 

11 17 the merci man doeth good to hi own soul but he that is 
cruel troubleth hi own flesh 

11 18 the wick worketh a deceit work but to him that soweth 
righteou shall be a sure reward 

11 19 a righteou tendeth to life so he that pursueth evil 
pursueth it to hi own death 

11 20 they that are of a froward heart are abomin to the lord 
but such a are upright in their way are hi delight 

11 21 though hand join in hand the wick shall not be unpunish 
but the seed of the righteou shall be deliv 

11 22 a a jewel of gold in a swine s snout so is a fair woman which 
is without discret 

11 23 the desir of the righteou is onli good but the expect of 
the wick is wrath 

11 24 there is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that 
withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverti 

11 25 the liber soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall 
be water also himself 

11 26 he that withholdeth corn the peopl shall cur him but 
bless shall be upon the head of him that selleth it 

11 27 he that dilig seeketh good procureth favour but he that 
seeketh mischief it shall come unto him 

11 28 he that trusteth in hi rich shall fall but the righteou 
shall flourish a a branch 

11 29 he that troubleth hi own hou shall inherit the wind and the 
fool shall be servant to the wise of heart 

11 30 the fruit of the righteou is a tree of life and he that 
winneth soul is wise 

11 31 behold the righteou shall be recompen in the earth much 
more the wick and the sinner 

12 1 whoso loveth instruct loveth knowledg but he that hateth 
reproof is brutish 

12 2 a good man obtaineth favour of the lord but a man of wick 
devic will he condemn 

12 3 a man shall not be establish by wick but the root of the 
righteou shall not be move 

12 4 a virtuou woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh 
asham is a rotten in hi bone 

12 5 the thought of the righteou are right but the counsel of the 
wick are deceit 

12 6 the word of the wick are to lie in wait for blood but the 
mouth of the upright shall deliv them 

12 7 the wick are overthrown and are not but the hou of the 
righteou shall stand 

12 8 a man shall be commend accord to hi wisdom but he that is 
of a perver heart shall be despi 

12 9 he that is despi and hath a servant is better than he that 
honoureth himself and lacketh bread 

12 10 a righteou man regardeth the life of hi beast but the tender 
merci of the wick are cruel 

12 11 he that tilleth hi land shall be satisfi with bread but he 
that followeth vain person is void of understand 

12 12 the wick desireth the net of evil men but the root of the 
righteou yieldeth fruit 

12 13 the wick is snare by the transgress of hi lip but the 
just shall come out of troubl 

12 14 a man shall be satisfi with good by the fruit of hi mouth 
and the recomp of a man s hand shall be render unto him 

12 15 the way of a fool is right in hi own eye but he that 
hearkeneth unto counsel is wise 

12 16 a fool s wrath is present known but a prudent man covereth 
shame 

12 17 he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteou but a fal 
wit deceit 

12 18 there is that speaketh like the pierc of a sword but the 
tongu of the wise is health 

12 19 the lip of truth shall be establish for ever but a lie 
tongu is but for a moment 

12 20 deceit is in the heart of them that imagin evil but to the 
counsellor of peac is joy 

12 21 there shall no evil happen to the just but the wick shall be 
fill with mischief 

12 22 lie lip are abomin to the lord but they that deal truli 
are hi delight 

12 23 a prudent man concealeth knowledg but the heart of fool 
proclaimeth foolish 

12 24 the hand of the dilig shall bear rule but the sloth shall 
be under tribut 

12 25 heavi in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word 
maketh it glad 

12 26 the righteou is more excel than hi neighbour but the way 
of the wick seduceth them 

12 27 the sloth man roasteth not that which he took in hunt but 
the substanc of a dilig man is preciou 

12 28 in the way of righteou is life and in the pathway thereof 
there is no death 

13 1 a wise son heareth hi father s instruct but a scorner 
heareth not rebuk 

13 2 a man shall eat good by the fruit of hi mouth but the soul of 
the transgressor shall eat violenc 

13 3 he that keepeth hi mouth keepeth hi life but he that openeth 
wide hi lip shall have destruct 

13 4 the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath noth but the soul 
of the dilig shall be made fat 

13 5 a righteou man hateth lie but a wick man is loathsom and 
cometh to shame 

13 6 righteou keepeth him that is upright in the way but 
wick overthroweth the sinner 

13 7 there is that maketh himself rich yet hath noth there is 
that maketh himself poor yet hath great rich 

13 8 the ransom of a man s life are hi rich but the poor heareth 
not rebuk 

13 9 the light of the righteou rejoiceth but the lamp of the wick 
shall be put out 

13 10 onli by pride cometh content but with the well advi is 
wisdom 

13 11 wealth gotten by vaniti shall be diminish but he that 
gathereth by labour shall increa 

13 12 hope defer maketh the heart sick but when the desir cometh 
it is a tree of life 

13 13 whoso despiseth the word shall be destroy but he that feareth 
the command shall be reward 

13 14 the law of the wise is a fountain of life to depart from the 
snare of death 

13 15 good understand giveth favour but the way of transgressor 
is hard 

13 16 everi prudent man dealeth with knowledg but a fool layeth open 
hi folli 

13 17 a wick messeng falleth into mischief but a faith 
ambassador is health 

13 18 poverti and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruct but 
he that regardeth reproof shall be honour 

13 19 the desir accomplish is sweet to the soul but it is 
abomin to fool to depart from evil 

13 20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of 
fool shall be destroy 

13 21 evil pursueth sinner but to the righteou good shall be 
repay 

13 22 a good man leaveth an inherit to hi child s child 
and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just 

13 23 much food is in the tillag of the poor but there is that is 
destroy for want of judgment 

13 24 he that spareth hi rod hateth hi son but he that loveth him 
chasteneth him betim 

13 25 the righteou eateth to the satisfi of hi soul but the 
belli of the wick shall want 

14 1 everi wise woman buildeth her hou but the foolish plucketh it 
down with her hand 

14 2 he that walketh in hi upright feareth the lord but he that 
is perver in hi way despiseth him 

14 3 in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lip of 
the wise shall preserv them 

14 4 where no ox are the crib is clean but much increa is by the 
strength of the ox 

14 5 a faith wit will not lie but a fal wit will utter 
lie 

14 6 a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledg is 
easi unto him that understandeth 

14 7 go from the presenc of a foolish man when thou perceivest not 
in him the lip of knowledg 

14 8 the wisdom of the prudent is to understand hi way but the folli 
of fool is deceit 

14 9 fool make a mock at sin but among the righteou there is 
favour 

14 10 the heart knoweth hi own bitter and a stranger doth not 
intermeddl with hi joy 

14 11 the hou of the wick shall be overthrown but the tabernacl 
of the upright shall flourish 

14 12 there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end 
thereof are the way of death 

14 13 even in laughter the heart is sorrow and the end of that 
mirth is heavi 

14 14 the backslid in heart shall be fill with hi own way and a 
good man shall be satisfi from himself 

14 15 the simpl believeth everi word but the prudent man looketh 
well to hi go 

14 16 a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool 
rageth and is confid 

14 17 he that is soon angri dealeth foolishli and a man of wick 
devic is hate 

14 18 the simpl inherit folli but the prudent are crown with 
knowledg 

14 19 the evil bow befor the good and the wick at the gate of the 
righteou 

14 20 the poor is hate even of hi own neighbour but the rich hath 
mani friend 

14 21 he that despiseth hi neighbour sinneth but he that hath merci 
on the poor happi is he 

14 22 do they not err that devi evil but merci and truth shall be 
to them that devi good 

14 23 in all labour there is profit but the talk of the lip tendeth 
onli to penuri 

14 24 the crown of the wise is their rich but the foolish of 
fool is folli 

14 25 a true wit delivereth soul but a deceit wit 
speaketh lie 

14 26 in the fear of the lord is strong confid and hi child 
shall have a place of refug 

14 27 the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to depart from the 
snare of death 

14 28 in the multitud of peopl is the king s honour but in the want 
of peopl is the destruct of the princ 

14 29 he that is slow to wrath is of great understand but he that 
is hasti of spirit exalteth folli 

14 30 a sound heart is the life of the flesh but envi the rotten 
of the bone 

14 31 he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth hi maker but he that 
honoureth him hath merci on the poor 

14 32 the wick is driven away in hi wick but the righteou 
hath hope in hi death 

14 33 wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understand but 
that which is in the midst of fool is made known 

14 34 righteou exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to ani 
peopl 

14 35 the king s favour is toward a wise servant but hi wrath is 
against him that causeth shame 

15 1 a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievou word stir up 
anger 

15 2 the tongu of the wise useth knowledg aright but the mouth of 
fool poureth out foolish 

15 3 the eye of the lord are in everi place behold the evil and 
the good 

15 4 a wholesom tongu is a tree of life but perver therein is 
a breach in the spirit 

15 5 a fool despiseth hi father s instruct but he that regardeth 
reproof is prudent 

15 6 in the hou of the righteou is much treasur but in the 
revenu of the wick is troubl 

15 7 the lip of the wise disper knowledg but the heart of the 
foolish doeth not so 

15 8 the sacrif of the wick is an abomin to the lord but 
the prayer of the upright is hi delight 

15 9 the way of the wick is an abomin unto the lord but he 
loveth him that followeth after righteou 

15 10 correct is grievou unto him that forsaketh the way and he 
that hateth reproof shall die 

15 11 hell and destruct are befor the lord how much more then the 
heart of the child of men 15 12 a scorner loveth not one that 
reproveth him neither will he go unto the wise 

15 13 a merri heart maketh a cheer counten but by sorrow of 
the heart the spirit is broken 

15 14 the heart of him that hath understand seeketh knowledg but 
the mouth of fool feedeth on foolish 

15 15 all the day of the afflict are evil but he that is of a 
merri heart hath a continu feast 

15 16 better is littl with the fear of the lord than great treasur 
and troubl therewith 

15 17 better is a dinner of herb where love is than a stall ox and 
hatr therewith 

15 18 a wrath man stirreth up strife but he that is slow to anger 
appeaseth strife 

15 19 the way of the sloth man is a an hedg of thorn but the 
way of the righteou is made plain 

15 20 a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth hi 
mother 

15 21 folli is joy to him that is destitut of wisdom but a man of 
understand walketh uprightli 

15 22 without counsel purpo are disappoint but in the multitud 
of counsellor they are establish 

15 23 a man hath joy by the answer of hi mouth and a word spoken in 
due season how good is it 15 24 the way of life is abov to the 
wise that he may depart from hell beneath 

15 25 the lord will destroy the hou of the proud but he will 
establish the border of the widow 

15 26 the thought of the wick are an abomin to the lord but 
the word of the pure are pleasant word 

15 27 he that is greedi of gain troubleth hi own hou but he that 
hateth gift shall live 

15 28 the heart of the righteou studieth to answer but the mouth of 
the wick poureth out evil thing 

15 29 the lord is far from the wick but he heareth the prayer of 
the righteou 

15 30 the light of the eye rejoiceth the heart and a good report 
maketh the bone fat 

15 31 the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise 

15 32 he that refuseth instruct despiseth hi own soul but he that 
heareth reproof getteth understand 

15 33 the fear of the lord is the instruct of wisdom and befor 
honour is humil 

16 1 the prepar of the heart in man and the answer of the 
tongu is from the lord 

16 2 all the way of a man are clean in hi own eye but the lord 
weigheth the spirit 

16 3 commit thi work unto the lord and thi thought shall be 
establish 

16 4 the lord hath made all thing for himself yea even the wick 
for the day of evil 

16 5 everi one that is proud in heart is an abomin to the lord 
though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunish 

16 6 by merci and truth iniqu is purg and by the fear of the 
lord men depart from evil 

16 7 when a man s way plea the lord he maketh even hi enemi to 
be at peac with him 

16 8 better is a littl with righteou than great revenu without 
right 

16 9 a man s heart deviseth hi way but the lord directeth hi step 

16 10 a divin sentenc is in the lip of the king hi mouth 
transgresseth not in judgment 

16 11 a just weight and balanc are the lord s all the weight of the 
bag are hi work 

16 12 it is an abomin to king to commit wick for the 
throne is establish by righteou 

16 13 righteou lip are the delight of king and they love him that 
speaketh right 

16 14 the wrath of a king is a messeng of death but a wise man 
will pacifi it 

16 15 in the light of the king s counten is life and hi favour 
is a a cloud of the latter rain 

16 16 how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get 
understand rather to be chosen than silver 16 17 the highway of 
the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth hi way preserveth 
hi soul 

16 18 pride goeth befor destruct and an haughti spirit befor a 
fall 

16 19 better it is to be of an humbl spirit with the lowli than to 
divid the spoil with the proud 

16 20 he that handleth a matter wise shall find good and whoso 
trusteth in the lord happi is he 

16 21 the wise in heart shall be call prudent and the sweet of 
the lip increaseth learn 

16 22 understand is a wellspr of life unto him that hath it but 
the instruct of fool is folli 

16 23 the heart of the wise teacheth hi mouth and addeth learn to 
hi lip 

16 24 pleasant word are a an honeycomb sweet to the soul and 
health to the bone 

16 25 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end 
thereof are the way of death 

16 26 he that laboureth laboureth for himself for hi mouth craveth 
it of him 

16 27 an ungodli man diggeth up evil and in hi lip there is a a 
burn fire 

16 28 a froward man soweth strife and a whisper separateth chief 
friend 

16 29 a violent man enticeth hi neighbour and leadeth him into the 
way that is not good 

16 30 he shutteth hi eye to devi froward thing move hi lip 
he bringeth evil to pa 

16 31 the hoari head is a crown of glori if it be found in the way of 
righteou 

16 32 he that is slow to anger is better than the mighti and he that 
ruleth hi spirit than he that taketh a citi 

16 33 the lot is cast into the lap but the whole dispo thereof is 
of the lord 

17 1 better is a dri morsel and quiet therewith than an hou 
full of sacrif with strife 

17 2 a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and 
shall have part of the inherit among the brother 

17 3 the fine pot is for silver and the furnac for gold but the 
lord trieth the heart 

17 4 a wick doer giveth heed to fal lip and a liar giveth ear to 
a naughti tongu 

17 5 whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth hi maker and he that is glad 
at calam shall not be unpunish 

17 6 child s child are the crown of old men and the glori of 
child are their father 

17 7 excel speech becometh not a fool much le do lie lip a 
princ 

17 8 a gift is a a preciou stone in the eye of him that hath it 
whithersoev it turneth it prospereth 

17 9 he that covereth a transgress seeketh love but he that 
repeateth a matter separateth veri friend 

17 10 a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundr stripe 
into a fool 

17 11 an evil man seeketh onli rebellion therefor a cruel messeng 
shall be sent against him 

17 12 let a bear rob of her whelp meet a man rather than a fool 
in hi folli 

17 13 whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from hi 
hou 

17 14 the begin of strife is a when one letteth out water 
therefor leav off content befor it be meddl with 

17 15 he that justifieth the wick and he that condemneth the just 
even they both are abomin to the lord 

17 16 wherefor is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom 
see he hath no heart to it 17 17 a friend loveth at all time 
and a brother is born for adver 

17 18 a man void of understand striketh hand and becometh sureti 
in the presenc of hi friend 

17 19 he loveth transgress that loveth strife and he that exalteth 
hi gate seeketh destruct 

17 20 he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath a 
perver tongu falleth into mischief 

17 21 he that begetteth a fool doeth it to hi sorrow and the father 
of a fool hath no joy 

17 22 a merri heart doeth good like a medicin but a broken spirit 
drieth the bone 

17 23 a wick man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the way 
of judgment 

17 24 wisdom is befor him that hath understand but the eye of a 
fool are in the end of the earth 

17 25 a foolish son is a grief to hi father and bitter to her 
that bare him 

17 26 also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princ for 
equiti 

17 27 he that hath knowledg spareth hi word and a man of 
understand is of an excel spirit 

17 28 even a fool when he holdeth hi peac is count wise and he 
that shutteth hi lip is esteem a man of understand 

18 1 through desir a man have separ himself seeketh and 
intermeddleth with all wisdom 

18 2 a fool hath no delight in understand but that hi heart may 
discov itself 

18 3 when the wick cometh then cometh also contempt and with 
ignomini reproach 

18 4 the word of a man s mouth are a deep water and the wellspr 
of wisdom a a flow brook 

18 5 it is not good to accept the person of the wick to overthrow 
the righteou in judgment 

18 6 a fool s lip enter into content and hi mouth calleth for 
stroke 

18 7 a fool s mouth is hi destruct and hi lip are the snare of 
hi soul 

18 8 the word of a talebear are a wound and they go down into 
the innermost part of the belli 

18 9 he also that is sloth in hi work is brother to him that is a 
great waster 

18 10 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteou runneth 
into it and is safe 

18 11 the rich man s wealth is hi strong citi and a an high wall in 
hi own conceit 

18 12 befor destruct the heart of man is haughti and befor 
honour is humil 

18 13 he that answereth a matter befor he heareth it it is folli and 
shame unto him 

18 14 the spirit of a man will sustain hi infirm but a wound 
spirit who can bear 18 15 the heart of the prudent getteth 
knowledg and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledg 

18 16 a man s gift maketh room for him and bringeth him befor great 
men 

18 17 he that is first in hi own cau seemeth just but hi 
neighbour cometh and searcheth him 

18 18 the lot causeth content to cea and parteth between the 
mighti 

18 19 a brother offend is harder to be won than a strong citi and 
their content are like the bar of a castl 

18 20 a man s belli shall be satisfi with the fruit of hi mouth 
and with the increa of hi lip shall he be fill 

18 21 death and life are in the power of the tongu and they that 
love it shall eat the fruit thereof 

18 22 whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour 
of the lord 

18 23 the poor useth intreati but the rich answereth roughli 

18 24 a man that hath friend must shew himself friendli and there is 
a friend that sticketh closer than a brother 

19 1 better is the poor that walketh in hi integr than he that is 
perver in hi lip and is a fool 

19 2 also that the soul be without knowledg it is not good and he 
that hasteth with hi foot sinneth 

19 3 the foolish of man perverteth hi way and hi heart fretteth 
against the lord 

19 4 wealth maketh mani friend but the poor is separ from hi 
neighbour 

19 5 a fal wit shall not be unpunish and he that speaketh 
lie shall not escap 

19 6 mani will intreat the favour of the princ and everi man is a 
friend to him that giveth gift 

19 7 all the brother of the poor do hate him how much more do hi 
friend go far from him he pursueth them with word yet they are 
want to him 

19 8 he that getteth wisdom loveth hi own soul he that keepeth 
understand shall find good 

19 9 a fal wit shall not be unpunish and he that speaketh 
lie shall perish 

19 10 delight is not seemli for a fool much le for a servant to 
have rule over princ 

19 11 the discret of a man deferreth hi anger and it is hi glori 
to pa over a transgress 

19 12 the king s wrath is a the roar of a lion but hi favour is 
a dew upon the grass 

19 13 a foolish son is the calam of hi father and the content 
of a wife are a continu drop 

19 14 hou and rich are the inherit of father and a prudent 
wife is from the lord 

19 15 sloth casteth into a deep sleep and an idl soul shall 
suffer hunger 

19 16 he that keepeth the command keepeth hi own soul but he 
that despiseth hi way shall die 

19 17 he that hath piti upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and that 
which he hath given will he pay him again 

19 18 chasten thi son while there is hope and let not thi soul spare 
for hi cri 

19 19 a man of great wrath shall suffer punish for if thou 
deliv him yet thou must do it again 

19 20 hear counsel and receiv instruct that thou mayest be wise 
in thi latter end 

19 21 there are mani devic in a man s heart nevertheless the 
counsel of the lord that shall stand 

19 22 the desir of a man is hi kind and a poor man is better 
than a liar 

19 23 the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall 
abid satisfi he shall not be visit with evil 

19 24 a sloth man hideth hi hand in hi bosom and will not so 
much a bring it to hi mouth again 

19 25 smite a scorner and the simpl will bewar and reprov one 
that hath understand and he will understand knowledg 

19 26 he that wasteth hi father and chaseth away hi mother is a 
son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach 

19 27 cea my son to hear the instruct that causeth to err from 
the word of knowledg 

19 28 an ungodli wit scorneth judgment and the mouth of the 
wick devoureth iniqu 

19 29 judgment are prepar for scorner and stripe for the back of 
fool 

20 1 wine is a mocker strong drink is rage and whosoev is 
deceiv therebi is not wise 

20 2 the fear of a king is a the roar of a lion whoso provoketh 
him to anger sinneth against hi own soul 

20 3 it is an honour for a man to cea from strife but everi fool 
will be meddl 

20 4 the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefor shall 
he beg in harvest and have noth 

20 5 counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of 
understand will draw it out 

20 6 most men will proclaim everi one hi own good but a faith 
man who can find 20 7 the just man walketh in hi integr hi 
child are bless after him 

20 8 a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all 
evil with hi eye 

20 9 who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin 
20 10 diver weight and diver measur both of them are alik 
abomin to the lord 

20 11 even a child is known by hi do whether hi work be pure 
and whether it be right 

20 12 the hear ear and the see eye the lord hath made even 
both of them 

20 13 love not sleep lest thou come to poverti open thine eye and 
thou shalt be satisfi with bread 

20 14 it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gone 
hi way then he boasteth 

20 15 there is gold and a multitud of rubi but the lip of 
knowledg are a preciou jewel 

20 16 take hi garment that is sureti for a stranger and take a 
pledg of him for a strang woman 

20 17 bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterward hi mouth 
shall be fill with gravel 

20 18 everi purpo is establish by counsel and with good advic 
make war 

20 19 he that goeth about a a talebear revealeth secret therefor 
meddl not with him that flattereth with hi lip 

20 20 whoso curseth hi father or hi mother hi lamp shall be put 
out in obscur dark 

20 21 an inherit may be gotten hastili at the begin but the 
end thereof shall not be bless 

20 22 say not thou i will recompen evil but wait on the lord and 
he shall save thee 

20 23 diver weight are an abomin unto the lord and a fal 
balanc is not good 

20 24 man s go are of the lord how can a man then understand hi 
own way 20 25 it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is 
holi and after vow to make enquiri 

20 26 a wise king scattereth the wick and bringeth the wheel over 
them 

20 27 the spirit of man is the candl of the lord search all the 
inward part of the belli 

20 28 merci and truth preserv the king and hi throne is upholden by 
merci 

20 29 the glori of young men is their strength and the beauti of old 
men is the grey head 

20 30 the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripe the 
inward part of the belli 

21 1 the king s heart is in the hand of the lord a the river of 
water he turneth it whithersoev he will 

21 2 everi way of a man is right in hi own eye but the lord 
pondereth the heart 

21 3 to do justic and judgment is more accept to the lord than 
sacrif 

21 4 an high look and a proud heart and the plow of the wick 
is sin 

21 5 the thought of the dilig tend onli to plenteou but of 
everi one that is hasti onli to want 

21 6 the get of treasur by a lie tongu is a vaniti toss to 
and fro of them that seek death 

21 7 the robberi of the wick shall destroy them becau they refu 
to do judgment 

21 8 the way of man is froward and strang but a for the pure hi 
work is right 

21 9 it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a 
brawl woman in a wide hou 

21 10 the soul of the wick desireth evil hi neighbour findeth no 
favour in hi eye 

21 11 when the scorner is punish the simpl is made wise and when 
the wise is instruct he receiveth knowledg 

21 12 the righteou man wise considereth the hou of the wick 
but god overthroweth the wick for their wick 

21 13 whoso stoppeth hi ear at the cri of the poor he also shall 
cri himself but shall not be heard 

21 14 a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a reward in the bosom 
strong wrath 

21 15 it is joy to the just to do judgment but destruct shall be 
to the worker of iniqu 

21 16 the man that wandereth out of the way of understand shall 
remain in the congreg of the dead 

21 17 he that loveth pleasur shall be a poor man he that loveth wine 
and oil shall not be rich 

21 18 the wick shall be a ransom for the righteou and the 
transgressor for the upright 

21 19 it is better to dwell in the wilder than with a contenti 
and an angri woman 

21 20 there is treasur to be desir and oil in the dwell of the 
wise but a foolish man spendeth it up 

21 21 he that followeth after righteou and merci findeth life 
righteou and honour 

21 22 a wise man scaleth the citi of the mighti and casteth down the 
strength of the confid thereof 

21 23 whoso keepeth hi mouth and hi tongu keepeth hi soul from 
troubl 

21 24 proud and haughti scorner is hi name who dealeth in proud 
wrath 

21 25 the desir of the sloth killeth him for hi hand refu to 
labour 

21 26 he coveteth greedili all the day long but the righteou giveth 
and spareth not 

21 27 the sacrif of the wick is abomin how much more when 
he bringeth it with a wick mind 21 28 a fal wit shall 
perish but the man that heareth speaketh constantli 

21 29 a wick man hardeneth hi face but a for the upright he 
directeth hi way 

21 30 there is no wisdom nor understand nor counsel against the 
lord 

21 31 the hor is prepar against the day of battl but safeti is 
of the lord 

22 1 a good name is rather to be chosen than great rich and love 
favour rather than silver and gold 

22 2 the rich and poor meet togeth the lord is the maker of them 
all 

22 3 a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the 
simpl pa on and are punish 

22 4 by humil and the fear of the lord are rich and honour and 
life 

22 5 thorn and snare are in the way of the froward he that doth 
keep hi soul shall be far from them 

22 6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he 
will not depart from it 

22 7 the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrow is servant to the 
lender 

22 8 he that soweth iniqu shall reap vaniti and the rod of hi 
anger shall fail 

22 9 he that hath a bounti eye shall be bless for he giveth of 
hi bread to the poor 

22 10 cast out the scorner and content shall go out yea strife 
and reproach shall cea 

22 11 he that loveth pure of heart for the grace of hi lip the 
king shall be hi friend 

22 12 the eye of the lord preserv knowledg and he overthroweth the 
word of the transgressor 

22 13 the sloth man saith there is a lion without i shall be 
slain in the street 

22 14 the mouth of strang woman is a deep pit he that is abhor of 
the lord shall fall therein 

22 15 foolish is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of 
correct shall drive it far from him 

22 16 he that oppresseth the poor to increa hi rich and he that 
giveth to the rich shall sure come to want 

22 17 bow down thine ear and hear the word of the wise and appli 
thine heart unto my knowledg 

22 18 for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee they 
shall withal be fit in thi lip 

22 19 that thi trust may be in the lord i have made known to thee 
thi day even to thee 

22 20 have not i written to thee excel thing in counsel and 
knowledg 22 21 that i might make thee know the certainti of the 
word of truth that thou mightest answer the word of truth to them 
that send unto thee 22 22 rob not the poor becau he is poor 
neither oppress the afflict in the gate 22 23 for the lord will 
plead their cau and spoil the soul of those that spoil them 

22 24 make no friendship with an angri man and with a furiou man 
thou shalt not go 22 25 lest thou learn hi way and get a snare to 
thi soul 

22 26 be not thou one of them that strike hand or of them that are 
sureti for debt 

22 27 if thou hast noth to pay whi should he take away thi bed 
from under thee 22 28 remov not the ancient landmark which thi 
father have set 

22 29 seest thou a man dilig in hi busi he shall stand befor 
king he shall not stand befor mean men 

23 1 when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consid dilig what 
is befor thee 23 2 and put a knife to thi throat if thou be a man 
given to appetit 

23 3 be not desir of hi dainti for they are deceit meat 

23 4 labour not to be rich cea from thine own wisdom 

23 5 wilt thou set thine eye upon that which is not for rich 
certainli make themselv wing they fli away a an eagl toward 
heaven 

23 6 eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither 
desir thou hi dainti meat 23 7 for a he thinketh in hi heart so 
is he eat and drink saith he to thee but hi heart is not with 
thee 

23 8 the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose 
thi sweet word 

23 9 speak not in the ear of a fool for he will despi the wisdom 
of thi word 

23 10 remov not the old landmark and enter not into the field of 
the fatherless 23 11 for their redeem is mighti he shall plead 
their cau with thee 

23 12 appli thine heart unto instruct and thine ear to the word 
of knowledg 

23 13 withhold not correct from the child for if thou beatest him 
with the rod he shall not die 

23 14 thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliv hi soul 
from hell 

23 15 my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoic even 
mine 

23 16 yea my rein shall rejoic when thi lip speak right thing 

23 17 let not thine heart envi sinner but be thou in the fear of the 
lord all the day long 

23 18 for sure there is an end and thine expect shall not be 
cut off 

23 19 hear thou my son and be wise and guid thine heart in the 
way 

23 20 be not among winebibb among riotou eater of flesh 23 21 
for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverti and drowsi 
shall cloth a man with rag 

23 22 hearken unto thi father that begat thee and despi not thi 
mother when she is old 

23 23 buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruct 
and understand 

23 24 the father of the righteou shall greatli rejoic and he that 
begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him 

23 25 thi father and thi mother shall be glad and she that bare thee 
shall rejoic 

23 26 my son give me thine heart and let thine eye observ my way 

23 27 for a whore is a deep ditch and a strang woman is a narrow 
pit 

23 28 she also lieth in wait a for a prey and increaseth the 
transgressor among men 

23 29 who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath content who hath 
babbl who hath wound without cau who hath red of eye 
23 30 they that tarri long at the wine they that go to seek mix 
wine 

23 31 look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth hi 
colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright 

23 32 at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an 
adder 

23 33 thine eye shall behold strang woman and thine heart shall 
utter perver thing 

23 34 yea thou shalt be a he that lieth down in the midst of the 
sea or a he that lieth upon the top of a mast 

23 35 they have stricken me shalt thou say and i wa not sick they 
have beaten me and i felt it not when shall i awak i will seek it 
yet again 

24 1 be not thou enviou against evil men neither desir to be with 
them 

24 2 for their heart studieth destruct and their lip talk of 
mischief 

24 3 through wisdom is an hou build and by understand it is 
establish 24 4 and by knowledg shall the chamber be fill with 
all preciou and pleasant rich 

24 5 a wise man is strong yea a man of knowledg increaseth 
strength 

24 6 for by wise counsel thou shalt make thi war and in multitud of 
counsellor there is safeti 

24 7 wisdom is too high for a fool he openeth not hi mouth in the 
gate 

24 8 he that deviseth to do evil shall be call a mischiev person 

24 9 the thought of foolish is sin and the scorner is an 
abomin to men 

24 10 if thou faint in the day of adver thi strength is small 

24 11 if thou forbear to deliv them that are drawn unto death and 
those that are readi to be slain 24 12 if thou sayest behold we 
knew it not doth not he that pondereth the heart consid it and he 
that keepeth thi soul doth not he know it and shall not he render to 
everi man accord to hi work 24 13 my son eat thou honey 
becau it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thi tast 
24 14 so shall the knowledg of wisdom be unto thi soul when thou 
hast found it then there shall be a reward and thi expect shall 
not be cut off 

24 15 lay not wait o wick man against the dwell of the 
righteou spoil not hi rest place 24 16 for a just man falleth 
seven time and riseth up again but the wick shall fall into 
mischief 

24 17 rejoic not when thine enemi falleth and let not thine heart be 
glad when he stumbleth 24 18 lest the lord see it and it displea 
him and he turn away hi wrath from him 

24 19 fret not thyself becau of evil men neither be thou enviou at 
the wick 24 20 for there shall be no reward to the evil man the 
candl of the wick shall be put out 

24 21 my son fear thou the lord and the king and meddl not with 
them that are given to chang 24 22 for their calam shall rise 
suddenli and who knoweth the ruin of them both 24 23 these thing 
also belong to the wise it is not good to have respect of person in 
judgment 

24 24 he that saith unto the wick thou are righteou him shall the 
peopl cur nation shall abhor him 24 25 but to them that rebuk 
him shall be delight and a good bless shall come upon them 

24 26 everi man shall kiss hi lip that giveth a right answer 

24 27 prepar thi work without and make it fit for thyself in the 
field and afterward build thine hou 

24 28 be not a wit against thi neighbour without cau and 
deceiv not with thi lip 

24 29 say not i will do so to him a he hath done to me i will 
render to the man accord to hi work 

24 30 i went by the field of the sloth and by the vineyard of the 
man void of understand 24 31 and lo it wa all grown over with 
thorn and nettl had cover the face thereof and the stone wall 
thereof wa broken down 

24 32 then i saw and consid it well i look upon it and 
receiv instruct 

24 33 yet a littl sleep a littl slumber a littl fold of the 
hand to sleep 24 34 so shall thi poverti come a one that 
travelleth and thi want a an arm man 

25 1 these are also proverb of solomon which the men of hezekiah 
king of judah copi out 

25 2 it is the glori of god to conceal a thing but the honour of 
king is to search out a matter 

25 3 the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of 
king is unsearch 

25 4 take away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a 
vessel for the finer 

25 5 take away the wick from befor the king and hi throne shall 
be establish in righteou 

25 6 put not forth thyself in the presenc of the king and stand not 
in the place of great men 25 7 for better it is that it be said unto 
thee come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in the 
presenc of the princ whom thine eye have seen 

25 8 go not forth hastili to strive lest thou know not what to do in 
the end thereof when thi neighbour hath put thee to shame 

25 9 debat thi cau with thi neighbour himself and discov not a 
secret to anoth 25 10 lest he that heareth it put thee to shame 
and thine infami turn not away 

25 11 a word fitli spoken is like appl of gold in pictur of 
silver 

25 12 a an ear of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a 
wise reprov upon an obedi ear 

25 13 a the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faith 
messeng to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of hi 
master 

25 14 whoso boasteth himself of a fal gift is like cloud and wind 
without rain 

25 15 by long forbear is a princ persuad and a soft tongu 
breaketh the bone 

25 16 hast thou found honey eat so much a is suffici for thee 
lest thou be fill therewith and vomit it 

25 17 withdraw thi foot from thi neighbour s hou lest he be weari 
of thee and so hate thee 

25 18 a man that beareth fal wit against hi neighbour is a 
maul and a sword and a sharp arrow 

25 19 confid in an unfaith man in time of troubl is like a 
broken tooth and a foot out of joint 

25 20 a he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and a vinegar 
upon nitr so is he that singeth song to an heavi heart 

25 21 if thine enemi be hungri give him bread to eat and if he be 
thirsti give him water to drink 25 22 for thou shalt heap coal of 
fire upon hi head and the lord shall reward thee 

25 23 the north wind driveth away rain so doth an angri counten a 
backbit tongu 

25 24 it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a 
brawl woman and in a wide hou 

25 25 a cold water to a thirsti soul so is good news from a far 
countri 

25 26 a righteou man fall down befor the wick is a a troubl 
fountain and a corrupt spring 

25 27 it is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their own 
glori is not glori 

25 28 he that hath no rule over hi own spirit is like a citi that is 
broken down and without wall 

26 1 a snow in summer and a rain in harvest so honour is not 
seemli for a fool 

26 2 a the bird by wander a the swallow by fli so the cur 
causeless shall not come 

26 3 a whip for the hor a bridl for the a and a rod for the 
fool s back 

26 4 answer not a fool accord to hi folli lest thou also be like 
unto him 

26 5 answer a fool accord to hi folli lest he be wise in hi own 
conceit 

26 6 he that sendeth a messag by the hand of a fool cutteth off the 
foot and drinketh damag 

26 7 the leg of the lame are not equal so is a parabl in the mouth 
of fool 

26 8 a he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth 
honour to a fool 

26 9 a a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parabl 
in the mouth of fool 

26 10 the great god that form all thing both rewardeth the fool 
and rewardeth transgressor 

26 11 a a dog returneth to hi vomit so a fool returneth to hi 
folli 

26 12 seest thou a man wise in hi own conceit there is more hope of 
a fool than of him 

26 13 the sloth man saith there is a lion in the way a lion is in 
the street 

26 14 a the door turneth upon hi hing so doth the sloth upon 
hi bed 

26 15 the sloth hideth hi hand in hi bosom it grieveth him to 
bring it again to hi mouth 

26 16 the sluggard is wiser in hi own conceit than seven men that can 
render a reason 

26 17 he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belong not to 
him is like one that taketh a dog by the ear 

26 18 a a mad man who casteth firebrand arrow and death 26 19 so 
is the man that deceiveth hi neighbour and saith am not i in sport 
26 20 where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no 
talebear the strife ceaseth 

26 21 a coal are to burn coal and wood to fire so is a 
contenti man to kindl strife 

26 22 the word of a talebear are a wound and they go down into 
the innermost part of the belli 

26 23 burn lip and a wick heart are like a potsherd cover with 
silver dross 

26 24 he that hateth dissembleth with hi lip and layeth up deceit 
within him 26 25 when he speaketh fair believ him not for there 
are seven abomin in hi heart 

26 26 whose hatr is cover by deceit hi wick shall be 
shew befor the whole congreg 

26 27 whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a 
stone it will return upon him 

26 28 a lie tongu hateth those that are afflict by it and a 
flatter mouth worketh ruin 

27 1 boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a day 
may bring forth 

27 2 let anoth man prai thee and not thine own mouth a stranger 
and not thine own lip 

27 3 a stone is heavi and the sand weighti but a fool s wrath is 
heavier than them both 

27 4 wrath is cruel and anger is outrag but who is abl to stand 
befor envi 27 5 open rebuk is better than secret love 

27 6 faith are the wound of a friend but the kiss of an enemi 
are deceit 

27 7 the full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungri soul everi 
bitter thing is sweet 

27 8 a a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that 
wandereth from hi place 

27 9 ointment and perfum rejoic the heart so doth the sweet of 
a man s friend by hearti counsel 

27 10 thine own friend and thi father s friend forsak not neither 
go into thi brother s hou in the day of thi calam for better is 
a neighbour that is near than a brother far off 

27 11 my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer him 
that reproacheth me 

27 12 a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the 
simpl pa on and are punish 

27 13 take hi garment that is sureti for a stranger and take a 
pledg of him for a strang woman 

27 14 he that blesseth hi friend with a loud voic rise earli in 
the morn it shall be count a cur to him 

27 15 a continu drop in a veri raini day and a contenti woman 
are alik 

27 16 whosoev hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of hi 
right hand which bewrayeth itself 

27 17 iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the counten of hi 
friend 

27 18 whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so he 
that waiteth on hi master shall be honour 

27 19 a in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man 

27 20 hell and destruct are never full so the eye of man are 
never satisfi 

27 21 a the fine pot for silver and the furnac for gold so is a 
man to hi prai 

27 22 though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a 
pestl yet will not hi foolish depart from him 

27 23 be thou dilig to know the state of thi flock and look well 
to thi herd 

27 24 for rich are not for ever and doth the crown endur to everi 
gener 27 25 the hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth 
itself and herb of the mountain are gather 

27 26 the lamb are for thi cloth and the goat are the price of 
the field 

27 27 and thou shalt have goat milk enough for thi food for the 
food of thi household and for the mainten for thi maiden 

28 1 the wick flee when no man pursueth but the righteou are bold 
a a lion 

28 2 for the transgress of a land mani are the princ thereof but 
by a man of understand and knowledg the state thereof shall be 
prolong 

28 3 a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweep rain which 
leaveth no food 

28 4 they that forsak the law prai the wick but such a keep the 
law contend with them 

28 5 evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord 
understand all thing 

28 6 better is the poor that walketh in hi upright than he that 
is perver in hi way though he be rich 

28 7 whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion 
of riotou men shameth hi father 

28 8 he that by usuri and unjust gain increaseth hi substanc he 
shall gather it for him that will piti the poor 

28 9 he that turneth away hi ear from hear the law even hi 
prayer shall be abomin 

28 10 whoso causeth the righteou to go astray in an evil way he 
shall fall himself into hi own pit but the upright shall have good 
thing in poss 

28 11 the rich man is wise in hi own conceit but the poor that hath 
understand searcheth him out 

28 12 when righteou men do rejoic there is great glori but when 
the wick rise a man is hidden 

28 13 he that covereth hi sin shall not prosper but whoso 
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have merci 

28 14 happi is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth hi 
heart shall fall into mischief 

28 15 a a roar lion and a rang bear so is a wick ruler over 
the poor peopl 

28 16 the princ that wanteth understand is also a great oppressor 
but he that hateth covet shall prolong hi day 

28 17 a man that doeth violenc to the blood of ani person shall flee 
to the pit let no man stay him 

28 18 whoso walketh uprightli shall be save but he that is perver 
in hi way shall fall at onc 

28 19 he that tilleth hi land shall have plenti of bread but he that 
followeth after vain person shall have poverti enough 

28 20 a faith man shall abound with bless but he that maketh 
hast to be rich shall not be innoc 

28 21 to have respect of person is not good for for a piec of bread 
that man will transgress 

28 22 he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not 
that poverti shall come upon him 

28 23 he that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favour than he 
that flattereth with the tongu 

28 24 whoso robbeth hi father or hi mother and saith it is no 
transgress the same is the companion of a destroy 

28 25 he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that 
putteth hi trust in the lord shall be made fat 

28 26 he that trusteth in hi own heart is a fool but whoso walketh 
wise he shall be deliv 

28 27 he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth 
hi eye shall have mani a cur 

28 28 when the wick rise men hide themselv but when they perish 
the righteou increa 

29 1 he that be often reprov hardeneth hi neck shall suddenli 
be destroy and that without remedi 

29 2 when the righteou are in author the peopl rejoic but when 
the wick beareth rule the peopl mourn 

29 3 whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth hi father but he that keepeth 
compani with harlot spendeth hi substanc 

29 4 the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth 
gift overthroweth it 

29 5 a man that flattereth hi neighbour spreadeth a net for hi foot 

29 6 in the transgress of an evil man there is a snare but the 
righteou doth sing and rejoic 

29 7 the righteou considereth the cau of the poor but the wick 
regardeth not to know it 

29 8 scorn men bring a citi into a snare but wise men turn away 
wrath 

29 9 if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or 
laugh there is no rest 

29 10 the bloodthirsti hate the upright but the just seek hi soul 

29 11 a fool uttereth all hi mind but a wise man keepeth it in till 
afterward 

29 12 if a ruler hearken to lie all hi servant are wick 

29 13 the poor and the deceit man meet togeth the lord 
lighteneth both their eye 

29 14 the king that faith judgeth the poor hi throne shall be 
establish for ever 

29 15 the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself 
bringeth hi mother to shame 

29 16 when the wick are multipli transgress increaseth but 
the righteou shall see their fall 

29 17 correct thi son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give 
delight unto thi soul 

29 18 where there is no vision the peopl perish but he that keepeth 
the law happi is he 

29 19 a servant will not be correct by word for though he 
understand he will not answer 

29 20 seest thou a man that is hasti in hi word there is more hope 
of a fool than of him 

29 21 he that delic bringeth up hi servant from a child shall 
have him becom hi son at the length 

29 22 an angri man stirreth up strife and a furiou man aboundeth in 
transgress 

29 23 a man s pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the 
humbl in spirit 

29 24 whoso is partner with a thief hateth hi own soul he heareth 
cur and bewrayeth it not 

29 25 the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth hi trust in 
the lord shall be safe 

29 26 mani seek the ruler s favour but everi man s judgment cometh 
from the lord 

29 27 an unjust man is an abomin to the just and he that is 
upright in the way is abomin to the wick 

30 1 the word of agur the son of jakeh even the propheci the man 
spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal 30 2 sure i am more 
brutish than ani man and have not the understand of a man 

30 3 i neither learn wisdom nor have the knowledg of the holi 

30 4 who hath ascend up into heaven or descend who hath gather 
the wind in hi fist who hath bound the water in a garment who 
hath establish all the end of the earth what is hi name and what 
is hi son s name if thou canst tell 30 5 everi word of god is 
pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him 

30 6 add thou not unto hi word lest he reprov thee and thou be 
found a liar 

30 7 two thing have i requir of thee deni me them not befor i 
die 30 8 remov far from me vaniti and lie give me neither poverti 
nor rich feed me with food conveni for me 30 9 lest i be full 
and deni thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal 
and take the name of my god in vain 

30 10 accu not a servant unto hi master lest he cur thee and 
thou be found guilti 

30 11 there is a gener that curseth their father and doth not 
bless their mother 

30 12 there is a gener that are pure in their own eye and yet 
is not wash from their filthi 

30 13 there is a gener o how lofti are their eye and their 
eyelid are lift up 

30 14 there is a gener whose teeth are a sword and their jaw 
teeth a knife to devour the poor from off the earth and the needi 
from among men 

30 15 the horseleach hath two daughter cri give give there are 
three thing that are never satisfi yea four thing say not it is 
enough 30 16 the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not 
fill with water and the fire that saith not it is enough 

30 17 the eye that mocketh at hi father and despiseth to obey hi 
mother the raven of the valley shall pick it out and the young 
eagl shall eat it 

30 18 there be three thing which are too wonder for me yea four 
which i know not 30 19 the way of an eagl in the air the way of a 
serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and 
the way of a man with a maid 

30 20 such is the way of an adult woman she eateth and wipeth 
her mouth and saith i have done no wick 

30 21 for three thing the earth is disquiet and for four which it 
cannot bear 30 22 for a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he 
is fill with meat 30 23 for an odiou woman when she is marri 
and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress 

30 24 there be four thing which are littl upon the earth but they 
are exceed wise 30 25 the ant are a peopl not strong yet they 
prepar their meat in the summer 30 26 the coni are but a feebl 
folk yet make they their hou in the rock 30 27 the locust have 
no king yet go they forth all of them by band 30 28 the spider 
taketh hold with her hand and is in king palac 

30 29 there be three thing which go well yea four are come in 
go 30 30 a lion which is strongest among beast and turneth not 
away for ani 30 31 a greyhound an he goat also and a king against 
whom there is no rise up 

30 32 if thou hast done foolishli in lift up thyself or if thou 
hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thi mouth 

30 33 sure the churn of milk bringeth forth butter and the 
wring of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forc of wrath 
bringeth forth strife 

31 1 the word of king lemuel the propheci that hi mother taught 
him 

31 2 what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of 
my vow 31 3 give not thi strength unto woman nor thi way to that 
which destroyeth king 

31 4 it is not for king o lemuel it is not for king to drink wine 
nor for princ strong drink 31 5 lest they drink and forget the 
law and pervert the judgment of ani of the afflict 

31 6 give strong drink unto him that is readi to perish and wine unto 
those that be of heavi heart 

31 7 let him drink and forget hi poverti and rememb hi miseri no 
more 

31 8 open thi mouth for the dumb in the cau of all such a are 
appoint to destruct 

31 9 open thi mouth judg righteou and plead the cau of the 
poor and needi 

31 10 who can find a virtuou woman for her price is far abov 
rubi 

31 11 the heart of her husband doth safe trust in her so that he 
shall have no need of spoil 

31 12 she will do him good and not evil all the day of her life 

31 13 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingli with her 
hand 

31 14 she is like the merchant ship she bringeth her food from 
afar 

31 15 she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her 
household and a portion to her maiden 

31 16 she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her 
hand she planteth a vineyard 

31 17 she girdeth her loin with strength and strengtheneth her arm 

31 18 she perceiveth that her merchandi is good her candl goeth 
not out by night 

31 19 she layeth her hand to the spindl and her hand hold the 
distaff 

31 20 she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth 
her hand to the needi 

31 21 she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her 
household are cloth with scarlet 

31 22 she maketh herself cover of tapestri her cloth is silk 
and purpl 

31 23 her husband is known in the gate when he sitteth among the 
elder of the land 

31 24 she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdl 
unto the merchant 

31 25 strength and honour are her cloth and she shall rejoic in 
time to come 

31 26 she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongu is the law 
of kind 

31 27 she looketh well to the way of her household and eateth not 
the bread of idl 

31 28 her child ari up and call her bless her husband also 
and he praiseth her 

31 29 mani daughter have done virtuou but thou excellest them 
all 

31 30 favour is deceit and beauti is vain but a woman that 
feareth the lord she shall be prai 

31 31 give her of the fruit of her hand and let her own work prai 
her in the gate

the preacher 


1 1 the word of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem 

1 2 vaniti of vaniti saith the preacher vaniti of vaniti all is 
vaniti 

1 3 what profit hath a man of all hi labour which he taketh under the 
sun 1 4 one gener passeth away and anoth gener cometh 
but the earth abideth for ever 

1 5 the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to hi 
place where he aro 

1 6 the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north 
it whirleth about continu and the wind returneth again accord 
to hi circuit 

1 7 all the river run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the 
place from whenc the river come thither they return again 

1 8 all thing are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not 
satisfi with see nor the ear fill with hear 

1 9 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that 
which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing 
under the sun 

1 10 is there ani thing whereof it may be said see thi is new it 
hath been alreadi of old time which wa befor u

ani remembr of thing that are to come with those that shall come 
after 

1 12 i the preacher wa king over israel in jerusalem 

1 13 and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concern 
all thing that are done under heaven thi sore travail hath god 
given to the son of man to be exerci therewith 

1 14 i have seen all the work that are done under the sun and

estat and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been 
befor me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experi of wisdom 
and knowledg 

1 17 and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know mad and 
folli i perceiv that thi also is vexat of spirit 

1 18 for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth 
knowledg increaseth sorrow 

2 1 i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth 
therefor enjoy pleasur and behold thi also is vaniti 

2 2 i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it 2 3 i 
sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquaint mine 
heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folli till i might see what wa 
that good for the son of men which they should do under the heaven 
all the day of their life 

2 4 i made me great work i build me hou i plant me 
vineyard 2 5 i made me garden and orchard and i plant tree in 
them of all kind of fruit 2 6 i made me pool of water to water 
therewith the wood that bringeth forth tree 2 7 i got me servant 
and maiden and had servant born in my hou also i had great 
poss of great and small cattl abov all that were in jerusalem 
befor me 2 8 i gather me also silver and gold and the peculiar 
treasur of king and of the provinc i gat me men singer and woman 
singer and the delight of the son of men a music instrument 
and that of all sort 

2 9 so i wa great and increa more than all that were befor me in 
jerusalem also my wisdom remain with me 

2 10 and whatsoev mine eye desir i kept not from them i withheld 
not my heart from ani joy for my heart rejoic in all my labour and 
thi wa my portion of all my labour 

2 11 then i look on all the work that my hand had wrought and on 
the labour that i had labour to do and behold all wa vaniti and 
vexat of spirit and there wa no profit under the sun 

2 12 and i turn myself to behold wisdom and mad and folli for 
what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath 
been alreadi done 

2 13 then i saw that wisdom excelleth folli a far a light excelleth 
dark 

2 14 the wise man s eye are in hi head but the fool walketh in 
dark and i myself perceiv also that one event happeneth to them 
all 

2 15 then said i in my heart a it happeneth to the fool so it 
happeneth even to me and whi wa i then more wise then i said in my 
heart that thi also is vaniti 

2 16 for there is no remembr of the wise more than of the fool for 
ever see that which now is in the day to come shall all be 
forgotten 

and how dieth the wise man a the fool 

2 17 therefor i hate life becau the work that is wrought under 
the sun is grievou unto me for all is vaniti and vexat of spirit 

2 18 yea i hate all my labour which i had taken under the sun 
becau i should leav it unto the man that shall be after me 

2 19 and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet 
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have labour and 
wherein i have shew myself wise under the sun thi is also vaniti 

2 20 therefor i went about to cau my heart to despair of all the 
labour which i took under the sun 

2 21 for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledg 
and in equiti yet to a man that hath not labour therein shall he 
leav it for hi portion thi also is vaniti and a great evil 

2 22 for what hath man of all hi labour and of the vexat of hi 
heart wherein he hath labour under the sun 2 23 for all hi day 
are sorrow and hi travail grief yea hi heart taketh not rest in 
the night thi is also vaniti 

2 24 there is noth better for a man than that he should eat and 
drink and that he should make hi soul enjoy good in hi labour thi 
also i saw that it wa from the hand of god 

2 25 for who can eat or who el can hasten hereunto more than i 
2 26 for god giveth to a man that is good in hi sight wisdom and 
knowledg and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and 
to heap up that he may give to him that is good befor god thi also 
is vaniti and vexat of spirit 

3 1 to everi thing there is a season and a time to everi purpo 
under the heaven 3 2 a time to be born and a time to die a time to 
plant and a time to pluck up that which is plant 3 3 a time to 
kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build 
up 3 4 a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a 
time to danc 3 5 a time to cast away stone and a time to gather 
stone togeth a time to embrac and a time to refrain from 
embrac 3 6 a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and 
a time to cast away 3 7 a time to rend and a time to sew a time to 
keep silenc and a time to speak 3 8 a time to love and a time to 
hate a time of war and a time of peac 

3 9 what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth 
3 10 i have seen the travail which god hath given to the son of men 
to be exerci in it 

3 11 he hath made everi thing beauti in hi time also he hath set 
the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that 
god maketh from the begin to the end 

3 12 i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoic 
and to do good in hi life 

3 13 and also that everi man should eat and drink and enjoy the good 
of all hi labour it is the gift of god 

3 14 i know that whatsoev god doeth it shall be for ever noth 
can be put to it nor ani thing taken from it and god doeth it that 
men should fear befor him 

3 15 that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath alreadi 
been and god requireth that which is past 

3 16 and moreov i saw under the sun the place of judgment that 
wick wa there and the place of righteou that iniqu 
wa there 

3 17 i said in mine heart god shall judg the righteou and the 
wick for there is a time there for everi purpo and for everi 
work 

3 18 i said in mine heart concern the estat of the son of men 
that god might manifest them and that they might see that they 
themselv are beast 

3 19 for that which befalleth the son of men befalleth beast even 
one thing befalleth them a the one dieth so dieth the other yea 
they have all one breath so that a man hath no preemin abov a 
beast for all is vaniti 

3 20 all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust 
again 

3 21 who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit 
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth 3 22 wherefor i 
perceiv that there is noth better than that a man should rejoic 
in hi own work for that is hi portion for who shall bring him to 
see what shall be after him 4 1 so i return and consid all 
the oppress that are done under the sun and behold the tear of 
such a were oppress and they had no comfort and on the side of 
their oppressor there wa power but they had no comfort 

4 2 wherefor i prai the dead which are alreadi dead more than the 
live which are yet aliv 

4 3 yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who 
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun 

4 4 again i consid all travail and everi right work that for 
thi a man is envi of hi neighbour thi is also vaniti and 
vexat of spirit 

4 5 the fool foldeth hi hand togeth and eateth hi own flesh 

4 6 better is an hand with quiet than both the hand full with 
travail and vexat of spirit 

4 7 then i return and i saw vaniti under the sun 

4 8 there is one alon and there is not a second yea he hath 
neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all hi labour 
neither is hi eye satisfi with rich neither saith he for whom 
do i labour and bereav my soul of good thi is also vaniti yea it 
is a sore travail 

4 9 two are better than one becau they have a good reward for their 
labour 

4 10 for if they fall the one will lift up hi fellow but woe to him 
that is alon when he falleth for he hath not anoth to help him up 

4 11 again if two lie togeth then they have heat but how can one 
be warm alon 4 12 and if one prevail against him two shall 
withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickli broken 

4 13 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king 
who will no more be admonish 

4 14 for out of prison he cometh to reign wherea also he that is 
born in hi kingdom becometh poor 

4 15 i consid all the live which walk under the sun with the 
second child that shall stand up in hi stead 

4 16 there is no end of all the peopl even of all that have been 
befor them they also that come after shall not rejoic in him 
sure thi also is vaniti and vexat of spirit 

5 1 keep thi foot when thou goest to the hou of god and be more 
readi to hear than to give the sacrif of fool for they consid 
not that they do evil 

5 2 be not rash with thi mouth and let not thine heart be hasti to 
utter ani thing befor god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth 
therefor let thi word be few 

5 3 for a dream cometh through the multitud of busi and a fool s 
voic is known by multitud of word 

5 4 when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath 
no pleasur in fool pay that which thou hast vow 

5 5 better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest 
vow and not pay 

5 6 suffer not thi mouth to cau thi flesh to sin neither say thou 
befor the angel that it wa an error wherefor should god be angri 
at thi voic and destroy the work of thine hand 5 7 for in the 
multitud of dream and mani word there are also diver vaniti but 
fear thou god 

5 8 if thou seest the oppress of the poor and violent pervert 
of judgment and justic in a provinc marvel not at the matter for 
he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than 
they 

5 9 moreov the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is 
serv by the field 

5 10 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfi with silver nor he 
that loveth abund with increa thi is also vaniti 

5 11 when good increa they are increa that eat them and what 
good is there to the owner thereof save the behold of them with 
their eye 5 12 the sleep of a labour man is sweet whether he 
eat littl or much but the abund of the rich will not suffer him 
to sleep 

5 13 there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun name 
rich kept for the owner thereof to their hurt 

5 14 but those rich perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son 
and there is noth in hi hand 

5 15 a he came forth of hi mother s womb nake shall he return to 
go a he came and shall take noth of hi labour which he may 
carri away in hi hand 

5 16 and thi also is a sore evil that in all point a he came so 
shall he go and what profit hath he that hath labour for the wind 
5 17 all hi day also he eateth in dark and he hath much sorrow 
and wrath with hi sick 

5 18 behold that which i have seen it is good and come for one to 
eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all hi labour that he 
taketh under the sun all the day of hi life which god giveth him 
for it is hi portion 

5 19 everi man also to whom god hath given rich and wealth and hath 
given him power to eat thereof and to take hi portion and to 
rejoic in hi labour thi is the gift of god 

5 20 for he shall not much rememb the day of hi life becau god 
answereth him in the joy of hi heart 

6 1 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common 
among men 6 2 a man to whom god hath given rich wealth and 
honour so that he wanteth noth for hi soul of all that he 
desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger 
eateth it thi is vaniti and it is an evil disea 

6 3 if a man beget an hundr child and live mani year so that 
the day of hi year be mani and hi soul be not fill with good 
and also that he have no burial i say that an untim birth is 
better than he 

6 4 for he cometh in with vaniti and departeth in dark and hi 
name shall be cover with dark 

6 5 moreov he hath not seen the sun nor known ani thing thi hath 
more rest than the other 

6 6 yea though he live a thousand year twice told yet hath he seen 
no good do not all go to one place 6 7 all the labour of man is for 
hi mouth and yet the appetit is not fill 

6 8 for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor 
that knoweth to walk befor the live 6 9 better is the sight of 
the eye than the wander of the desir thi is also vaniti and 
vexat of spirit 

6 10 that which hath been is name alreadi and it is known that it is 
man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he 

6 11 see there be mani thing that increa vaniti what is man the 
better 6 12 for who knoweth what is good for man in thi life all 
the day of hi vain life which he spendeth a a shadow for who can 
tell a man what shall be after him under the sun 7 1 a good name is 
better than preciou ointment and the day of death than the day of 
one s birth 

7 2 it is better to go to the hou of mourn than to go to the 
hou of feast for that is the end of all men and the live will 
lay it to hi heart 

7 3 sorrow is better than laughter for by the sad of the 
counten the heart is made better 

7 4 the heart of the wise is in the hou of mourn but the heart 
of fool is in the hou of mirth 

7 5 it is better to hear the rebuk of the wise than for a man to 
hear the song of fool 

7 6 for a the crackl of thorn under a pot so is the laughter of 
the fool thi also is vaniti 

7 7 sure oppress maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the 
heart 

7 8 better is the end of a thing than the begin thereof and the 
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit 

7 9 be not hasti in thi spirit to be angri for anger resteth in the 
bosom of fool 

7 10 say not thou what is the cau that the former day were better 
than these for thou dost not enquir wise concern thi 

7 11 wisdom is good with an inherit and by it there is profit to 
them that see the sun 

7 12 for wisdom is a defenc and money is a defenc but the 
excel of knowledg is that wisdom giveth life to them that have 
it 

7 13 consid the work of god for who can make that straight which 
he hath made crook 7 14 in the day of prosper be joy but in 
the day of adver consid god also hath set the one over against 
the other to the end that man should find noth after him 

7 15 all thing have i seen in the day of my vaniti there is a just 
man that perisheth in hi righteou and there is a wick man 
that prolongeth hi life in hi wick 

7 16 be not righteou over much neither make thyself over wise whi 
shouldest thou destroy thyself 7 17 be not over much wick 
neither be thou foolish whi shouldest thou die befor thi time 7 18 
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of thi yea also from thi 
withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of 
them all 

7 19 wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighti men which are 
in the citi 

7 20 for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and 
sinneth not 

7 21 also take no heed unto all word that are spoken lest thou hear 
thi servant cur thee 7 22 for oftentim also thine own heart 
knoweth that thou thyself likewi hast cur other 

7 23 all thi have i prove by wisdom i said i will be wise but it 
wa far from me 

7 24 that which is far off and exceed deep who can find it out 
7 25 i appli mine heart to know and to search and to seek out 
wisdom and the reason of thing and to know the wick of folli 
even of foolish and mad 7 26 and i find more bitter than 
death the woman whose heart is snare and net and her hand a 
band whoso pleaseth god shall escap from her but the sinner shall 
be taken by her 

7 27 behold thi have i found saith the preacher count one by 
one to find out the account 7 28 which yet my soul seeketh but i 
find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all 
those have i not found 

7 29 lo thi onli have i found that god hath made man upright but 
they have sought out mani invent 

8 1 who is a the wise man and who knoweth the interpret of a 
thing a man s wisdom maketh hi face to shine and the bold of 
hi face shall be chang 

8 2 i counsel thee to keep the king s command and that in regard 
of the oath of god 

8 3 be not hasti to go out of hi sight stand not in an evil thing 
for he doeth whatsoev pleaseth him 

8 4 where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto 
him what doest thou 8 5 whoso keepeth the command shall feel no 
evil thing and a wise man s heart discerneth both time and judgment 

8 6 becau to everi purpo there is time and judgment therefor the 
miseri of man is great upon him 

8 7 for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when 
it shall be 8 8 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to 
retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and 
there is no discharg in that war neither shall wick deliv 
those that are given to it 

8 9 all thi have i seen and appli my heart unto everi work that is 
done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over 
anoth to hi own hurt 

8 10 and so i saw the wick buri who had come and gone from the 
place of the holi and they were forgotten in the citi where they had 
so done thi is also vaniti 

8 11 becau sentenc against an evil work is not execut speedili 
therefor the heart of the son of men is fulli set in them to do 
evil 

8 12 though a sinner do evil an hundr time and hi day be 
prolong yet sure i know that it shall be well with them that fear 
god which fear befor him 8 13 but it shall not be well with the 
wick neither shall he prolong hi day which are a a shadow 
becau he feareth not befor god 

8 14 there is a vaniti which is done upon the earth that there be 
just men unto whom it happeneth accord to the work of the wick 
again there be wick men to whom it happeneth accord to the work 
of the righteou i said that thi also is vaniti 

8 15 then i commend mirth becau a man hath no better thing under 
the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merri for that shall 
abid with him of hi labour the day of hi life which god giveth 
him under the sun 

8 16 when i appli mine heart to know wisdom and to see the busi 
that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor 
night seeth sleep with hi eye 8 17 then i beheld all the work of 
god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun 
becau though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it 
yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be 
abl to find it 

9 1 for all thi i consid in my heart even to declar all thi 
that the righteou and the wise and their work are in the hand of 
god no man knoweth either love or hatr by all that is befor them 

9 2 all thing come alik to all there is one event to the righteou 
and to the wick to the good and to the clean and to the unclean 
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not a is the 
good so is the sinner and he that sweareth a he that feareth an 
oath 

9 3 thi is an evil among all thing that are done under the sun that 
there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the son of men is 
full of evil and mad is in their heart while they live and after 
that they go to the dead 

9 4 for to him that is join to all the live there is hope for a 
live dog is better than a dead lion 

9 5 for the live know that they shall die but the dead know not ani 
thing neither have they ani more a reward for the memori of them is 
forgotten 

9 6 also their love and their hatr and their envi is now 
perish neither have they ani more a portion for ever in ani thing 
that is done under the sun 

9 7 go thi way eat thi bread with joy and drink thi wine with a 
merri heart for god now accepteth thi work 

9 8 let thi garment be alway white and let thi head lack no 
ointment 

9 9 live joy with the wife whom thou lovest all the day of the 
life of thi vaniti which he hath given thee under the sun all the 
day of thi vaniti for that is thi portion in thi life and in thi 
labour which thou takest under the sun 

9 10 whatsoev thi hand findeth to do do it with thi might for 
there is no work nor devic nor knowledg nor wisdom in the grave 
whither thou goest 

9 11 i return and saw under the sun that the race is not to the 
swift nor the battl to the strong neither yet bread to the wise 
nor yet rich to men of understand nor yet favour to men of 
skill but time and chanc happeneth to them all 

9 12 for man also knoweth not hi time a the fish that are taken 
in an evil net and a the bird that are caught in the snare so are 
the son of men snare in an evil time when it falleth suddenli upon 
them 

9 13 thi wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seem great 
unto me 9 14 there wa a littl citi and few men within it and 
there came a great king against it and besieg it and built great 
bulwark against it 9 15 now there wa found in it a poor wise man 
and he by hi wisdom deliv the citi yet no man rememb that 
same poor man 

9 16 then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the 
poor man s wisdom is despi and hi word are not heard 

9 17 the word of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cri of him 
that ruleth among fool 

9 18 wisdom is better than weapon of war but one sinner destroyeth 
much good 

10 1 dead fli cau the ointment of the apothecari to send forth a 
stink savour so doth a littl folli him that is in reput for 
wisdom and honour 

10 2 a wise man s heart is at hi right hand but a fool s heart at 
hi left 

10 3 yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way hi wisdom 
faileth him and he saith to everi one that he is a fool 

10 4 if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leav not thi 
place for yield pacifieth great offenc 

10 5 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun a an error 
which proceedeth from the ruler 10 6 folli is set in great digniti 
and the rich sit in low place 

10 7 i have seen servant upon hor and princ walk a servant 
upon the earth 

10 8 he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an 
hedg a serpent shall bite him 

10 9 whoso removeth stone shall be hurt therewith and he that 
cleaveth wood shall be endang therebi 

10 10 if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edg then must he 
put to more strength but wisdom is profit to direct 

10 11 sure the serpent will bite without enchant and a babbler 
is no better 

10 12 the word of a wise man s mouth are graciou but the lip of a 
fool will swallow up himself 

10 13 the begin of the word of hi mouth is foolish and the 
end of hi talk is mischiev mad 

10 14 a fool also is full of word a man cannot tell what shall be 
and what shall be after him who can tell him 10 15 the labour of 
the foolish wearieth everi one of them becau he knoweth not how to 
go to the citi 

10 16 woe to thee o land when thi king is a child and thi princ 
eat in the morn 10 17 bless art thou o land when thi king is 
the son of nobl and thi princ eat in due season for strength 
and not for drunken 10 18 by much sloth the build 
decayeth and through idl of the hand the hou droppeth 
through 

10 19 a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merri but money 
answereth all thing 

10 20 cur not the king no not in thi thought and cur not the 
rich in thi bedchamb for a bird of the air shall carri the voic 
and that which hath wing shall tell the matter 

11 1 cast thi bread upon the water for thou shalt find it after mani 
day 

11 2 give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not 
what evil shall be upon the earth 

11 3 if the cloud be full of rain they empti themselv upon the 
earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in 
the place where the tree falleth there it shall be 

11 4 he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth 
the cloud shall not reap 

11 5 a thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the 
bone do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou 
knowest not the work of god who maketh all 

11 6 in the morn sow thi seed and in the even withhold not 
thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either thi or 
that or whether they both shall be alik good 

11 7 truli the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eye 
to behold the sun 11 8 but if a man live mani year and rejoic in 
them all yet let him rememb the day of dark for they shall be 
mani all that cometh is vaniti 

11 9 rejoic o young man in thi youth and let thi heart cheer thee 
in the day of thi youth and walk in the way of thine heart and in 
the sight of thine eye but know thou that for all these thing god 
will bring thee into judgment 

11 10 therefor remov sorrow from thi heart and put away evil from 
thi flesh for childhood and youth are vaniti 

12 1 rememb now thi creator in the day of thi youth while the evil 
day come not nor the year draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no 
pleasur in them 12 2 while the sun or the light or the moon or 
the star be not darken nor the cloud return after the rain 12 3 
in the day when the keeper of the hou shall trembl and the strong 
men shall bow themselv and the grinder cea becau they are few 
and those that look out of the window be darken 12 4 and the door 
shall be shut in the street when the sound of the grind is low 
and he shall rise up at the voic of the bird and all the daughter 
of musick shall be brought low 12 5 also when they shall be afraid of 
that which is high and fear shall be in the way and the almond tree 
shall flourish and the grasshopp shall be a burden and desir 
shall fail becau man goeth to hi long home and the mourner go 
about the street 12 6 or ever the silver cord be loo or the 
golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or 
the wheel broken at the cistern 

12 7 then shall the dust return to the earth a it wa and the spirit 
shall return unto god who gave it 

12 8 vaniti of vaniti saith the preacher all is vaniti 

12 9 and moreov becau the preacher wa wise he still taught the 
peopl knowledg yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in 
order mani proverb 

12 10 the preacher sought to find out accept word and that which 
wa written wa upright even word of truth 

12 11 the word of the wise are a goad and a nail fasten by the 
master of assembl which are given from one shepherd 

12 12 and further by these my son be admonish of make mani 
book there is no end and much studi is a weari of the flesh 

12 13 let u hear the conclu of the whole matter fear god and 
keep hi command for thi is the whole duti of man 

12 14 for god shall bring everi work into judgment with everi secret 
thing whether it be good or whether it be evil 




the song of solomon 


1 1 the song of song which is solomon s 

1 2 let him kiss me with the kiss of hi mouth for thi love is 
better than wine 

1 3 becau of the savour of thi good ointment thi name is a 
ointment pour forth therefor do the virgin love thee 

1 4 draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into hi 
chamber we will be glad and rejoic in thee we will rememb thi 
love more than wine the upright love thee 

1 5 i am black but come o ye daughter of jerusalem a the tent 
of kedar a the curtain of solomon 

1 6 look not upon me becau i am black becau the sun hath look 
upon me my mother s child were angri with me they made me the 
keeper of the vineyard but mine own vineyard have i not kept 

1 7 tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where

2 7 their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there ani 
end of their treasur their land is also full of hor neither is

of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glori of hi majesti 
when he ariseth to shake terribl the earth 

2 20 in that day a man shall cast hi idol of silver and hi idol 
of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the mole 
and to the bat 2 21 to go into the cleft of the rock and into the 
top of the rag rock for fear of the lord and for the glori of

2 22 cea ye from man whose breath is in hi nostril for wherein 
is he to be account of 3 1 for behold the lord the lord of 
host doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the 
staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water 

3 2 the mighti man and the man of war the judg and the prophet 
and the prudent and the ancient 3 3 the captain of fifti and the 
honour man and the counsellor and the cun artif and the

3 6 when a man shall take hold of hi brother of the hou of hi 
father say thou hast cloth be thou our ruler and let thi 
ruin be under thi hand 3 7 in that day shall he swear say i will 
not be an healer for in my hou is neither bread nor cloth make 
me not a ruler of the peopl 

3 8 for jerusalem is ruin and judah is fallen becau their tongu 
and their do are against the lord to provok the eye of hi 
glori 

3 9 the shew of their counten doth wit against them and they 
declar their sin a sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for 
they have reward evil unto themselv 

3 10 say ye to the righteou that it shall be well with him for they 
shall eat the fruit of their do

3 12 a for my peopl child are their oppressor and woman rule 
over them o my peopl they which lead thee cau thee to err and 
destroy the way of thi path 

3 13 the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judg the peopl 

3 14 the lord will enter into judgment with the ancient of hi 
peopl and the princ thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard 
the spoil of the poor is in your hou 

3 15 what mean ye that ye beat my peopl to piec and grind the 
face of the poor saith the lord god of host 

3 16 moreov the lord saith becau the daughter of zion are 
haughti and walk with stretch forth neck and wanton eye walk 
and minc a they go and make a tinkl with their foot 3 17 
therefor the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the 
daughter of zion and the lord will discov their secret part 

3 18 in that day the lord will take away the braveri of their tinkl 
ornament about their foot and their caul and their round tire 
like the moon 3 19 the chain and the bracelet and the muffler 
3 20 the bonnet and the ornament of the leg and the headband 
and the tablet and the ear 3 21 the ring and nose jewel 
3 22 the changeabl suit of apparel and the mantl and the 
wimpl and the crisp pin 3 23 the glass and the fine linen 
and the hood and the vail 

3 24 and it shall come to pa that instead of sweet smell there 
shall be stink and instead of a girdl a rent and instead of well 
set hair bald and instead of a stomach a gird of sackcloth 
and burn instead of beauti 

3 25 thi men shall fall by the sword and thi mighti in the war 

3 26 and her gate shall lament and mourn and she be desol 
shall sit upon the ground 

4 1 and in that day seven woman shall take hold of one man say we 
will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel onli let u be 
call by thi name to take away our reproach 

4 2 in that day shall the branch of the lord be beauti and 
gloriou and the fruit of the earth shall be excel and come for 
them that are escap of israel 

4 3 and it shall come to pa that he that is left in zion and he 
that remaineth in jerusalem shall be call holi even everi one that 
is written among the live in jerusalem 4 4 when the lord shall have 
wash away the filth of the daughter of zion and shall have purg 
the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of 
judgment and by the spirit of burn 

4 5 and the lord will creat upon everi dwell place of mount zion 
and upon her assembl a cloud and smoke by day and the shine of 
a flame fire by night for upon all the glori shall be a defenc 

4 6 and there shall be a tabernacl for a shadow in the day time from 
the heat and for a place of refug and for a covert from storm and 
from rain 

5 1 now will i sing to my wellbelov a song of my belov touch 
hi vineyard my wellbelov hath a vineyard in a veri fruit hill 
5 2 and he fenc it and gather out the stone thereof and plant 
it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and 
also made a winepress therein and he look that it should bring 
forth grape and it brought forth wild grape 

5 3 and now o inhabit of jerusalem and men of judah judg i 
pray you betwixt me and my vineyard 

5 4 what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not 
done in it wherefor when i look that it should bring forth 
grape brought it forth wild grape 5 5 and now go to i will tell 
you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedg thereof 
and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it 
shall be trodden down 5 6 and i will lay it wast it shall not be 
prune nor dig but there shall come up brier and thorn i will 
also command the cloud that they rain no rain upon it 

5 7 for the vineyard of the lord of host is the hou of israel and 
the men of judah hi pleasant plant and he look for judgment but 
behold oppress for righteou but behold a cri 

5 8 woe unto them that join hou to hou that lay field to field 
till there be no place that they may be place alon in the midst of 
the earth 5 9 in mine ear said the lord of host of a truth mani 
hou shall be desol even great and fair without inhabit 

5 10 yea ten acr of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of 
an homer shall yield an ephah 

5 11 woe unto them that rise up earli in the morn that they may 
follow strong drink that continu until night till wine inflam 
them 5 12 and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and 
wine are in their feast but they regard not the work of the lord 
neither consid the oper of hi hand 

5 13 therefor my peopl are gone into captiv becau they have no 
knowledg and their honour men are famish and their multitud 
dri up with thirst 

5 14 therefor hell hath enlarg herself and open her mouth 
without measur and their glori and their multitud and their pomp 
and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it 

5 15 and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighti man shall 
be humbl and the eye of the lofti shall be humbl 5 16 but the 
lord of host shall be exalt in judgment and god that is holi shall 
be sanctifi in righteou 

5 17 then shall the lamb feed after their manner and the wast 
place of the fat one shall stranger eat 

5 18 woe unto them that draw iniqu with cord of vaniti and sin a 
it were with a cart rope 5 19 that say let him make speed and 
hasten hi work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holi 
one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it 5 20 woe unto 
them that call evil good and good evil that put dark for light 
and light for dark that put bitter for sweet and sweet for 
bitter 5 21 woe unto them that are wise in their own eye and 
prudent in their own sight 5 22 woe unto them that are mighti to 
drink wine and men of strength to mingl strong drink 5 23 which 
justifi the wick for reward and take away the righteou of the 
righteou from him 5 24 therefor a the fire devoureth the stubbl 
and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be a 
rotten and their blossom shall go up a dust becau they have 
cast away the law of the lord of host and despi the word of the 
holi one of israel 

5 25 therefor is the anger of the lord kindl against hi peopl 
and he hath stretch forth hi hand against them and hath smitten 
them and the hill did trembl and their carca were torn in the 
midst of the street 

for all thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch 
out still 

5 26 and he will lift up an ensign to the nation from far and will 
hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come 
with speed swiftli 5 27 none shall be weari nor stumbl among them 
none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdl of their loin 
be loo nor the latchet of their shoe be broken 5 28 whose arrow 
are sharp and all their bow bent their hor hoof shall be 
count like flint and their wheel like a whirlwind 5 29 their 
roar shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lion yea 
they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carri it away 
safe and none shall deliv it 

5 30 and in that day they shall roar against them like the roar of 
the sea and if one look unto the land behold dark and sorrow 
and the light is darken in the heaven thereof 

6 1 in the year that king uzziah die i saw also the lord sit upon 
a throne high and lift up and hi train fill the templ 

6 2 abov it stood the seraph each one had six wing with twain 
he cover hi face and with twain he cover hi foot and with

lord of host the whole earth is full of hi glori 

6 4 and the post of the door move at the voic of him that cri 
and the hou wa fill with smoke 

6 5 then said i woe is me for i am undon becau i am a man of 
unclean lip and i dwell in the midst of a peopl of unclean lip 
for mine eye have seen the king the lord of host 

6 6 then flew one of the seraph unto me have a live coal in hi 
hand which he had taken with the tong from off the altar 6 7 and he 
laid it upon my mouth and said lo thi hath touch thi lip and 
thine iniqu is taken away and thi sin purg

7 1 and it came to pa in the day of ahaz the son of jotham the son 
of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the 
son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war

7 2 and it wa told the hou of david say syria is confed

counsel against thee say 7 6 let u go up against judah and vex 
it and let u make a breach therein for u and set a king in the 
midst of it even the son of tabeal 7 7 thu saith the lord god it 
shall not stand neither shall it come to pa 

7 8 for the head of syria is damascu and the head of damascu is 
rezin and within threescor and five year shall ephraim be broken 
that it be not a peopl 

7 9 and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is 
remaliah s son if ye will not believ sure ye shall not be 
establish 

7 10 moreov the lord spake again unto ahaz say 7 11 ask thee a 
sign of the lord thi god ask it either in the depth or in the height 
abov 

7 12 but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord 

7 13 and he said hear ye now o hou of david is it a small thing 
for you to weari men but will ye weari my god also 7 14 therefor 
the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall 
conceiv and bear a son and shall call hi name immanuel 

7 15 butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refu the 
evil and choo the good 

7 16 for befor the child shall know to refu the evil and choo

king 

7 17 the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thi peopl and upon thi 
father s hou day that have not come from the day that ephraim 
depart from judah even the king of assyria 

7 18 and it shall come to pa in that day that the lord shall hiss 
for the fli that is in the uttermost part of the river of egypt and 
for the bee that is in the land of assyria 

7 19 and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desol 
valley and in the hole of the rock and upon all thorn and upon 
all bush 

7 20 in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hire 
name by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head 
and the hair of the foot and it shall also consum the beard

7 25 and on all hill that shall be dig with the mattock there 
shall not come thither the fear of brier and thorn but it shall be 
for the send forth of ox and for the tread of lesser cattl 

8 1 moreov the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write 
in it with a man s pen concern mahershalalhashbaz 

8 2 and i took unto me faith wit to record uriah the priest 
and zechariah the son of jeberechiah 

8 3 and i went unto the prophetess and she conceiv and bare a son 

then said the lord to me call hi name mahershalalhashbaz 

8 4 for befor the child shall have knowledg to cri my father and 
my mother the rich of damascu and the spoil of samaria shall be 
taken away befor the king of assyria 

8 5 the lord spake also unto me again say 8 6 forasmuch a thi 
peopl refuseth the water of shiloah that go softli and rejoic in 
rezin and remaliah s son 8 7 now therefor behold the lord bringeth 
up upon them the water of the river strong and mani even the king 
of assyria and all hi glori and he shall come up over all hi 
channel and go over all hi bank 8 8 and he shall pa through 
judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck 
and the stretch out of hi wing shall fill the breadth of thi 
land o immanuel 

8 9 associ yourselv o ye peopl and ye shall be broken in 
piec and give ear all ye of far countri gird yourselv and ye 
shall be broken in piec gird yourselv and ye shall be broken in 
piec 

8 10 take counsel togeth and it shall come to nought speak the 
word and it shall not stand for god is with u 

8 11 for the lord spake thu to me with a strong hand and instruct 
me that i should not walk in the way of thi peopl say 8 12 say 
ye not a confederaci to all them to whom thi peopl shall say a 
confederaci neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid 

8 13 sanctifi the lord of host himself and let him be your fear and 
let him be your dread 

8 14 and he shall be for a sanctuari but for a stone of stumbl and 
for a rock of offenc to both the hou of israel for a gin and for 
a snare to the inhabit of jerusalem 

8 15 and mani among them shall stumbl and fall and be broken and 
be snare and be taken 

8 16 bind up the testimoni seal the law among my discipl 

8 17 and i will wait upon the lord that hideth hi face from the 
hou of jacob and i will look for him 

8 18 behold i and the child whom the lord hath given me are for 
sign and for wonder in israel from the lord of host which dwelleth 
in mount zion 

8 19 and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have 
familiar spirit and unto wizard that peep and that mutter should 
not a peopl seek unto their god for the live to the dead 8 20 to 
the law and to the testimoni if they speak not accord to thi 
word it is becau there is no light in them 

8 21 and they shall pa through it hardli bestead and hungri and it 
shall come to pa that when they shall be hungri they shall fret 
themselv and cur their king and their god and look upward 

8 22 and they shall look unto the earth and behold troubl and 
dark dim of anguish and they shall be driven to dark 

9 1 nevertheless the dim shall not be such a wa in her vexat 
when at the first he lightli afflict the land of zebulun and the 
land of naphtali and afterward did more grievou afflict her by the 
way of the sea beyond jordan in galil of the nation 

9 2 the peopl that walk in dark have seen a great light they 
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the 
light shine 

9 3 thou hast multipli the nation and not increa the joy they 
joy befor thee accord to the joy in harvest and a men rejoic 
when they divid the spoil 

9 4 for thou hast broken the yoke of hi burden and the staff of hi 
shoulder the rod of hi oppressor a in the day of midian 

9 5 for everi battl of the warrior is with confu noi and 
garment roll in blood but thi shall be with burn and fuel of 
fire 

9 6 for unto u a child is born unto u a son is given and the 
govern shall be upon hi shoulder and hi name shall be call 
wonder counsellor the mighti god the everlast father the 
princ of peac 

9 7 of the increa of hi govern and peac there shall be no end 
upon the throne of david and upon hi kingdom to order it and to 
establish it with judgment and with justic from henceforth even for 
ever the zeal of the lord of host will perform thi 

9 8 the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath light upon israel 

9 9 and all the peopl shall know even ephraim and the inhabit of 
samaria that say in the pride and stout of heart 9 10 the brick 
are fallen down but we will build with hewn stone the sycomor are 
cut down but we will chang them into cedar 

9 11 therefor the lord shall set up the adversari of rezin against 
him and join hi enemi togeth 9 12 the syrian befor and the 
philistin behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth for 
all thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out 
still 

9 13 for the peopl turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do 
they seek the lord of host 

9 14 therefor the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch 
and rush in one day 

9 15 the ancient and honour he is the head and the prophet that 
teacheth lie he is the tail 

9 16 for the leader of thi peopl cau them to err and they that 
are led of them are destroy 

9 17 therefor the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither 
shall have merci on their fatherless and widow for everi one is an 
hypocrit and an evildo and everi mouth speaketh folli for all 
thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out 
still 

9 18 for wick burneth a the fire it shall devour the brier 
and thorn and shall kindl in the thicket of the forest and they 
shall mount up like the lift up of smoke 

9 19 through the wrath of the lord of host is the land darken and 
the peopl shall be a the fuel of the fire no man shall spare hi 
brother 

9 20 and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungri and he 
shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfi they 
shall eat everi man the flesh of hi own arm 9 21 manasseh ephraim 
and ephraim manasseh and they togeth shall be against judah for 
all thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out 
still 

10 1 woe unto them that decr unright decr and that write 
grievou which they have prescrib 10 2 to turn asid the needi 
from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my peopl 
that widow may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless 
10 3 and what will ye do in the day of visit and in the 
desol which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help 
and where will ye leav your glori 10 4 without me they shall bow 
down under the prison and they shall fall under the slain for all 
thi hi anger is not turn away but hi hand is stretch out 
still 

10 5 o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is 
mine indign 

10 6 i will send him against an hypocrit nation and against the 
peopl of my wrath will i give him a charg to take the spoil and to 
take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the street 

10 7 howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth hi heart think so but 
it is in hi heart to destroy and cut off nation not a few 

10 8 for he saith are not my princ altogeth king 10 9 is not 
calno a carchemish is not hamath a arpad is not samaria a 
damascu 10 10 a my hand hath found the kingdom of the idol and 
whose graven imag did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria 10 11 
shall i not a i have done unto samaria and her idol so do to 
jerusalem and her idol 10 12 wherefor it shall come to pa that 
when the lord hath perform hi whole work upon mount zion and on 
jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of 
assyria and the glori of hi high look 

10 13 for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by 
my wisdom for i am prudent and i have remov the bound of the 
peopl and have rob their treasur and i have put down the 
inhabit like a valiant man 10 14 and my hand hath found a a nest 
the rich of the peopl and a one gathereth egg that are left 
have i gather all the earth and there wa none that move the wing 
or open the mouth or peep 

10 15 shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or 
shall the saw magnifi itself against him that shaketh it a if the 
rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or a if the 
staff should lift up itself a if it were no wood 

10 16 therefor shall the lord the lord of host send among hi fat 
one lean and under hi glori he shall kindl a burn like the 
burn of a fire 

10 17 and the light of israel shall be for a fire and hi holi one 
for a flame and it shall burn and devour hi thorn and hi brier in 
one day 10 18 and shall consum the glori of hi forest and of hi 
fruit field both soul and bodi and they shall be a when a 
standard bearer fainteth 

10 19 and the rest of the tree of hi forest shall be few that a 
child may write them 

10 20 and it shall come to pa in that day that the remnant of 
israel and such a are escap of the hou of jacob shall no more 
again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the 
holi one of israel in truth 

10 21 the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the 
mighti god 

10 22 for though thi peopl israel be a the sand of the sea yet a 
remnant of them shall return the consumpt decr shall overflow 
with righteou 

10 23 for the lord god of host shall make a consumpt even 
determin in the midst of all the land 

10 24 therefor thu saith the lord god of host o my peopl that 
dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee 
with a rod and shall lift up hi staff against thee after the manner 
of egypt 

10 25 for yet a veri littl while and the indign shall cea

10 26 and the lord of host shall stir up a scourg for him accord 
to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and a hi rod wa

10 27 and it shall come to pa in that day that hi burden shall be 
taken away from off thi shoulder and hi yoke from off thi neck and 
the yoke shall be destroy becau of the anoint 

10 28 he is come to aiath he is pa to migron at michmash he hath

10 33 behold the lord the lord of host shall lop the bough with 
terror and the high one of statur shall be hewn down and the 
haughti shall be humbl 

10 34 and he shall cut down the thicket of the forest with iron and 
lebanon shall fall by a mighti one 

11 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jess and a 
branch shall grow out of hi root 11 2 and the spirit of the lord 
shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understand the 
spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledg and of the fear 
of the lord 11 3 and shall make him of quick understand in the 
fear of the lord and he shall not judg after the sight of hi eye 
neither reprov after the hear of hi ear 11 4 but with 
righteou shall he judg the poor and reprov with equiti for the 
meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of hi 
mouth and with the breath of hi lip shall he slay the wick 

11 5 and righteou shall be the girdl of hi loin and 
faith the girdl of hi rein 

11 6 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall 
lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatl 
togeth and a littl child shall lead them 

11 7 and the cow and the bear shall feed their young one shall lie

wean child shall put hi hand on the cockatr den 

11 9 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holi mountain for the 
earth shall be full of the knowledg of the lord a the water cover

11 10 and in that day there shall be a root of jess which shall 
stand for an ensign of the peopl to it shall the gentil seek and 
hi rest shall be gloriou 

11 11 and it shall come to pa in that day that the lord shall set

which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathro 
and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and 
from the island of the sea 

11 12 and he shall set up an ensign for the nation and shall 
assembl the outcast of israel and gather togeth the disper of 
judah from the four corner of the earth 

11 13 the envi also of ephraim shall depart and the adversari of

26 16 lord in troubl have they visit thee they pour out a 
prayer when thi chasten wa upon them 

26 17 like a a woman with child that draweth near the time of her 
deliveri is in pain and crieth out in her pang so have we been in

dew of herb and the earth shall cast out the dead 

26 20 come my peopl enter thou into thi chamber and shut thi

the indign be overpast 

26 21 for behold the lord cometh out of hi place to punish the

disclo her blood and shall no more cover her slain 

27 1 in that day the lord with hi sore and great and strong sword 
shall punish leviathan the pierc serpent even leviathan that 
crook serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea 

27 2 in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine 

27 3 i the lord do keep it i will water it everi moment lest ani 
hurt it i will keep it night and day 

27 4 furi is not in me who would set the brier and thorn against me

27 5 or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peac with 
me and he shall make peac with me 

27 6 he shall cau them that come of jacob to take root israel shall 
blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit 

27 7 hath he smitten him a he smote those that smote him or is he 
slain accord to the slaughter of them that are slain by him 27 8 
in measur when it shooteth forth thou wilt debat with it he 
stayeth hi rough wind in the day of the east wind 

27 9 by thi therefor shall the iniqu of jacob be purg and thi 
is all the fruit to take away hi sin when he maketh all the stone 
of the altar a chalkston that are beaten in sunder the grove and 
imag shall not stand up 

27 10 yet the defenc citi shall be desol and the habit 
forsaken and left like a wilder there shall the calf feed and 
there shall he lie down and consum the branch thereof 

27 11 when the bough thereof are wither they shall be broken off 
the woman come and set them on fire for it is a peopl of no 
understand therefor he that made them will not have merci on 
them and he that form them will shew them no favour 

27 12 and it shall come to pa in that day that the lord shall beat 
off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye 
shall be gather one by one o ye child of israel 

27 13 and it shall come to pa in that day that the great trumpet 
shall be blown and they shall come which were readi to perish in the 
land of assyria and the outcast in the land of egypt and shall 
worship the lord in the holi mount at jerusalem 

28 1 woe to the crown of pride to the drunkard of ephraim whose 
gloriou beauti is a fade flower which are on the head of the fat 
valley of them that are overcom with wine 28 2 behold the lord 
hath a mighti and strong one which a a tempest of hail and a 
destroy storm a a flood of mighti water overflow shall cast 
down to the earth with the hand 

28 3 the crown of pride the drunkard of ephraim shall be trodden 
under foot 28 4 and the gloriou beauti which is on the head of the 
fat valley shall be a fade flower and a the hasti fruit befor 
the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet 
in hi hand he eateth it up 

28 5 in that day shall the lord of host be for a crown of glori and 
for a diadem of beauti unto the residu of hi peopl 28 6 and for a 
spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength 
to them that turn the battl to the gate 

28 7 but they also have er through wine and through strong drink 
are out of the way the priest and the prophet have er through 
strong drink they are swallow up of wine they are out of the way 
through strong drink they err in vision they stumbl in judgment 

28 8 for all tabl are full of vomit and filthi so that there is 
no place clean 

28 9 whom shall he teach knowledg and whom shall he make to 
understand doctrin them that are wean from the milk and drawn 
from the breast 

28 10 for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line 
upon line line upon line here a littl and there a littl 28 11 
for with stammer lip and anoth tongu will he speak to thi 
peopl 

28 12 to whom he said thi is the rest wherewith ye may cau the 
weari to rest and thi is the refresh yet they would not hear 

28 13 but the word of the lord wa unto them precept upon precept 
precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a littl 
and there a littl that they might go and fall backward and be 
broken and snare and taken 

28 14 wherefor hear the word of the lord ye scorn men that rule 
thi peopl which is in jerusalem 

28 15 becau ye have said we have made a coven with death and 
with hell are we at agreement when the overflow scourg shall pa 
through it shall not come unto u for we have made lie our refug 
and under falsehood have we hid ourselv 28 16 therefor thu saith 
the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundat a stone a tri 
stone a preciou corner stone a sure foundat he that believeth 
shall not make hast 

28 17 judgment also will i lay to the line and righteou to the 
plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refug of lie and the 
water shall overflow the hide place 

28 18 and your coven with death shall be disannul and your 
agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflow scourg 
shall pa through then ye shall be trodden down by it 

28 19 from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morn 
by morn shall it pa over by day and by night and it shall be a 
vexat onli to understand the report 

28 20 for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on 
it and the cover narrow than that he can wrap himself in it 

28 21 for the lord shall rise up a in mount perazim he shall be 
wroth a in the valley of gibeon that he may do hi work hi strang 
work and bring to pa hi act hi strang act 

28 22 now therefor be ye not mocker lest your band be made strong 
for i have heard from the lord god of host a consumpt even 
determin upon the whole earth 

28 23 give ye ear and hear my voic hearken and hear my speech 

28 24 doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the 
clod of hi ground 28 25 when he hath made plain the face thereof 
doth he not cast abroad the fitch and scatter the cummin and cast 
in the princip wheat and the appoint barley and the rie in their 
place 28 26 for hi god doth instruct him to discret and doth 
teach him 

28 27 for the fitch are not thresh with a thresh instrument 
neither is a cart wheel turn about upon the cummin but the fitch 
are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod 

28 28 bread corn is brui becau he will not ever be thresh it 
nor break it with the wheel of hi cart nor brui it with hi 
horseman 

28 29 thi also cometh forth from the lord of host which is 
wonder in counsel and excel in work 

29 1 woe to ariel to ariel the citi where david dwelt add ye year 
to year let them kill sacrif 

29 2 yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heavi and 
sorrow and it shall be unto me a ariel 

29 3 and i will camp against thee round about and will lay sieg 
against thee with a mount and i will rai fort against thee 

29 4 and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the 
ground and thi speech shall be low out of the dust and thi voic 
shall be a of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground 
and thi speech shall whisper out of the dust 

29 5 moreov the multitud of thi stranger shall be like small dust 
and the multitud of the terribl one shall be a chaff that passeth 
away yea it shall be at an instant suddenli 

29 6 thou shalt be visit of the lord of host with thunder and with 
earthquak and great noi with storm and tempest and the flame of 
devour fire 

29 7 and the multitud of all the nation that fight against ariel 
even all that fight against her and her munit and that distress 
her shall be a a dream of a night vision 

29 8 it shall even be a when an hungri man dreameth and behold he 
eateth but he awaketh and hi soul is empti or a when a thirsti 
man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold 
he is faint and hi soul hath appetit so shall the multitud of all 
the nation be that fight against mount zion 

29 9 stay yourselv and wonder cri ye out and cri they are 
drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink 

29 10 for the lord hath pour out upon you the spirit of deep sleep 
and hath close your eye the prophet and your ruler the seer 
hath he cover 

29 11 and the vision of all is becom unto you a the word of a book 
that is seal which men deliv to one that is learn say read 
thi i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is seal 29 12 and 
the book is deliv to him that is not learn say read thi i 
pray thee and he saith i am not learn 

29 13 wherefor the lord said forasmuch a thi peopl draw near me 
with their mouth and with their lip do honour me but have remov 
their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the 
precept of men 29 14 therefor behold i will proceed to do a 
marvel work among thi peopl even a marvel work and a 
wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the 
understand of their prudent men shall be hid 

29 15 woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the 
lord and their work are in the dark and they say who seeth u and 
who knoweth u 29 16 sure your turn of thing upsid down shall 
be esteem a the potter s clay for shall the work say of him that 
made it he made me not or shall the thing frame say of him that 
frame it he had no understand 29 17 is it not yet a veri littl 
while and lebanon shall be turn into a fruit field and the 
fruit field shall be esteem a a forest 29 18 and in that day 
shall the deaf hear the word of the book and the eye of the blind 
shall see out of obscur and out of dark 

29 19 the meek also shall increa their joy in the lord and the poor 
among men shall rejoic in the holi one of israel 

29 20 for the terribl one is brought to nought and the scorner is 
consum and all that watch for iniqu are cut off 29 21 that make 
a man an offend for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth 
in the gate and turn asid the just for a thing of nought 

29 22 therefor thu saith the lord who redeem abraham concern 
the hou of jacob jacob shall not now be asham neither shall hi 
face now wax pale 

29 23 but when he seeth hi child the work of mine hand in the 
midst of him they shall sanctifi my name and sanctifi the holi one 
of jacob and shall fear the god of israel 

29 24 they also that er in spirit shall come to understand and 
they that murmur shall learn doctrin 

30 1 woe to the rebelli child saith the lord that take 
counsel but not of me and that cover with a cover but not of my 
spirit that they may add sin to sin 30 2 that walk to go down into 
egypt and have not ask at my mouth to strengthen themselv in the 
strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt 30 3 
therefor shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust 
in the shadow of egypt your confu 

30 4 for hi princ were at zoan and hi ambassador came to hane 

30 5 they were all asham of a peopl that could not profit them nor 
be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach 

30 6 the burden of the beast of the south into the land of troubl 
and anguish from whenc come the young and old lion the viper and 
fieri fli serpent they will carri their rich upon the shoulder 
of young as and their treasur upon the bunch of camel to a 
peopl that shall not profit them 

30 7 for the egyptian shall help in vain and to no purpo 
therefor have i cri concern thi their strength is to sit 
still 

30 8 now go write it befor them in a tabl and note it in a book 
that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever 30 9 that thi 
is a rebelli peopl lie child child that will not hear 
the law of the lord 30 10 which say to the seer see not and to the 
prophet prophesi not unto u right thing speak unto u smooth 
thing prophesi deceit 30 11 get you out of the way turn asid out 
of the path cau the holi one of israel to cea from befor u 

30 12 wherefor thu saith the holi one of israel becau ye despi 
thi word and trust in oppress and perver and stay thereon 
30 13 therefor thi iniqu shall be to you a a breach readi to 
fall swell out in a high wall whose break cometh suddenli at 
an instant 

30 14 and he shall break it a the break of the potter vessel 
that is broken in piec he shall not spare so that there shall not 
be found in the burst of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth 
or to take water withal out of the pit 

30 15 for thu saith the lord god the holi one of israel in 
return and rest shall ye be save in quiet and in confid 
shall be your strength and ye would not 

30 16 but ye said no for we will flee upon hor therefor shall 
ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefor shall they that 
pursu you be swift 

30 17 one thousand shall flee at the rebuk of one at the rebuk of 
five shall ye flee till ye be left a a beacon upon the top of a 
mountain and a an ensign on an hill 

30 18 and therefor will the lord wait that he may be graciou unto 
you and therefor will he be exalt that he may have merci upon 
you for the lord is a god of judgment bless are all they that wait 
for him 

30 19 for the peopl shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep 
no more he will be veri graciou unto thee at the voic of thi cri 
when he shall hear it he will answer thee 

30 20 and though the lord give you the bread of adver and the 
water of afflict yet shall not thi teacher be remov into a 
corner ani more but thine eye shall see thi teacher 30 21 and 
thine ear shall hear a word behind thee say thi is the way 
walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the 
left 

30 22 ye shall defil also the cover of thi graven imag of 
silver and the ornament of thi molten imag of gold thou shalt cast 
them away a a menstruou cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee 
henc 

30 23 then shall he give the rain of thi seed that thou shalt sow the 
ground withal and bread of the increa of the earth and it shall be 
fat and plenteou in that day shall thi cattl feed in larg 
pastur 

30 24 the ox likewi and the young as that ear the ground shall 
eat clean provend which hath been winnow with the shovel and with 
the fan 

30 25 and there shall be upon everi high mountain and upon everi high 
hill river and stream of water in the day of the great slaughter 
when the tower fall 

30 26 moreov the light of the moon shall be a the light of the sun 
and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold a the light of seven 
day in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of hi peopl 
and healeth the stroke of their wound 

30 27 behold the name of the lord cometh from far burn with hi 
anger and the burden thereof is heavi hi lip are full of 
indign and hi tongu a a devour fire 30 28 and hi breath 
a an overflow stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to 
sift the nation with the siev of vaniti and there shall be a bridl 
in the jaw of the peopl cau them to err 

30 29 ye shall have a song a in the night when a holi solemn is 
kept and glad of heart a when one goeth with a pipe to come 
into the mountain of the lord to the mighti one of israel 

30 30 and the lord shall cau hi gloriou voic to be heard and 
shall shew the light down of hi arm with the indign of hi 
anger and with the flame of a devour fire with scatter and 
tempest and hailston 

30 31 for through the voic of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten 
down which smote with a rod 

30 32 and in everi place where the ground staff shall pa which 
the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabret and harp and 
in battl of shake will he fight with it 

30 33 for tophet is ordain of old yea for the king it is prepar 
he hath made it deep and larg the pile thereof is fire and much 
wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimston doth kindl 
it 

31 1 woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on hor 
and trust in chariot becau they are mani and in horseman becau 
they are veri strong but they look not unto the holi one of israel 
neither seek the lord 31 2 yet he also is wise and will bring evil 
and will not call back hi word but will ari against the hou of 
the evildo and against the help of them that work iniqu 

31 3 now the egyptian are men and not god and their hor flesh 
and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out hi hand both he that 
helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they 
all shall fail togeth 

31 4 for thu hath the lord spoken unto me like a the lion and the 
young lion roar on hi prey when a multitud of shepherd is 
call forth against him he will not be afraid of their voic nor 
aba himself for the noi of them so shall the lord of host come 
down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof 

31 5 a bird fli so will the lord of host defend jerusalem 
defend also he will deliv it and pa over he will preserv 
it 

31 6 turn ye unto him from whom the child of israel have deepli 
revolt 

31 7 for in that day everi man shall cast away hi idol of silver 
and hi idol of gold which your own hand have made unto you for a 
sin 

31 8 then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighti man 
and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee 
from the sword and hi young men shall be discomfit 

31 9 and he shall pa over to hi strong hold for fear and hi 
princ shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is 
in zion and hi furnac in jerusalem 

32 1 behold a king shall reign in righteou and princ shall 
rule in judgment 

32 2 and a man shall be a an hide place from the wind and a covert 
from the tempest a river of water in a dri place a the shadow of 
a great rock in a weari land 

32 3 and the eye of them that see shall not be dim and the ear of 
them that hear shall hearken 

32 4 the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledg and the 
tongu of the stammer shall be readi to speak plainli 

32 5 the vile person shall be no more call liber nor the churl 
said to be bounti 

32 6 for the vile person will speak villani and hi heart will work 
iniqu to practi hypocrisi and to utter error against the lord 
to make empti the soul of the hungri and he will cau the drink of 
the thirsti to fail 

32 7 the instrument also of the churl are evil he deviseth wick 
devic to destroy the poor with lie word even when the needi 
speaketh right 

32 8 but the liber deviseth liber thing and by liber thing 
shall he stand 

32 9 rise up ye woman that are at ea hear my voic ye careless

32 12 they shall lament for the teat for the pleasant field for 
the fruit vine 

32 13 upon the land of my peopl shall come up thorn and brier yea 
upon all the hou of joy in the joyou citi 32 14 becau the 
palac shall be forsaken the multitud of the citi shall be left 
the fort and tower shall be for den for ever a joy of wild as 
a pastur of flock 32 15 until the spirit be pour upon u from on 
high and the wilder be a fruit field and the fruit field

32 17 and the work of righteou shall be peac and the effect of 
righteou quiet and assur for ever 

32 18 and my peopl shall dwell in a peaceabl habit and in sure 
dwell and in quiet rest place 32 19 when it shall hail

36 1 now it came to pa in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that 
sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenc citi of 
judah and took them 

36 2 and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem 
unto king hezekiah with a great armi and he stood by the conduit of 
the upper pool in the highway of the fuller s field 

36 3 then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiah s son which wa over 
the hou and shebna the scribe and joah asaph s son the record 

36 4 and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thu saith 
the great king the king of assyria what confid is thi wherein 
thou trustest 36 5 i say sayest thou but they are but vain word 
i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that 
thou rebellest against me 36 6 lo thou trustest in the staff of 
thi broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into hi 
hand and pierc it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in 
him 

36 7 but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not 
he whose high place and whose altar hezekiah hath taken away and 
said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship befor thi altar 
36 8 now therefor give pledg i pray thee to my master the king of 
assyria and i will give thee two thousand hor if thou be abl on 
thi part to set rider upon them 

36 9 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least 
of my master s servant and put thi trust on egypt for chariot and 
for horseman 36 10 and am i now come up without the lord against 
thi land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against thi 
land and destroy it 

36 11 then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i 
pray thee unto thi servant in the syrian languag for we understand 
it and speak not to u in the jew languag in the ear of the 
peopl that are on the wall 

36 12 but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thi master and to 
thee to speak these word hath he not sent me to the men that sit 
upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own 
piss with you 36 13 then rabshakeh stood and cri with a loud 
voic in the jew languag and said hear ye the word of the great 
king the king of assyria 

36 14 thu saith the king let not hezekiah deceiv you for he shall 
not be abl to deliv you 

36 15 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord say the 
lord will sure deliv u thi citi shall not be deliv into the 
hand of the king of assyria 

36 16 hearken not to hezekiah for thu saith the king of assyria 
make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye 
everi one of hi vine and everi one of hi fig tree and drink ye 
everi one the water of hi own cistern 36 17 until i come and take 
you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land 
of bread and vineyard 

36 18 bewar lest hezekiah persuad you say the lord will deliv 
u 

hath ani of the god of the nation deliv hi land out of the hand 
of the king of assyria 36 19 where are the god of hamath and 
arphad where are the god of sepharvaim and have they deliv 
samaria out of my hand 36 20 who are they among all the god of 
these land that have deliv their land out of my hand that the 
lord should deliv jerusalem out of my hand 36 21 but they held 
their peac and answer him not a word for the king s command 
wa say answer him not 

36 22 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that wa over the 
household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the 
record to hezekiah with their cloth rent and told him the word 
of rabshakeh 

37 1 and it came to pa when king hezekiah heard it that he rent 
hi cloth and cover himself with sackcloth and went into the 
hou of the lord 

37 2 and he sent eliakim who wa over the household and shebna the 
scribe and the elder of the priest cover with sackcloth unto 
isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 

37 3 and they said unto him thu saith hezekiah thi day is a day of 
troubl and of rebuk and of blasphemi for the child are come to 
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth 

37 4 it may be the lord thi god will hear the word of rabshakeh whom 
the king of assyria hi master hath sent to reproach the live god 
and will reprov the word which the lord thi god hath heard 
wherefor lift up thi prayer for the remnant that is left 

37 5 so the servant of king hezekiah came to isaiah 

37 6 and isaiah said unto them thu shall ye say unto your master 
thu saith the lord be not afraid of the word that thou hast heard 
wherewith the servant of the king of assyria have blasphem me 

37 7 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour 
and return to hi own land and i will cau him to fall by the sword 
in hi own land 

37 8 so rabshakeh return and found the king of assyria war 
against libnah for he had heard that he wa depart from lachish 

37 9 and he heard say concern tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come 
forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messeng 
to hezekiah say 37 10 thu shall ye speak to hezekiah king of 
judah say let not thi god in whom thou trustest deceiv thee 
say jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of 
assyria 

37 11 behold thou hast heard what the king of assyria have done to 
all land by destroy them utterli and shalt thou be deliv 
37 12 have the god of the nation deliv them which my father 
have destroy a gozan and haran and rezeph and the child of 
eden which were in telassar 37 13 where is the king of hamath and 
the king of arphad and the king of the citi of sepharvaim hena and 
ivah 37 14 and hezekiah receiv the letter from the hand of the 
messeng and read it and hezekiah went up unto the hou of the 
lord and spread it befor the lord 

37 15 and hezekiah pray unto the lord say 37 16 o lord of 
host god of israel that dwellest between the cherub thou art 
the god even thou alon of all the kingdom of the earth thou hast 
made heaven and earth 

37 17 inclin thine ear o lord and hear open thine eye o lord 
and see and hear all the word of sennacherib which hath sent to

37 18 of a truth lord the king of assyria have laid wast all the

fire for they were no god but the work of men s hand wood and 
stone therefor they have destroy them 

37 20 now therefor o lord our god save u from hi hand that all 
the kingdom of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou

37 21 then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah say thu

sennacherib king of assyria 37 22 thi is the word which the lord 
hath spoken concern him the virgin the daughter of zion hath 
despi thee and laugh thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem

the holi one of israel 

37 24 by thi servant hast thou reproach the lord and hast said by 
the multitud of my chariot am i come up to the height of the 
mountain to the side of lebanon and i will cut down the tall 
cedar thereof and the choic fir tree thereof and i will enter

37 25 i have dig and drunk water and with the sole of my foot

37 26 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient 
time that i have form it now have i brought it to pa that thou

37 27 therefor their inhabit were of small power they were

the green herb a the grass on the housetop and a corn blast 
befor it be grown up 

37 28 but i know thi abod and thi go out and thi come in and

37 29 becau thi rage against me and thi tumult is come up into

37 30 and thi shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat thi year such 
a groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the 
same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyard and 
eat the fruit thereof 

37 31 and the remnant that is escap of the hou of judah shall 
again take root downward and bear fruit upward 37 32 for out of 
jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escap out of mount 
zion the zeal of the lord of host shall do thi 

37 33 therefor thu saith the lord concern the king of assyria he 
shall not come into thi citi nor shoot an arrow there nor come

37 34 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall 
not come into thi citi saith the lord 

37 35 for i will defend thi citi to save it for mine own sake and

37 36 then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of 
the assyrian a hundr and fourscor and five thousand and when they

37 37 so sennacherib king of assyria depart and went and return

38 20 the lord wa readi to save me therefor we will sing my song 
to the string instrument all the day of our life in the hou of

38 22 hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to

mouth and draw out the tongu are ye not child of transgress 
a seed of falsehood 

57 5 enflam yourselv with idol under everi green tree slay 
the child in the valley under the clift of the rock 57 6 among 
the smooth stone of the stream is thi portion they they are thi 
lot even to them hast thou pour a drink offer thou hast offer 
a meat offer should i receiv comfort in these 57 7 upon a lofti 
and high mountain hast thou set thi bed even thither wentest thou up 
to offer sacrif 

57 8 behind the door also and the post hast thou set up thi 
remembr for thou hast discov thyself to anoth than me and 
art gone up thou hast enlarg thi bed and made thee a coven with 
them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it 

57 9 and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increa 
thi perfum and didst send thi messeng far off and didst deba 
thyself even unto hell 

57 10 thou art weari in the great of thi way yet saidst thou 
not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand 
therefor thou wast not griev 

57 11 and of whom hast thou been afraid or fear that thou hast

shall carri them all away vaniti shall take them but he that putteth 
hi trust in me shall po the land and shall inherit my holi 
mountain 57 14 and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepar the 
way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my peopl 

57 15 for thu saith the high and lofti one that inhabiteth etern 
whose name is holi i dwell in the high and holi place with him also 
that is of a contrit and humbl spirit to reviv the spirit of the 
humbl and to reviv the heart of the contrit one 

57 16 for i will not contend for ever neither will i be alway wroth 
for the spirit should fail befor me and the soul which i have made 

57 17 for the iniqu of hi covet wa i wroth and smote him 
i hid me and wa wroth and he went on frowardli in the way of hi 
heart 

57 18 i have seen hi way and will heal him i will lead him also 
and restor comfort unto him and to hi mourner 

57 19 i creat the fruit of the lip peac peac to him that is far 
off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him 

57 20 but the wick are like the troubl sea when it cannot rest 
whose water cast up mire and dirt 

57 21 there is no peac saith my god to the wick 

58 1 cri aloud spare not lift up thi voic like a trumpet and shew 
my peopl their transgress and the hou of jacob their sin 

58 2 yet they seek me daili and delight to know my way a a nation 
that did righteou and forsook not the ordin of their god 
they ask of me the ordin of justic they take delight in 
approach to god 

58 3 wherefor have we fast say they and thou seest not wherefor 
have we afflict our soul and thou takest no knowledg behold in 
the day of your fast ye find pleasur and exact all your labour 

58 4 behold ye fast for strife and debat and to smite with the fist 
of wick ye shall not fast a ye do thi day to make your voic 
to be heard on high 

58 5 is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict 
hi soul is it to bow down hi head a a bulrush and to spread 
sackcloth and ash under him wilt thou call thi a fast and an 
accept day to the lord 58 6 is not thi the fast that i have 
chosen to loo the band of wick to undo the heavi burden 
and to let the oppress go free and that ye break everi yoke 58 7 
is it not to deal thi bread to the hungri and that thou bring the 
poor that are cast out to thi hou when thou seest the nake that 
thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh 
58 8 then shall thi light break forth a the morn and thine health 
shall spring forth speedili and thi righteou shall go befor 
thee the glori of the lord shall be thi rereward 

58 9 then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cri 
and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee 
the yoke the put forth of the finger and speak vaniti 58 10 
and if thou draw out thi soul to the hungri and satisfi the afflict 
soul then shall thi light rise in obscur and thi dark be a 
the noon day 58 11 and the lord shall guid thee continu and 
satisfi thi soul in drought and make fat thi bone and thou shalt be 
like a water garden and like a spring of water whose water fail 
not 

58 12 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old wast place 
thou shalt rai up the foundat of mani gener and thou 
shalt be call the repair of the breach the restor of path to 
dwell in 

58 13 if thou turn away thi foot from the sabbath from do thi 
pleasur on my holi day and call the sabbath a delight the holi of 
the lord honour and shalt honour him not do thine own way 
nor find thine own pleasur nor speak thine own word 58 14 
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cau thee to 
ride upon the high place of the earth and feed thee with the 
heritag of jacob thi father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken 
it 

59 1 behold the lord s hand is not shorten that it cannot save 
neither hi ear heavi that it cannot hear 59 2 but your iniqu 
have separ between you and your god and your sin have hid hi 
face from you that he will not hear 

59 3 for your hand are defil with blood and your finger with 
iniqu your lip have spoken lie your tongu hath mutter 
perver 

59 4 none calleth for justic nor ani pleadeth for truth they trust 
in vaniti and speak lie they conceiv mischief and bring forth 
iniqu 

59 5 they hatch cockatr egg and weav the spider s web he that 
eateth of their egg dieth and that which is crush breaketh out 
into a viper 

59 6 their web shall not becom garment neither shall they cover 
themselv with their work their work are work of iniqu and 
the act of violenc is in their hand 

59 7 their foot run to evil and they make hast to shed innoc 
blood their thought are thought of iniqu wast and 
destruct are in their path 

59 8 the way of peac they know not and there is no judgment in their 
go they have made them crook path whosoev goeth therein 
shall not know peac 

59 9 therefor is judgment far from u neither doth justic overtak 
u we wait for light but behold obscur for bright but we 
walk in dark 

59 10 we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope a if we had 
no eye we stumbl at noon day a in the night we are in desol 
place a dead men 

59 11 we roar all like bear and mourn sore like dove we look for 
judgment but there is none for salvat but it is far off from u 

59 12 for our transgress are multipli befor thee and our sin 
testifi against u for our transgress are with u and a for our 
iniqu we know them 59 13 in transgress and lie against the 
lord and depart away from our god speak oppress and revolt 
conceiv and utter from the heart word of falsehood 

59 14 and judgment is turn away backward and justic standeth afar 
off for truth is fallen in the street and equiti cannot enter 

59 15 yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh 
himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displea him that there 
wa no judgment 

59 16 and he saw that there wa no man and wonder that there wa no 
intercessor therefor hi arm brought salvat unto him and hi 
righteou it sustain him 

59 17 for he put on righteou a a breastplat and an helmet of 
salvat upon hi head and he put on the garment of vengeanc for 
cloth and wa clad with zeal a a cloak 

59 18 accord to their deed accordingli he will repay furi to hi 
adversari recomp to hi enemi to the island he will repay 
recomp 

59 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and hi 
glori from the rise of the sun when the enemi shall come in like a 
flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him 

59 20 and the redeem shall come to zion and unto them that turn 
from transgress in jacob saith the lord 

59 21 a for me thi is my coven with them saith the lord my 
spirit that is upon thee and my word which i have put in thi mouth

4 8 for thi gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierc 
anger of the lord is not turn back from u 

4 9 and it shall come to pa at that day saith the lord that the 
heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princ and the

4 10 then said i ah lord god sure thou hast greatli deceiv thi 
peopl and jerusalem say ye shall have peac wherea the sword 
reacheth unto the soul 

4 11 at that time shall it be said to thi peopl and to jerusalem a

my peopl not to fan nor to clean 4 12 even a full wind from 
those place shall come unto me now also will i give sentenc against

4 20 destruct upon destruct is cri for the whole land is 
spoil suddenli are my tent spoil and my curtain in a moment 

4 21 how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the 
trumpet 4 22 for my peopl is foolish they have not known me they 
are sottish child and they have none understand they are wise 
to do evil but to do good they have no knowledg 

4 23 i beheld the earth and lo it wa without form and void and 
the heaven and they had no light 

4 24 i beheld the mountain and lo they trembl and all the hill 
move lightli 

4 25 i beheld and lo there wa no man and all the bird of the 
heaven were fled 

4 26 i beheld and lo the fruit place wa a wilder and all 
the citi thereof were broken down at the presenc of the lord and 
by hi fierc anger 

4 27 for thu hath the lord said the whole land shall be desol 
yet will i not make a full end 

4 28 for thi shall the earth mourn and the heaven abov be black 
becau i have spoken it i have purpo it and will not repent 
neither will i turn back from it 

4 29 the whole citi shall flee for the noi of the horseman and 
bowman they shall go into thicket and climb up upon the rock 
everi citi shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein 

4 30 and when thou art spoil what wilt thou do though thou 
clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornament 
of gold though thou rentest thi face with paint in vain shalt 
thou make thyself fair thi lover will despi thee they will seek

4 31 for i have heard a voic a of a woman in travail and the 
anguish a of her that bringeth forth her first child the voic of 
the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her 
hand say woe is me now for my soul is weari becau of 
murder 

5 1 run ye to and fro through the street of jerusalem and see now 
and know and seek in the broad place thereof if ye can find a man 
if there be ani that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i 
will pardon it 

5 2 and though they say the lord liveth sure they swear fal 

5 3 o lord are not thine eye upon the truth thou hast stricken 
them but they have not griev thou hast consum them but they 
have refu to receiv correct they have made their face harder 
than a rock they have refu to return 

5 4 therefor i said sure these are poor they are foolish for 
they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god 

5 5 i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for 
they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god 
but these have altogeth broken the yoke and burst the bond 

5 6 wherefor a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of 
the even shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their 
citi everi one that goeth out thenc shall be torn in piec 
becau their transgress are mani and their backslid are 
increa 

5 7 how shall i pardon thee for thi thi child have forsaken me 
and sworn by them that are no god when i had fed them to the full 
they then commit adulteri and assembl themselv by troop in 
the harlot hou 

5 8 they were a fed hor in the morn everi one neigh after 
hi neighbour s wife 

5 9 shall i not visit for these thing saith the lord and shall not 
my soul be aveng on such a nation a thi 5 10 go ye up upon her 
wall and destroy but make not a full end take away her 
battlement for they are not the lord s 

5 11 for the hou of israel and the hou of judah have dealt veri 
treacher against me saith the lord 

5 12 they have beli the lord and said it is not he neither shall 
evil come upon u neither shall we see sword nor famin 5 13 and the 
prophet shall becom wind and the word is not in them thu shall it 
be done unto them 

5 14 wherefor thu saith the lord god of host becau ye speak thi 
word behold i will make my word in thi mouth fire and thi peopl 
wood and it shall devour them 

5 15 lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o hou of israel 
saith the lord it is a mighti nation it is an ancient nation a 
nation whose languag thou knowest not neither understandest what 
they say 

5 16 their quiver is a an open sepulchr they are all mighti men 

5 17 and they shall eat up thine harvest and thi bread which thi 
son and thi daughter should eat they shall eat up thi flock and 
thine herd they shall eat up thi vine and thi fig tree they shall 
impoverish thi fenc citi wherein thou trustedst with the sword 

5 18 nevertheless in those day saith the lord i will not make a 
full end with you 

5 19 and it shall come to pa when ye shall say wherefor doeth the 
lord our god all these thing unto u then shalt thou answer them 
like a ye have forsaken me and serv strang god in your land so 
shall ye serv stranger in a land that is not your s 

5 20 declar thi in the hou of jacob and publish it in judah 
say 5 21 hear now thi o foolish peopl and without 
understand which have eye and see not which have ear and hear 
not 5 22 fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not trembl at my 
presenc which have place the sand for the bound of the sea by a 
perpetu decr that it cannot pa it and though the wave thereof 
toss themselv yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can 
they not pa over it 5 23 but thi peopl hath a revolt and a 
rebelli heart they are revolt and gone 

5 24 neither say they in their heart let u now fear the lord our 
god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in hi season 
he reserveth unto u the appoint week of the harvest 

5 25 your iniqu have turn away these thing and your sin have 
withholden good thing from you 

5 26 for among my peopl are found wick men they lay wait a he 
that setteth snare they set a trap they catch men 

5 27 a a cage is full of bird so are their hou full of deceit 
therefor they are becom great and waxen rich 

5 28 they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deed of 
the wick they judg not the cau the cau of the fatherless yet 
they prosper and the right of the needi do they not judg 

5 29 shall i not visit for these thing saith the lord shall not my 
soul be aveng on such a nation a thi 5 30 a wonder and 
horribl thing is commit in the land 5 31 the prophet prophesi 
fal and the priest bear rule by their mean and my peopl love 
to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof 6 1 o ye 
child of benjamin gather yourselv to flee out of the midst of 
jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire in 
bethhaccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and great 
destruct 

6 2 i have liken the daughter of zion to a come and delic 
woman 

6 3 the shepherd with their flock shall come unto her they shall 
pitch their tent against her round about they shall feed everi one 
in hi place 

6 4 prepar ye war against her ari and let u go up at noon woe 
unto u for the day goeth away for the shadow of the even are 
stretch out 

6 5 ari and let u go by night and let u destroy her palac 

6 6 for thu hath the lord of host said hew ye down tree and cast 
a mount against jerusalem thi is the citi to be visit she is 
wholli oppress in the midst of her 

6 7 a a fountain casteth out her water so she casteth out her 
wick violenc and spoil is heard in her befor me continu 
is grief and wound 

6 8 be thou instruct o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee 
lest i make thee desol a land not inhabit 

6 9 thu saith the lord of host they shall throughli glean the 
remnant of israel a a vine turn back thine hand a a grapegath 
into the basket 

6 10 to whom shall i speak and give warn that they may hear 
behold their ear is uncircumci and they cannot hearken behold 
the word of the lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight in 
it 

6 11 therefor i am full of the furi of the lord i am weari with 
hold in i will pour it out upon the child abroad and upon the 
assembl of young men togeth for even the husband with the wife 
shall be taken the age with him that is full of day 

6 12 and their hou shall be turn unto other with their field 
and wife togeth for i will stretch out my hand upon the 
inhabit of the land saith the lord 

6 13 for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them everi 
one is given to covet and from the prophet even unto the 
priest everi one dealeth fal 

6 14 they have heal also the hurt of the daughter of my peopl 
slightli say peac peac when there is no peac 

6 15 were they asham when they had commit abomin nay they 
were not at all asham neither could they blush therefor they 
shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they 
shall be cast down saith the lord 

6 16 thu saith the lord stand ye in the way and see and ask for 
the old path where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall 
find rest for your soul but they said we will not walk therein 

6 17 also i set watchman over you say hearken to the sound of the 
trumpet but they said we will not hearken 

6 18 therefor hear ye nation and know o congreg what is

6 19 hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon thi peopl even 
the fruit of their thought becau they have not hearken unto my 
word nor to my law but reject it 

6 20 to what purpo cometh there to me incen from sheba and the 
sweet cane from a far countri your burnt offer are not 
accept nor your sacrif sweet unto me 

6 21 therefor thu saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblock 
befor thi peopl and the father and the son togeth shall fall 
upon them the neighbour and hi friend shall perish 

6 22 thu saith the lord behold a peopl cometh from the north 
countri and a great nation shall be rai from the side of the 
earth 

6 23 they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no 
merci their voic roareth like the sea and they ride upon hor 
set in array a men for war against thee o daughter of zion 

6 24 we have heard the fame thereof our hand wax feebl anguish 
hath taken hold of u and pain a of a woman in travail

and your do and i will cau you to dwell in thi place 

7 4 trust ye not in lie word say the templ of the lord the 
templ of the lord the templ of the lord are these 

7 5 for if ye throughli amend your way and your do if ye 
throughli execut judgment between a man and hi neighbour 7 6 if ye 
oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not 
innoc blood in thi place neither walk after other god to your 
hurt 7 7 then will i cau you to dwell in thi place in the land 
that i gave to your father for ever and ever 

7 8 behold ye trust in lie word that cannot profit 

7 9 will ye steal murder and commit adulteri and swear fal and 
burn incen unto baal and walk after other god whom ye know not 
7 10 and come and stand befor me in thi hou which is call by my 
name and say we are deliv to do all these abomin 7 11 is 
thi hou which is call by my name becom a den of robber in 
your eye behold even i have seen it saith the lord 

7 12 but go ye now unto my place which wa in shiloh where i set my 
name at the first and see what i did to it for the wick of my 
peopl israel 

7 13 and now becau ye have done all these work saith the lord 
and i spake unto you rise up earli and speak but ye heard not 
and i call you but ye answer not 7 14 therefor will i do unto 
thi hou which is call by my name wherein ye trust and unto the 
place which i gave to you and to your father a i have done to 
shiloh 

7 15 and i will cast you out of my sight a i have cast out all your 
brother even the whole seed of ephraim 

7 16 therefor pray not thou for thi peopl neither lift up cri nor 
prayer for them neither make intercess to me for i will not hear 
thee 

7 17 seest thou not what they do in the citi of judah and in the 
street of jerusalem 7 18 the child gather wood and the father 
kindl the fire and the woman knead their dough to make cake to the 
queen of heaven and to pour out drink offer unto other god that 
they may provok me to anger 

7 19 do they provok me to anger saith the lord do they not provok 
themselv to the confu of their own face 7 20 therefor thu 
saith the lord god behold mine anger and my furi shall be pour out 
upon thi place upon man and upon beast and upon the tree of the 
field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall 
not be quench 

7 21 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel put your burnt 
offer unto your sacrif and eat flesh 

7 22 for i spake not unto your father nor command them in the day 
that i brought them out of the land of egypt concern burnt 
offer or sacrif 7 23 but thi thing command i them say 
obey my voic and i will be your god and ye shall be my peopl and 
walk ye in all the way that i have command you that it may be well 
unto you 

7 24 but they hearken not nor inclin their ear but walk in the 
counsel and in the imagin of their evil heart and went 
backward and not forward 

7 25 sinc the day that your father came forth out of the land of 
egypt unto thi day i have even sent unto you all my servant the 
prophet daili rise up earli and send them 7 26 yet they 
hearken not unto me nor inclin their ear but harden their 
neck they did wor than their father 

7 27 therefor thou shalt speak all these word unto them but they 
will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they 
will not answer thee 

7 28 but thou shalt say unto them thi is a nation that obeyeth not 
the voic of the lord their god nor receiveth correct truth is 
perish and is cut off from their mouth 

7 29 cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a 
lament on high place for the lord hath reject and forsaken 
the gener of hi wrath 

7 30 for the child of judah have done evil in my sight saith the 
lord they have set their abomin in the hou which is call by 
my name to pollut it 

7 31 and they have built the high place of tophet which is in the 
valley of the son of hinnom to burn their son and their daughter in 
the fire which i command them not neither came it into my heart 

7 32 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that it shall 
no more be call tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the 
valley of slaughter for they shall buri in tophet till there be no 
place 

7 33 and the carca of thi peopl shall be meat for the fowl of 
the heaven and for the beast of the earth and none shall fray them 
away 

7 34 then will i cau to cea from the citi of judah and from the 
street of jerusalem the voic of mirth and the voic of glad 
the voic of the bridegroom and the voic of the bride for the land 
shall be desol 

8 1 at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bone of 
the king of judah and the bone of hi princ and the bone of the 
priest and the bone of the prophet and the bone of the 
inhabit of jerusalem out of their graf 8 2 and they shall 
spread them befor the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven 
whom they have love and whom they have serv and after whom they 
have walk and whom they have sought and whom they have worship 
they shall not be gather nor be buri they shall be for dung upon 
the face of the earth 

8 3 and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residu of 
them that remain of thi evil famili which remain in all the place 
whither i have driven them saith the lord of host 

8 4 moreov thou shalt say unto them thu saith the lord shall they 
fall and not ari shall he turn away and not return 8 5 whi then 
is thi peopl of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetu backslid 
they hold fast deceit they refu to return 

8 6 i hearken and heard but they spake not aright no man repent 
him of hi wick say what have i done everi one turn to 
hi cour a the hor rusheth into the battl 

8 7 yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appoint time and the 
turtl and the crane and the swallow observ the time of their come 
but my peopl know not the judgment of the lord 

8 8 how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with u 
lo certainli in vain made he it the pen of the scribe is in vain 

8 9 the wise men are asham they are dismay and taken lo they 
have reject the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them 8 10 
therefor will i give their wife unto other and their field to 
them that shall inherit them for everi one from the least even unto 
the greatest is given to covet from the prophet even unto the 
priest everi one dealeth fal 

8 11 for they have heal the hurt of the daughter of my peopl 
slightli say peac peac when there is no peac 

8 12 were they asham when they had commit abomin nay they 
were not at all asham neither could they blush therefor shall 
they fall among them that fall in the time of their visit they 
shall be cast down saith the lord 

8 13 i will sure consum them saith the lord there shall be no 
grape on the vine nor fig on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade 
and the thing that i have given them shall pa away from them 

8 14 whi do we sit still assembl yourselv and let u enter into 
the defenc citi and let u be silent there for the lord our god 
hath put u to silenc and given u water of gall to drink becau 
we have sin against the lord 

8 15 we look for peac but no good came and for a time of health 
and behold troubl 8 16 the snort of hi hor wa heard from 
dan the whole land trembl at the sound of the neigh of hi 
strong one for they are come and have devour the land and all 
that is in it the citi and those that dwell therein 

8 17 for behold i will send serpent cockatr among you which 
will not be charm and they shall bite you saith the lord 

8 18 when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in 
me 

8 19 behold the voic of the cri of the daughter of my peopl becau 
of them that dwell in a far countri is not the lord in zion is not 
her king in her whi have they provok me to anger with their graven 
imag and with strang vaniti 8 20 the harvest is past the 
summer is end and we are not save 

8 21 for the hurt of the daughter of my peopl am i hurt i am black 
astonish hath taken hold on me 

8 22 is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there whi then 
is not the health of the daughter of my peopl recov 9 1 oh that 
my head were water and mine eye a fountain of tear that i might 
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my peopl 9 2 oh 
that i had in the wilder a lodg place of wayfar men that i 
might leav my peopl and go from them for they be all adult 
an assembl of treacher men 

9 3 and they bend their tongu like their bow for lie but they are 
not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil 
to evil and they know not me saith the lord 

9 4 take ye heed everi one of hi neighbour and trust ye not in ani 
brother for everi brother will utterli supplant and everi neighbour 
will walk with slander 

9 5 and they will deceiv everi one hi neighbour and will not speak 
the truth they have taught their tongu to speak lie and weari 
themselv to commit iniqu 

9 6 thine habit is in the midst of deceit through deceit they 
refu to know me saith the lord 

9 7 therefor thu saith the lord of host behold i will melt them 
and tri them for how shall i do for the daughter of my peopl 9 8 
their tongu is a an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh 
peaceabl to hi neighbour with hi mouth but in heart he layeth hi 
wait 

9 9 shall i not visit them for these thing saith the lord shall not 
my soul be aveng on such a nation a thi 9 10 for the mountain 
will i take up a weep and wail and for the habit of the 
wilder a lament becau they are burn up so that none can 
pa through them neither can men hear the voic of the cattl both 
the fowl of the heaven and the beast are fled they are gone 

9 11 and i will make jerusalem heap and a den of dragon and i will 
make the citi of judah desol without an inhabit 

9 12 who is the wise man that may understand thi and who is he to 
whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declar it for 
what the land perisheth and is burn up like a wilder that none 
passeth through 9 13 and the lord saith becau they have forsaken 
my law which i set befor them and have not obey my voic neither 
walk therein 9 14 but have walk after the imagin of their 
own heart and after baalim which their father taught them 9 15 
therefor thu saith the lord of host the god of israel behold i 
will feed them even thi peopl with wormwood and give them water 
of gall to drink 

9 16 i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor 
their father have known and i will send a sword after them till i 
have consum them 

9 17 thu saith the lord of host consid ye and call for the 
mourn woman that they may come and send for cun woman that 
they may come 9 18 and let them make hast and take up a wail for 
u that our eye may run down with tear and our eyelid gush out 
with water 

9 19 for a voic of wail is heard out of zion how are we spoil 
we are greatli confound becau we have forsaken the land becau 
our dwell have cast u out 

9 20 yet hear the word of the lord o ye woman and let your ear 
receiv the word of hi mouth and teach your daughter wail and 
everi one her neighbour lament 

9 21 for death is come up into our window and is enter into our 
palac to cut off the child from without and the young men from 
the street 

9 22 speak thu saith the lord even the carca of men shall fall 
a dung upon the open field and a the hand after the harvestman 
and none shall gather them 

9 23 thu saith the lord let not the wise man glori in hi wisdom 
neither let the mighti man glori in hi might let not the rich man 
glori in hi rich 9 24 but let him that glorieth glori in thi 
that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which 
exerci lovingkind judgment and righteou in the earth 
for in these thing i delight saith the lord 

9 25 behold the day come saith the lord that i will punish all 
them which are circumci with the uncircumci 9 26 egypt and 
judah and edom and the child of ammon and moab and all that are 
in the utmost corner that dwell in the wilder for all these 
nation are uncircumci and all the hou of israel are 
uncircumci in the heart 

10 1 hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o hou of 
israel 10 2 thu saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen 
and be not dismay at the sign of heaven for the heathen are 
dismay at them 

10 3 for the custom of the peopl are vain for one cutteth a tree 
out of the forest the work of the hand of the workman with the axe 

10 4 they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nail 
and with hammer that it move not 

10 5 they are upright a the palm tree but speak not they must need 
be born becau they cannot go be not afraid of them for they 
cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good 

10 6 forasmuch a there is none like unto thee o lord thou art 
great and thi name is great in might 

10 7 who would not fear thee o king of nation for to thee doth it 
appertain forasmuch a among all the wise men of the nation and in 
all their kingdom there is none like unto thee 

10 8 but they are altogeth brutish and foolish the stock is a 
doctrin of vaniti 

10 9 silver spread into plate is brought from tarshish and gold from 
uphaz the work of the workman and of the hand of the founder blue 
and purpl is their cloth they are all the work of cun men 

10 10 but the lord is the true god he is the live god and an 
everlast king at hi wrath the earth shall trembl and the 
nation shall not be abl to abid hi indign 

10 11 thu shall ye say unto them the god that have not made the

11 1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord say 11 2 hear ye 
the word of thi coven and speak unto the men of judah and to 
the inhabit of jerusalem 11 3 and say thou unto them thu saith 
the lord god of israel cur be the man that obeyeth not the word 
of thi coven 11 4 which i command your father in the day that 
i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnac 
say obey my voic and do them accord to all which i command 
you so shall ye be my peopl and i will be your god 11 5 that i may 
perform the oath which i have sworn unto your father to give them a 
land flow with milk and honey a it is thi day then answer i 
and said so be it o lord 

11 6 then the lord said unto me proclaim all these word in the 
citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem say hear ye the 
word of thi coven and do them 

11 7 for i earnestli protest unto your father in the day that i 
brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto thi day rise 
earli and protest say obey my voic 

11 8 yet they obey not nor inclin their ear but walk everi one 
in the imagin of their evil heart therefor i will bring upon 
them all the word of thi coven which i command them to do but 
they did them not 

11 9 and the lord said unto me a conspiraci is found among the men of 
judah and among the inhabit of jerusalem 

11 10 they are turn back to the iniqu of their forefath 
which refu to hear my word and they went after other god to 
serv them the hou of israel and the hou of judah have broken my 
coven which i made with their father 

11 11 therefor thu saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon 
them which they shall not be abl to escap and though they shall 
cri unto me i will not hearken unto them 

11 12 then shall the citi of judah and inhabit of jerusalem go 
and cri unto the god unto whom they offer incen but they shall not 
save them at all in the time of their troubl 

11 13 for accord to the number of thi citi were thi god o 
judah and accord to the number of the street of jerusalem have ye 
set up altar to that shame thing even altar to burn incen unto 
baal 

11 14 therefor pray not thou for thi peopl neither lift up a cri 
or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cri 
unto me for their troubl 

11 15 what hath my belov to do in mine hou see she hath

judah which they have done against themselv to provok me to anger 
in offer incen unto baal 

11 18 and the lord hath given me knowledg of it and i know it then

and i knew not that they had devi devic against me say let

11 20 but o lord of host that judgest righteou that triest the 
rein and the heart let me see thi vengeanc on them for unto thee 
have i reveal my cau 

11 21 therefor thu saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek 
thi life say prophesi not in the name of the lord that thou die 
not by our hand 11 22 therefor thu saith the lord of host behold 
i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their son 
and their daughter shall die by famin 11 23 and there shall be no 
remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even

prosper wherefor are all they happi that deal veri treacher 
12 2 thou hast plant them yea they have taken root they grow

speak fair word unto thee 

12 7 i have forsaken mine hou i have left mine heritag i have

of judah from among them 

12 15 and it shall come to pa after that i have pluck them out i

cau to cleav unto me the whole hou of israel and the whole hou 
of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a peopl and 
for a name and for a prai and for a glori but they would not

13 12 therefor thou shalt speak unto them thi word thu saith the 
lord god of israel everi bottl shall be fill with wine and they 
shall say unto thee do we not certainli know that everi bottl shall

lord is

day neither do ye ani work but hallow ye the sabbath day a i 
command your father

and not to bear a burden even enter in at the gate of jerusalem 
on the sabbath day then will i kindl a fire in the gate thereof 
and it shall devour the palac of jerusalem and it shall not be 
quench 

18 1 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord say 18 2 
ari and go down to the potter s hou and there i will cau thee 
to hear my word 

18 3 then i went down to the potter s hou and behold he wrought a 
work on the wheel 

18 4 and the vessel that he made of clay wa mar in the hand of the 
potter so he made it again anoth vessel a seem good to the 
potter to make it 

18 5 then the word of the lord came to me say 18 6 o hou of 
israel cannot i do with you a thi potter saith the lord behold 
a the clay is in the potter s hand so are ye in mine hand o hou 
of israel 

18 7 at what instant i shall speak concern a nation and concern 
a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it 18 8 if 
that nation against whom i have pronounc turn from their evil i 
will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them 

18 9 and at what instant i shall speak concern a nation and 
concern a kingdom to build and to plant it 18 10 if it do evil in 
my sight that it obey not my voic then i will repent of the good 
wherewith i said i would benefit them 

18 11 now therefor go to speak to the men of judah and to the 
inhabit of jerusalem say thu saith the lord behold i frame 
evil against you and devi a devic against you return ye now everi 
one from hi evil way and make your way and your do good 

18 12 and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own 
devic and we will everi one do the imagin of hi evil heart 

18 13 therefor thu saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who 
hath heard such thing the virgin of israel hath done a veri horribl 
thing 

18 14 will a man leav the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock 
of the field or shall the cold flow water that come from anoth 
place be forsaken 18 15 becau my peopl hath forgotten me they 
have burn incen to vaniti and they have cau them to stumbl in 
their way from the ancient path to walk in path in a way not cast 
up 18 16 to make their land desol and a perpetu hiss everi 
one that passeth therebi shall be astonish and wag hi head 

18 17 i will scatter them a with an east wind befor the enemi i 
will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their 
calam 

18 18 then said they come and let u devi devic against jeremiah 
for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the 
wise nor the word from the prophet come and let u smite him with 
the tongu and let u not give heed to ani of hi word 

18 19 give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voic of them that 
contend with me 

18 20 shall evil be recompen for good for they have dig a pit 
for my soul rememb that i stood befor thee to speak good for them 
and to turn away thi wrath from them 

18 21 therefor deliv up their child to the famin and pour out 
their blood by the forc of the sword and let their wife be bereav 
of their child and be widow and let their men be put to death 
let their young men be slain by the sword in battl 

18 22 let a cri be heard from their hou when thou shalt bring a 
troop suddenli upon them for they have dig a pit to take me and 
hid snare for my foot 

18 23 yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me 
forgiv not their iniqu neither blot out their sin from thi sight 
but let them be overthrown befor thee deal thu with them in the 
time of thine anger 

19 1 thu saith the lord go and get a potter s earthen bottl and 
take of the ancient of the peopl and of the ancient of the 
priest 19 2 and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which 
is by the entri of the east gate and proclaim there the word that i 
shall tell thee 19 3 and say hear ye the word of the lord o king 
of judah and inhabit of jerusalem thu saith the lord of host 
the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon thi place the 
which whosoev heareth hi ear shall tingl 

19 4 becau they have forsaken me and have estrang thi place and 
have burn incen in it unto other god whom neither they nor their 
father have known nor the king of judah and have fill thi place 
with the blood of innoc 19 5 they have built also the high place 
of baal to burn their son with fire for burnt offer unto baal 
which i command not nor spake it neither came it into my mind 
19 6 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that thi place 
shall no more be call tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom 
but the valley of slaughter 

19 7 and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in thi 
place and i will cau them to fall by the sword befor their 
enemi and by the hand of them that seek their life and their 
carca will i give to be meat for the fowl of the heaven and for 
the beast of the earth 

19 8 and i will make thi citi desol and an hiss everi one 
that passeth therebi shall be astonish and hiss becau of all the 
plagu thereof 

19 9 and i will cau them to eat the flesh of their son and the 
flesh of their daughter and they shall eat everi one the flesh of 
hi friend in the sieg and strait wherewith their enemi and 
they that seek their life shall straiten them 

19 10 then shalt thou break the bottl in the sight of the men that go 
with thee 19 11 and shalt say unto them thu saith the lord of 
host even so will i break thi peopl and thi citi a one breaketh 
a potter s vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall 
buri them in tophet till there be no place to buri 

19 12 thu will i do unto thi place saith the lord and to the 
inhabit thereof and even make thi citi a tophet 19 13 and the 
hou of jerusalem and the hou of the king of judah shall be 
defil a the place of tophet becau of all the hou upon whose 
roof they have burn incen unto all the host of heaven and have 
pour out drink offer unto other god 

19 14 then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to 
prophesi and he stood in the court of the lord s hou and said to 
all the peopl 19 15 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel 
behold i will bring upon thi citi and upon all her town all the 
evil that i have pronounc against it becau they have harden 
their neck that they might not hear my word 

20 1 now pashur the son of immer the priest who wa also chief 
governor in the hou of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesi 
these thing 

20 2 then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stock 
that were in the high gate of benjamin which wa by the hou of the 
lord 

20 3 and it came to pa on the morrow that pashur brought forth 
jeremiah out of the stock then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath 
not call thi name pashur but magormissabib 

20 4 for thu saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to 
thyself and to all thi friend and they shall fall by the sword of 
their enemi and thine eye shall behold it and i will give all 
judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carri them 
captiv into babylon and shall slay them with the sword 

20 5 moreov i will deliv all the strength of thi citi and all 
the labour thereof and all the preciou thing thereof and all the 
treasur of the king of judah will i give into the hand of their 
enemi which shall spoil them and take them and carri them to 
babylon 

20 6 and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine hou shall go into 
captiv and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die 
and shalt be buri there thou and all thi friend to whom thou 
hast prophesi lie 

20 7 o lord thou hast deceiv me and i wa deceiv thou art 
stronger than i and hast prevail i am in deri daili everi one 
mocketh me 

20 8 for sinc i spake i cri out i cri violenc and spoil 
becau the word of the lord wa made a reproach unto me and a 
deri daili 

20 9 then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak ani more 
in hi name but hi word wa in mine heart a a burn fire shut up 
in my bone and i wa weari with forbear and i could not stay 

20 10 for i heard the defam of mani fear on everi side report 
say they and we will report it all my familiar watch for my 
halt say peradventur he will be entic and we shall prevail 
against him and we shall take our reveng on him 

20 11 but the lord is with me a a mighti terribl one therefor my 
persecutor shall stumbl and they shall not prevail they shall be 
greatli asham for they shall not prosper their everlast 
confu shall never be forgotten 

20 12 but o lord of host that triest the righteou and seest the 
rein and the heart let me see thi vengeanc on them for unto thee 
have i open my cau 

20 13 sing unto the lord prai ye the lord for he hath deliv 
the soul of the poor from the hand of evildo 

20 14 cur be the day wherein i wa born let not the day wherein my 
mother bare me be bless 

20 15 cur be the man who brought tide to my father say a 
man child is born unto thee make him veri glad 

20 16 and let that man be a the citi which the lord overthrew and 
repent not and let him hear the cri in the morn and the 
shout at noontid 20 17 becau he slew me not from the womb or 
that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be alway 
great with me 

20 18 wherefor came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow 
that my day should be consum with shame 21 1 the word which came 
unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur 
the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest 
say 21 2 enquir i pray thee of the lord for u for 
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against u if so be that 
the lord will deal with u accord to all hi wondrou work that 
he may go up from u 

21 3 then said jeremiah unto them thu shall ye say to zedekiah 21 4 
thu saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the 
weapon of war that are in your hand wherewith ye fight against the 
king of babylon and against the chaldean which besieg you without 
the wall and i will assembl them into the midst of thi citi 

21 5 and i myself will fight against you with an outstretch hand and 
with a strong arm even in anger and in furi and in great wrath 

21 6 and i will smite the inhabit of thi citi both man and 
beast they shall die of a great pestil 

21 7 and afterward saith the lord i will deliv zedekiah king of 
judah and hi servant and the peopl and such a are left in thi 
citi from the pestil from the sword and from the famin into 
the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their 
enemi and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall 
smite them with the edg of the sword he shall not spare them 
neither have piti nor have merci 

21 8 and unto thi peopl thou shalt say thu saith the lord behold 
i set befor you the way of life and the way of death 

21 9 he that abideth in thi citi shall die by the sword and by the 
famin and by the pestil but he that goeth out and falleth to 
the chaldean that besieg you he shall live and hi life shall be 
unto him for a prey 

21 10 for i have set my face against thi citi for evil and not for 
good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of 
babylon and he shall burn it with fire 

21 11 and touch the hou of the king of judah say hear ye the 
word of the lord 21 12 o hou of david thu saith the lord execut 
judgment in the morn and deliv him that is spoil out of the 
hand of the oppressor lest my furi go out like fire and burn that

21 13 behold i am against thee o inhabit of the valley and rock 
of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against 
u or who shall enter into our habit 21 14 but i will punish

22 1 thu saith the lord go down to the hou of the king of judah 
and speak there thi word 22 2 and say hear the word of the lord o 
king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thi 
servant and thi peopl that enter in by these gate 22 3 thu saith 
the lord execut ye judgment and righteou and deliv the

gate of thi hou king sit upon the throne of david ride in 
chariot and on hor he and hi servant and hi peopl 

22 5 but if ye will not hear these word i swear by myself saith the 
lord that thi hou shall becom a desol 

22 6 for thu saith the lord unto the king s hou of judah thou art 
gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet sure i will make thee a 
wilder and citi which are not inhabit 

22 7 and i will prepar destroy against thee everi one with hi 
weapon and they shall cut down thi choic cedar and cast them into 
the fire 

22 8 and mani nation shall pa by thi citi and they shall say 
everi man to hi neighbour wherefor hath the lord done thu unto 
thi great citi 22 9 then they shall answer becau they have 
forsaken the coven of the lord their god and worship other 
god and serv them 

22 10 weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for 
him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see hi nativ 
countri 

22 11 for thu saith the lord touch shallum the son of josiah king 
of judah which reign instead of josiah hi father which went forth 
out of thi place he shall not return thither ani more 22 12 but he 
shall die in the place whither they have led him captiv and shall 
see thi land no more 

22 13 woe unto him that buildeth hi hou by unright and hi 
chamber by wrong that useth hi neighbour s servic without wage 
and giveth him not for hi work 22 14 that saith i will build me a 
wide hou and larg chamber and cutteth him out window and it is 
ciel with cedar and paint with vermilion 

22 15 shalt thou reign becau thou closest thyself in cedar did not 
thi father eat and drink and do judgment and justic and then it wa 
well with him 22 16 he judg the cau of the poor and needi then 
it wa well with him wa not thi to know me saith the lord 

22 17 but thine eye and thine heart are not but for thi covet 
and for to shed innoc blood and for oppress and for violenc

them that seek thi life and into the hand of them whose face thou 
fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and 
into the hand of the chaldean 

22 26 and i will cast thee out and thi mother that bare thee into 
anoth countri where ye were not born and there shall ye die 

22 27 but to the land whereunto they desir to return thither shall 
they not return

wherein is no pleasur wherefor are they cast out he and hi seed 
and are cast into a land which they know not 22 29 o earth earth 
earth hear the word of the lord 

22 30 thu saith the lord write ye thi man childless a man that

sit upon the throne of david and rule ani more in judah 

23 1 woe be unto the pastor that destroy and scatter the sheep of my 
pastur saith the lord 

23 2 therefor thu saith the lord god of israel against the pastor 
that feed my peopl ye have scatter my flock and driven them away 
and have not visit them behold i will visit upon you the evil of 
your do saith the lord 

23 3 and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countri 
whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their fold 
and they shall be fruit and increa 

23 4 and i will set up shepherd over them which shall feed them and 
they shall fear no more nor be dismay neither shall they be 
lack saith the lord 

23 5 behold the day come saith the lord that i will rai unto

shall execut judgment and justic in the earth 

23 6 in hi day judah shall be save and israel shall dwell safe 
and thi is hi name wherebi he shall be call the lord our 
righteou 

23 7 therefor behold the day come saith the lord that they shall 
no more say the lord liveth which brought up the child of israel 
out of the land of egypt 23 8 but the lord liveth which brought up 
and which led the seed of the hou of israel out of the north 
countri and from all countri whither i had driven them and they 
shall dwell in their own land 

23 9 mine heart within me is broken becau of the prophet all my 
bone shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath 
overcom becau of the lord and becau of the word of hi 
holi 

23 10 for the land is full of adult for becau of swear the 
land mourneth the pleasant place of the wilder are dri up and 
their cour is evil and their forc is not right 

23 11 for both prophet and priest are profan yea in my hou have i 
found their wick saith the lord 

23 12 wherefor their way shall be unto them a slipperi way in the 
dark they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring 
evil upon them even the year of their visit saith the lord 

23 13 and i have seen folli in the prophet of samaria they 
prophesi in baal and cau my peopl israel to err 

23 14 i have seen also in the prophet of jerusalem an horribl thing 
they commit adulteri and walk in lie they strengthen also the hand 
of evildo that none doth return from hi wick they are all 
of them unto me a sodom and the inhabit thereof a gomorrah 

23 15 therefor thu saith the lord of host concern the prophet 
behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water 
of gall for from the prophet of jerusalem is profan gone forth 
into all the land 

23 16 thu saith the lord of host hearken not unto the word of the 
prophet that prophesi unto you they make you vain they speak a 
vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord 

23 17 they say still unto them that despi me the lord hath said ye 
shall have peac and they say unto everi one that walketh after the 
imagin of hi own heart no evil shall come upon you 

23 18 for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath 
perceiv and heard hi word who hath mark hi word and heard it 
23 19 behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in furi even a 
grievou whirlwind it shall fall grievou upon the head of the 
wick 

23 20 the anger of the lord shall not return until he have execut 
and till he have perform the thought of hi heart in the latter 
day ye shall consid it perfectli 

23 21 i have not sent these prophet yet they ran i have not spoken 
to them yet they prophesi 

23 22 but if they had stood in my counsel and had cau my peopl to 
hear my word then they should have turn them from their evil way 
and from the evil of their do 

23 23 am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off 
23 24 can ani hide himself in secret place that i shall not see him 
saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord 

23 25 i have heard what the prophet said that prophesi lie in my 
name say i have dream i have dream 

23 26 how long shall thi be in the heart of the prophet that 
prophesi lie yea they are prophet of the deceit of their own 
heart 23 27 which think to cau my peopl to forget my name by their 
dream which they tell everi man to hi neighbour a their father 
have forgotten my name for baal 

23 28 the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that 
hath my word let him speak my word faith what is the chaff to 
the wheat saith the lord 

23 29 is not my word like a a fire saith the lord and like a hammer 
that breaketh the rock in piec 23 30 therefor behold i am 
against the prophet saith the lord that steal my word everi one 
from hi neighbour 

23 31 behold i am against the prophet saith the lord that use 
their tongu and say he saith 

23 32 behold i am against them that prophesi fal dream saith the 
lord and do tell them and cau my peopl to err by their lie and 
by their light yet i sent them not nor command them therefor 
they shall not profit thi peopl at all saith the lord 

23 33 and when thi peopl or the prophet or a priest shall ask 
thee say what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto 
them what burden i will even forsak you saith the lord 

23 34 and a for the prophet and the priest and the peopl that 
shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and hi 
hou 

23 35 thu shall ye say everi one to hi neighbour and everi one to 
hi brother what hath the lord answer and what hath the lord 
spoken 23 36 and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more 
for everi man s word shall be hi burden for ye have pervert the 
word of the live god of the lord of host our god 

23 37 thu shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answer 
thee and what hath the lord spoken 23 38 but sinc ye say the 
burden of the lord therefor thu saith the lord becau ye say thi 
word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you say ye 
shall not say the burden of the lord 23 39 therefor behold i 
even i will utterli forget you and i will forsak you and the citi 
that i gave you and your father and cast you out of my presenc 
23 40 and i will bring an everlast reproach upon you and a 
perpetu shame which shall not be forgotten 

24 1 the lord shew me and behold two basket of fig were set 
befor the templ of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of 
babylon had carri away captiv jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of 
judah and the princ of judah with the carpent and smith from 
jerusalem and had brought them to babylon 

24 2 one basket had veri good fig even like the fig that are first 
ripe and the other basket had veri naughti fig which could not be 
eaten they were so bad 

24 3 then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i 
said fig the good fig veri good and the evil veri evil that 
cannot be eaten they are so evil 

24 4 again the word of the lord came unto me say 24 5 thu saith 
the lord the god of israel like these good fig so will i 
acknowledg them that are carri away captiv of judah whom i have 
sent out of thi place into the land of the chaldean for their good 

24 6 for i will set mine eye upon them for good and i will bring 
them again to thi land and i will build them and not pull them 
down and i will plant them and not pluck them up 

24 7 and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and 
they shall be my peopl and i will be their god for they shall 
return unto me with their whole heart 

24 8 and a the evil fig which cannot be eaten they are so evil 
sure thu saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah 
and hi princ and the residu of jerusalem that remain in thi 
land and them that dwell in the land of egypt 24 9 and i will 
deliv them to be remov into all the kingdom of the earth for 
their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a cur in 
all place whither i shall drive them 

24 10 and i will send the sword the famin and the pestil among 
them till they be consum from off the land that i gave unto them 
and to their father 

25 1 the word that came to jeremiah concern all the peopl of judah 
in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that 
wa the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon 25 2 the which 
jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the peopl of judah and to all 
the inhabit of jerusalem say 25 3 from the thirteenth year of 
josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto thi day that is the 
three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and 
i have spoken unto you rise earli and speak but ye have not 
hearken 

25 4 and the lord hath sent unto you all hi servant the prophet 
rise earli and send them but ye have not hearken nor inclin 
your ear to hear 

25 5 they said turn ye again now everi one from hi evil way and 
from the evil of your do and dwell in the land that the lord hath 
given unto you and to your father for ever and ever 25 6 and go not 
after other god to serv them and to worship them and provok me 
not to anger with the work of your hand and i will do you no hurt 

25 7 yet ye have not hearken unto me saith the lord that ye might 
provok me to anger with the work of your hand to your own hurt 

25 8 therefor thu saith the lord of host becau ye have not heard 
my word 25 9 behold i will send and take all the famili of the 
north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my 
servant and will bring them against thi land and against the

hiss and perpetu desol 

25 10 moreov i will take from them the voic of mirth and the voic 
of glad the voic of the bridegroom and the voic of the bride 
the sound of the millston and the light of the candl 

25 11 and thi whole land shall be a desol and an astonish 
and these nation shall serv the king of babylon seventi year 

25 12 and it shall come to pa when seventi year are accomplish 
that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the 
lord for their iniqu and the land of the chaldean and will make 
it perpetu desol 

25 13 and i will bring upon that land all my word which i have 
pronounc against it even all that is written in thi book which 
jeremiah hath prophesi against all the nation 

25 14 for mani nation and great king shall serv themselv of them 
also and i will recompen them accord to their deed and 
accord to the work of their own hand 

25 15 for thu saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup 
of thi furi at my hand and cau all the nation to whom i send 
thee to drink it 

25 16 and they shall drink and be move and be mad becau of the 
sword that i will send among them 

25 17 then took i the cup at the lord s hand and made all the nation

26 1 in the begin of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king 
of judah came thi word from the lord say 26 2 thu saith the 
lord stand in the court of the lord s hou and speak unto all the 
citi of judah which come to worship in the lord s hou all the

that i may repent me of the evil which i purpo to do unto them 
becau of the evil of their do 

26 4 and thou shalt say unto them thu saith the lord if ye will not

hearken to the word of my servant the prophet whom i sent unto 
you both rise up earli and send them but ye have not 
hearken 26 6 then will i make thi hou like shiloh and will make 
thi citi a cur to all the nation of the earth 

26 7 so the priest and the prophet and all the peopl heard jeremiah 
speak these word in the hou of the lord 

26 8 now it came to pa when jeremiah had made an end of speak 
all that the lord had command him to speak unto all the peopl that 
the priest and the prophet and all the peopl took him say thou 
shalt sure die 

26 9 whi hast thou prophesi in the name of the lord say thi 
hou shall be like shiloh and thi citi shall be desol without an 
inhabit and all the peopl were gather against jeremiah in the 
hou of the lord 

26 10 when the princ of judah heard these thing then they came up 
from the king s hou unto the hou of the lord and sat down in the 
entri of the new gate of the lord s hou 

26 11 then spake the priest and the prophet unto the princ and to 
all the peopl say thi man is worthi to die for he hath 
prophesi against thi citi a ye have heard with your ear 

26 12 then spake jeremiah unto all the princ and to all the peopl 
say the lord sent me to prophesi against thi hou and against 
thi citi all the word that ye have heard 

26 13 therefor now amend your way and your do and obey the 
voic of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil 
that he hath pronounc against you 

26 14 a for me behold i am in your hand do with me a seemeth good 
and meet unto you 

26 15 but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall 
sure bring innoc blood upon yourselv and upon thi citi and 
upon the inhabit thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me 
unto you to speak all these word in your ear 

26 16 then said the princ and all the peopl unto the priest and to 
the prophet thi man is not worthi to die for he hath spoken to u 
in the name of the lord our god 

26 17 then rose up certain of the elder of the land and spake to all 
the assembl of the peopl say 26 18 micah the morasthit 
prophesi in the day of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the 
peopl of judah say thu saith the lord of host zion shall be 
plow like a field and jerusalem shall becom heap and the 
mountain of the hou a the high place of a forest 

26 19 did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to 
death did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord 
repent him of the evil which he had pronounc against them thu 
might we procur great evil against our soul 

26 20 and there wa also a man that prophesi in the name of the 
lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesi 
against thi citi and against thi land accord to all the word of 
jeremiah 

26 21 and when jehoiakim the king with all hi mighti men and all 
the princ heard hi word the king sought to put him to death but 
when urijah heard it he wa afraid and fled and went into egypt 
26 22 and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt name elnathan the 
son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt 

26 23 and they fetch forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto 
jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast hi dead 
bodi into the graf of the common peopl 

26 24 nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan wa with 
jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the peopl to 
put him to death 

27 1 in the begin of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king 
of judah came thi word unto jeremiah from the lord say 27 2 thu 
saith the lord to me make thee bond and yoke and put them upon thi 
neck 27 3 and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab 
and to the king of the ammonit and to the king of tyru and to the 
king of zidon by the hand of the messeng which come to jerusalem 
unto zedekiah king of judah 27 4 and command them to say unto their 
master thu saith the lord of host the god of israel thu shall 
ye say unto your master 27 5 i have made the earth the man and the 
beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my 
outstretch arm and have given it unto whom it seem meet unto me 

27 6 and now have i given all these land into the hand of 
nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beast of the 
field have i given him also to serv him 

27 7 and all nation shall serv him and hi son and hi son s son 
until the veri time of hi land come and then mani nation and great 
king shall serv themselv of him 

27 8 and it shall come to pa that the nation and kingdom which will 
not serv the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will 
not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation 
will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famin 
and with the pestil until i have consum them by hi hand 

27 9 therefor hearken not ye to your prophet nor to your divin 
nor to your dreamer nor to your enchant nor to your sorcer 
which speak unto you say ye shall not serv the king of babylon 
27 10 for they prophesi a lie unto you to remov you far from your 
land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish 

27 11 but the nation that bring their neck under the yoke of the king 
of babylon and serv him those will i let remain still in their own 
land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein 

27 12 i spake also to zedekiah king of judah accord to all these 
word say bring your neck under the yoke of the king of babylon 
and serv him and hi peopl and live 

27 13 whi will ye die thou and thi peopl by the sword by the 
famin and by the pestil a the lord hath spoken against the 
nation that will not serv the king of babylon 27 14 therefor 
hearken not unto the word of the prophet that speak unto you 
say ye shall not serv the king of babylon for they prophesi a 
lie unto you 

27 15 for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesi a 
lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish 
ye and the prophet that prophesi unto you 

27 16 also i spake to the priest and to all thi peopl say thu 
saith the lord hearken not to the word of your prophet that 
prophesi unto you say behold the vessel of the lord s hou 
shall now shortli be brought again from babylon for they prophesi a 
lie unto you 

27 17 hearken not unto them serv the king of babylon and live 
wherefor should thi citi be laid wast 27 18 but if they be 
prophet and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make 
intercess to the lord of host that the vessel which are left in 
the hou of the lord and in the hou of the king of judah and at 
jerusalem go not to babylon 

27 19 for thu saith the lord of host concern the pillar and 
concern the sea and concern the base and concern the 
residu of the vessel that remain in thi citi 

27 20 which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carri 
away captiv jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from 
jerusalem to babylon and all the nobl of judah and jerusalem 27 21 
yea thu saith the lord of host the god of israel concern the 
vessel that remain in the hou of the lord and in the hou of the 
king of judah and of jerusalem 27 22 they shall be carri to 
babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them 
saith the lord then will i bring them up and restor them to thi 
place 

28 1 and it came to pa the same year in the begin of the reign 
of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month 
that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which wa of gibeon spake 
unto me in the hou of the lord in the presenc of the priest and 
of all the peopl say 28 2 thu speaketh the lord of host the 
god of israel say i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon 

28 3 within two full year will i bring again into thi place all the 
vessel of the lord s hou that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took 
away from thi place and carri them to babylon 28 4 and i will 
bring again to thi place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah 
with all the captiv of judah that went into babylon saith the 
lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon 

28 5 then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the 
presenc of the priest and in the presenc of all the peopl that 
stood in the hou of the lord 28 6 even the prophet jeremiah said 
amen the lord do so the lord perform thi word which thou hast 
prophesi to bring again the vessel of the lord s hou and all 
that is carri away captiv from babylon into thi place 

28 7 nevertheless hear thou now thi word that i speak in thine ear 
and in the ear of all the peopl 28 8 the prophet that have been 
befor me and befor thee of old prophesi both against mani 
countri and against great kingdom of war and of evil and of 
pestil 

28 9 the prophet which prophesieth of peac when the word of the 
prophet shall come to pa then shall the prophet be known that the 
lord hath truli sent him 

28 10 then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet 
jeremiah s neck and brake it 

28 11 and hananiah spake in the presenc of all the peopl say 
thu saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar 
king of babylon from the neck of all nation within the space of two 
full year and the prophet jeremiah went hi way 

28 12 then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after 
that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the 
prophet jeremiah say 28 13 go and tell hananiah say thu 
saith the lord thou hast broken the yoke of wood but thou shalt 
make for them yoke of iron 

28 14 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel i have put 
a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nation that they may serv 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serv him and i have 
given him the beast of the field also 

28 15 then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear 
now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest thi 
peopl to trust in a lie 

28 16 therefor thu saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off 
the face of the earth thi year thou shalt die becau thou hast 
taught rebellion against the lord 

28 17 so hananiah the prophet die the same year in the seventh month 

29 1 now these are the word of the letter that jeremiah the prophet 
sent from jerusalem unto the residu of the elder which were carri 
away captiv and to the priest and to the prophet and to all the 
peopl whom nebuchadnezzar had carri away captiv from jerusalem to 
babylon 29 2 after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the 
eunuch the princ of judah and jerusalem and the carpent and 
the smith were depart from jerusalem 29 3 by the hand of elasah 
the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah 
king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon 
say 29 4 thu saith the lord of host the god of israel unto all

daughter to husband that they may bear son and daughter that ye

29 7 and seek the peac of the citi whither i have cau you to be 
carri away captiv and pray unto the lord for it for in the peac 
thereof shall ye have peac

neither hearken to your dream which ye cau to be dream 

29 9 for they prophesi fal unto you in my name i have not sent

upon them the sword the famin and the pestil and will make 
them like vile fig that cannot be eaten they are so evil 

29 18 and i will persecut them with the sword with the famin and 
with the pestil and will deliv them to be remov to all the 
kingdom of the earth to be a cur and an astonish and an 
hiss and a reproach among all the nation whither i have driven

earli and send them but ye would not hear saith the lord 

29 20 hear ye therefor the word of the lord all ye of the captiv

of host the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of 
zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesi a lie unto you in my 
name behold i will deliv them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king 
of babylon and he shall slay them befor your eye 29 22 and of them 
shall be taken up a cur by all the captiv of judah which are in 
babylon say the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom 
the king of babylon roast in the fire 29 23 becau they have 
commit villani in israel and have commit adulteri with their 
neighbour wife and have spoken lie word in my name which i 
have not command them even i know and am a wit saith the 
lord 

29 24 thu shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamit say 
29 25 thu speaketh the lord of host the god of israel say 
becau thou hast sent letter in thi name unto all the peopl that 
are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and

the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be offic in the 
hou of the lord for everi man that is mad and maketh himself a 
prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stock 

29 27 now therefor whi hast thou not reprov jeremiah of anathoth 
which maketh himself a prophet to you 29 28 for therefor he sent 
unto u in babylon say thi captiv is long build ye hou 
and dwell in them and plant garden and eat the fruit of them 

29 29 and zephaniah the priest read thi letter in the ear of 
jeremiah the prophet

that i will break hi yoke from off thi neck and will burst thi 
bond and stranger shall no more serv themselv of him 30 9 but 
they shall serv the lord their god and david their king whom i will

30 10 therefor fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord 
neither be dismay o israel for lo i will save thee from afar 
and thi seed from the land of their captiv and jacob shall return

32 4 and zedekiah king of judah shall not escap out of the hand of

of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and hi eye 
shall behold hi eye 32 5 and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and 
there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fight 
with the chaldean ye shall not prosper 

32 6 and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me say 
32 7 behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncl shall come unto 
thee say buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of 
redempt is thine to buy it

prison accord to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my 
field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the countri of 
benjamin for the right of inherit is thine and the redempt is

then i knew that thi wa the word of the lord

32 10 and i subscrib the evid and seal it and took

out arm and with great terror 32 22 and hast given them thi land 
which thou didst swear to their father to give them a land flow 
with milk and honey 32 23 and they came in and poss it but 
they obey not thi voic neither walk in thi law they have done 
noth of all that thou commandedst them to do therefor thou hast

chaldean that fight against thi citi shall come and set fire on 
thi citi and burn it with the hou upon whose roof they have 
offer incen unto baal and pour out drink offer unto other 
god to provok me to anger 

32 30 for the child of israel and the child of judah have onli 
done evil befor me from their youth for the child of israel have 
onli provok me to anger with the work of their hand saith the 
lord 

32 31 for thi citi hath been to me a a provoc of mine anger and

32 35 and they built the high place of baal which are in the valley 
of the son of hinnom to cau their son and their daughter to pa

they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their child 
after them 32 40 and i will make an everlast coven with them 
that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put 
my fear in their heart that they shall not depart from me

place about jerusalem and in the citi of judah and in the citi 
of the mountain and in the citi of the valley and in the citi

of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my furi and for all 
whose wick i have hid my face from thi citi 

33 6 behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them 
and will reveal unto them the abund of peac and truth 

33 7 and i will cau the captiv of judah and the captiv of 
israel to return and will build them a at the first 

33 8 and i will clean them from all their iniqu wherebi they 
have sin against me and i will pardon all their iniqu 
wherebi they have sin and wherebi they have transgress against

33 9 and it shall be to me a name of joy a prai and an honour 
befor all the nation of the earth which shall hear all the good 
that i do unto them and they shall fear and trembl for all the 
good and for all the prosper that i procur unto it 

33 10 thu saith the lord again there shall be heard in thi place 
which ye say shall be desol without man and without beast even in

place about jerusalem and in the citi of judah shall the flock 
pa again under the hand of him that telleth them saith the lord 

33 14 behold the day come saith the lord that i will perform that 
good thing which i have promi unto the hou of israel and to the 
hou of judah 

33 15 in those day and at that time will i cau the branch of

righteou in the land 

33 16 in those day shall judah be save and jerusalem shall dwell 
safe and thi is the name wherewith she shall be call the lord 
our righteou 

33 17 for thu saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit 
upon the throne of the hou of israel 33 18 neither shall the 
priest the levit want a man befor me to offer burnt offer and 
to kindl meat offer and to do sacrif continu 

33 19 and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah say 33 20 thu 
saith the lord if ye can break my coven of the day and my 
coven of the night and that there should not be day and night in 
their season 33 21 then may also my coven be broken with david my 
servant that he should not have a son to reign upon hi throne and 
with the levit the priest my minist 

33 22 a the host of heaven cannot be number neither the sand of 
the sea measur so will i multipli the seed of david my servant and 
the levit that minist unto me 

33 23 moreov the word of the lord came to jeremiah say 33 24 
considerest thou not what thi peopl have spoken say the two 
famili which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thu 
they have despi my peopl that they should be no more a nation 
befor them 

33 25 thu saith the lord if my coven be not with day and night 
and if i have not appoint the ordin of heaven and earth 33 26 
then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that 
i will not take ani of hi seed to be ruler over the seed of abraham 
isaac and jacob for i will cau their captiv to return and have 
merci on them 

34 1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when 
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all hi armi and all the kingdom 
of the earth of hi dominion and all the peopl fought against 
jerusalem and against all the citi thereof say 34 2 thu saith 
the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah 
and tell him thu saith the lord behold i will give thi citi into 
the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire 34 3 
and thou shalt not escap out of hi hand but shalt sure be taken 
and deliv into hi hand and thine eye shall behold the eye of 
the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and 
thou shalt go to babylon 

34 4 yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thu 
saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword 34 5 but thou 
shalt die in peac and with the burn of thi father the former 
king which were befor thee so shall they burn odour for thee and 
they will lament thee say ah lord for i have pronounc the 
word saith the lord 

34 6 then jeremiah the prophet spake all these word unto zedekiah 
king of judah in jerusalem 34 7 when the king of babylon s armi 
fought against jerusalem and against all the citi of judah that 
were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenc 
citi remain of the citi of judah 

34 8 thi is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after 
that the king zedekiah had made a coven with all the peopl which 
were at jerusalem to proclaim liberti unto them 34 9 that everi man 
should let hi manserv and everi man hi maidserv be an 
hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serv himself of 
them to wit of a jew hi brother 

34 10 now when all the princ and all the peopl which had enter 
into the coven heard that everi one should let hi manserv and 
everi one hi maidserv go free that none should serv themselv 
of them ani more then they obey and let them go 

34 11 but afterward they turn and cau the servant and the 
handmaid whom they had let go free to return and brought them into 
subject for servant and for handmaid 

34 12 therefor the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord 
say 34 13 thu saith the lord the god of israel i made a 
coven with your father in the day that i brought them forth out of 
the land of egypt out of the hou of bondman say 34 14 at the 
end of seven year let ye go everi man hi brother an hebrew which 
hath been sold unto thee and when he hath serv thee six year thou 
shalt let him go free from thee but your father hearken not unto 
me neither inclin their ear 

34 15 and ye were now turn and had done right in my sight in 
proclaim liberti everi man to hi neighbour and ye had made a 
coven befor me in the hou which is call by my name 34 16 but 
ye turn and pollut my name and cau everi man hi servant and 
everi man hi handmaid whom ye had set at liberti at their pleasur 
to return and brought them into subject to be unto you for 
servant and for handmaid 

34 17 therefor thu saith the lord ye have not hearken unto me in 
proclaim liberti everi one to hi brother and everi man to hi 
neighbour behold i proclaim a liberti for you saith the lord to 
the sword to the pestil and to the famin and i will make you 
to be remov into all the kingdom of the earth 

34 18 and i will give the men that have transgress my coven 
which have not perform the word of the coven which they had made 
befor me when they cut the calf in twain and pa between the 
part thereof 34 19 the princ of judah and the princ of 
jerusalem the eunuch and the priest and all the peopl of the 
land which pa between the part of the calf 34 20 i will even 
give them into the hand of their enemi and into the hand of them 
that seek their life and their dead bodi shall be for meat unto the 
fowl of the heaven and to the beast of the earth 

34 21 and zedekiah king of judah and hi princ will i give into the 
hand of their enemi and into the hand of them that seek their life 
and into the hand of the king of babylon s armi which are gone up 
from you 

34 22 behold i will command saith the lord and cau them to return 
to thi citi and they shall fight against it and take it and burn 
it with fire and i will make the citi of judah a desol without 
an inhabit 

35 1 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the day of 
jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah say 35 2 go unto the 
hou of the rechabit and speak unto them and bring them into the 
hou of the lord into one of the chamber and give them wine to 
drink 

35 3 then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah 
and hi brother and all hi son and the whole hou of the 
rechabit 35 4 and i brought them into the hou of the lord into 
the chamber of the son of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god 
which wa by the chamber of the princ which wa abov the chamber 
of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door 35 5 and i set 
befor the son of the hou of the rechabit pot full of wine and 
cup and i said unto them drink ye wine 

35 6 but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of 
rechab our father command u say ye shall drink no wine 
neither ye nor your son for ever 35 7 neither shall ye build hou 
nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have ani but all your day ye 
shall dwell in tent that ye may live mani day in the land where ye 
be stranger 

35 8 thu have we obey the voic of jonadab the son of rechab our 
father in all that he hath charg u to drink no wine all our day 
we our wife our son nor our daughter 35 9 nor to build hou 
for u to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed 
35 10 but we have dwelt in tent and have obey and done accord 
to all that jonadab our father command u 

35 11 but it came to pa when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up 
into the land that we said come and let u go to jerusalem for fear 
of the armi of the chaldean and for fear of the armi of the syrian 
so we dwell at jerusalem 

35 12 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah say 35 13 thu 
saith the lord of host the god of israel go and tell the men of 
judah and the inhabit of jerusalem will ye not receiv 
instruct to hearken to my word saith the lord 

35 14 the word of jonadab the son of rechab that he command hi

evil way and amend your do and go not after other god to serv 
them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to

me 

35 16 becau the son of jonadab the son of rechab have perform the 
command of their father which he command them but thi peopl 
hath not hearken unto me 35 17 therefor thu saith the lord god of 
host the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all 
the inhabit of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounc 
against them becau i have spoken unto them but they have not 
heard and i have call unto them but they have not answer 

35 18 and jeremiah said unto the hou of the rechabit thu saith 
the lord of host the god of israel becau ye have obey the 
command of jonadab your father and kept all hi precept and 
done accord unto all that he hath command you 35 19 therefor 
thu saith the lord of host the god of israel jonadab the son of 
rechab shall not want a man to stand befor me for ever 

36 1 and it came to pa in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of 
josiah king of judah that thi word came unto jeremiah from the lord 
say 36 2 take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the 
word that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah 
and against all the nation from the day i spake unto thee from the 
day of josiah even unto thi day 

36 3 it may be that the hou of judah will hear all the evil which i 
purpo to do unto them that they may return everi man from hi evil 
way that i may forgiv their iniqu and their sin 

36 4 then jeremiah call baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote 
from the mouth of jeremiah all the word of the lord which he had 
spoken unto him upon a roll of a book 

36 5 and jeremiah command baruch say i am shut up i cannot go 
into the hou of the lord 36 6 therefor go thou and read in the 
roll which thou hast written from my mouth the word of the lord in 
the ear of the peopl in the lord s hou upon the fast day and 
also thou shalt read them in the ear of all judah that come out of 
their citi 

36 7 it may be they will present their supplic befor the lord 
and will return everi one from hi evil way for great is the anger 
and the furi that the lord hath pronounc against thi peopl 

36 8 and baruch the son of neriah did accord to all that jeremiah 
the prophet command him read in the book the word of the lord 
in the lord s hou 

36 9 and it came to pa in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of 
josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaim a fast 
befor the lord to all the peopl in jerusalem and to all the peopl 
that came from the citi of judah unto jerusalem 

36 10 then read baruch in the book the word of jeremiah in the hou 
of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe 
in the higher court at the entri of the new gate of the lord s hou 
in the ear of all the peopl 

36 11 when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard 
out of the book all the word of the lord 36 12 then he went down 
into the king s hou into the scribe s chamber and lo all the 
princ sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of 
shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of 
shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princ 

36 13 then michaiah declar unto them all the word that he had 
heard when baruch read the book in the ear of the peopl 

36 14 therefor all the princ sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the 
son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch say take in thine 
hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ear of the peopl and 
come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in hi hand and came 
unto them 

36 15 and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ear 
so baruch read it in their ear 

36 16 now it came to pa when they had heard all the word they 
were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will sure 
tell the king of all these word 

36 17 and they ask baruch say tell u now how didst thou write 
all these word at hi mouth 36 18 then baruch answer them he 
pronounc all these word unto me with hi mouth and i wrote them 
with ink in the book 

36 19 then said the princ unto baruch go hide thee thou and 
jeremiah and let no man know where ye be 

36 20 and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up 
the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the word 
in the ear of the king 

36 21 so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of 
elishama the scribe s chamber and jehudi read it in the ear of the 
king and in the ear of all the princ which stood besid the king 

36 22 now the king sat in the winterh in the ninth month and 
there wa a fire on the hearth burn befor him 

36 23 and it came to pa that when jehudi had read three or four 
leaf he cut it with the penknif and cast it into the fire that 
wa on the hearth until all the roll wa consum in the fire that 
wa on the hearth 

36 24 yet they were not afraid nor rent their garment neither the 
king nor ani of hi servant that heard all these word 

36 25 nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made 
intercess to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would 
not hear them 

36 26 but the king command jerahmeel the son of hammelech and 
seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take 
baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them 

36 27 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king 
had burn the roll and the word which baruch wrote at the mouth of 
jeremiah say 36 28 take thee again anoth roll and write in it 
all the former word that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the 
king of judah hath burn 

36 29 and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thu saith the 
lord thou hast burn thi roll say whi hast thou written 
therein say the king of babylon shall certainli come and destroy 
thi land and shall cau to cea from thenc man and beast 36 30 
therefor thu saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall 
have none to sit upon the throne of david and hi dead bodi shall be 
cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost 

36 31 and i will punish him and hi seed and hi servant for their 
iniqu and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabit of 
jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have 
pronounc against them but they hearken not 

36 32 then took jeremiah anoth roll and gave it to baruch the 
scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of 
jeremiah all the word of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had 
burn in the fire and there were ad besid unto them mani like 
word 

37 1 and king zedekiah the son of josiah reign instead of coniah the 
son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the 
land of judah 

37 2 but neither he nor hi servant nor the peopl of the land did 
hearken unto the word of the lord which he spake by the prophet

not put him into prison 

37 5 then pharaoh s armi wa come forth out of egypt and when the 
chaldean that besieg jerusalem heard tide of them they depart

37 6 then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah say

and take it and burn it with fire 

37 9 thu saith the lord deceiv not yourselv say the 
chaldean shall sure depart from u for they shall not depart 

37 10 for though ye had smitten the whole armi of the chaldean that 
fight against you and there remain but wound men among them yet 
should they rise up everi man in hi tent and burn thi citi with 
fire 

37 11 and it came to pa that when the armi of the chaldean wa 
broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaoh s armi 37 12 then 
jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin 
to separ himself thenc in the midst of the peopl 

37 13 and when he wa in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward 
wa there whose name wa irijah the son of shelemiah the son of 
hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet say thou fallest away 
to the chaldean 

37 14 then said jeremiah it is fal i fall not away to the 
chaldean 

but he hearken not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him 
to the princ 

37 15 wherefor the princ were wroth with jeremiah and smote him 
and put him in prison in the hou of jonathan the scribe for they 
had made that the prison 

37 16 when jeremiah wa enter into the dungeon and into the cabin 
and jeremiah had remain there mani day 37 17 then zedekiah the 
king sent and took him out and the king ask him secretli in hi 
hou and said is there ani word from the lord and jeremiah said 
there is for said he thou shalt be deliv into the hand of the 
king of babylon 

37 18 moreov jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offend 
against thee or against thi servant or against thi peopl that ye

37 21 then zedekiah the king command that they should commit 
jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him 
daili a piec of bread out of the baker street until all the bread 
in the citi were spent 

thu jeremiah remain in the court of the prison 

38 1 then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of 
pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of 
malchiah heard the word that jeremiah had spoken unto all the 
peopl say 38 2 thu saith the lord he that remaineth in thi 
citi shall die by the sword by the famin and by the pestil but 
he that goeth forth to the chaldean shall live for he shall have hi 
life for a prey and shall live 

38 3 thu saith the lord thi citi shall sure be given into the 
hand of the king of babylon s armi which shall take it 

38 4 therefor the princ said unto the king we beseech thee let 
thi man be put to death for thu he weakeneth the hand of the men 
of war that remain in thi citi and the hand of all the peopl in 
speak such word unto them for thi man seeketh not the welfar of 
thi peopl but the hurt 

38 5 then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the 
king is not he that can do ani thing against you 

38 6 then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of 
malchiah the son of hammelech that wa in the court of the prison 
and they let down jeremiah with cord and in the dungeon there wa no 
water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire 

38 7 now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuch which wa 
in the king s hou heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon 
the king then sit in the gate of benjamin 38 8 ebedmelech went 
forth out of the king s hou and spake to the king say 38 9 my 
lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to 
jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is 
like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more 
bread in the citi 

38 10 then the king command ebedmelech the ethiopian say take 
from henc thirti men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out 
of the dungeon befor he die 

38 11 so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the hou of 
the king under the treasuri and took thenc old cast clout and old 
rotten rag and let them down by cord into the dungeon to jeremiah 

38 12 and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these 
old cast clout and rotten rag under thine armhol under the cord 
and jeremiah did so 

38 13 so they drew up jeremiah with cord and took him up out of the 
dungeon and jeremiah remain in the court of the prison 

38 14 then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto 
him into the third entri that is in the hou of the lord and the 
king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide noth from 
me 

38 15 then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declar it unto thee 
wilt thou not sure put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt 
thou not hearken unto me 38 16 so zedekiah the king sware secretli 
unto jeremiah say a the lord liveth that made u thi soul i 
will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of 
these men that seek thi life 

38 17 then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thu saith the lord the god 
of host the god of israel if thou wilt assuredli go forth unto the 
king of babylon s princ then thi soul shall live and thi citi 
shall not be burn with fire and thou shalt live and thine hou 
38 18 but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylon s princ 
then shall thi citi be given into the hand of the chaldean and they 
shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escap out of their hand 

38 19 and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the 
jew that are fallen to the chaldean lest they deliv me into their 
hand and they mock me 

38 20 but jeremiah said they shall not deliv thee obey i beseech 
thee the voic of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be 
well unto thee and thi soul shall live 

38 21 but if thou refu to go forth thi is the word that the lord 
hath shew me 38 22 and behold all the woman that are left in the 
king of judah s hou shall be brought forth to the king of babylon s 
princ and those woman shall say thi friend have set thee on and 
have prevail against thee thi foot are sunk in the mire and they 
are turn away back 

38 23 so they shall bring out all thi wife and thi child to the 
chaldean and thou shalt not escap out of their hand but shalt be 
taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cau thi 
citi to be burn with fire 

38 24 then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these 
word and thou shalt not die 

38 25 but if the princ hear that i have talk with thee and they 
come unto thee and say unto thee declar unto u now what thou hast 
said unto the king hide it not from u and we will not put thee to 
death also what the king said unto thee 38 26 then thou shalt say 
unto them i present my supplic befor the king that he would 
not cau me to return to jonathan s hou to die there 

38 27 then came all the princ unto jeremiah and ask him and he 
told them accord to all these word that the king had command so 
they left off speak with him for the matter wa not perceiv 

38 28 so jeremiah abod in the court of the prison until the day that 
jerusalem wa taken and he wa there when jerusalem wa taken 

39 1 in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month 
came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all hi armi against 
jerusalem and they besieg it 

39 2 and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the 
ninth day of the month the citi wa broken up 

39 3 and all the princ of the king of babylon came in and sat in 
the middl gate even nergalsharez samgarnebo sarsechim rabsari 
nergalsharez rabmag with all the residu of the princ of the 
king of babylon 

39 4 and it came to pa that when zedekiah the king of judah saw 
them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of 
the citi by night by the way of the king s garden by the gate 
betwixt the two wall and he went out the way of the plain 

39 5 but the chaldean armi pursu after them and overtook zedekiah 
in the plain of jericho and when they had taken him they brought 
him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of 
hamath where he gave judgment upon him 

39 6 then the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah in riblah 
befor hi eye also the king of babylon slew all the nobl of 
judah 

39 7 moreov he put out zedekiah s eye and bound him with chain 
to carri him to babylon 

39 8 and the chaldean burn the king s hou and the hou of the 
peopl with fire and brake down the wall of jerusalem 

39 9 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carri away captiv 
into babylon the remnant of the peopl that remain in the citi and 
those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the peopl 
that remain 

39 10 but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the 
peopl which had noth in the land of judah and gave them 
vineyard and field at the same time 

39 11 now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charg concern 
jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard say 39 12 take 
him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even a 
he shall say unto thee 

39 13 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban 
rabsari and nergalsharez rabmag and all the king of babylon s 
princ 39 14 even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of 
the prison and commit him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son 
of shaphan that he should carri him home so he dwelt among the 
peopl 

39 15 now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he wa shut 
up in the court of the prison say 39 16 go and speak to 
ebedmelech the ethiopian say thu saith the lord of host the 
god of israel behold i will bring my word upon thi citi for evil 
and not for good and they shall be accomplish in that day befor

39 17 but i will deliv thee in that day saith the lord and thou 
shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid 

39 18 for i will sure deliv thee and thou shalt not fall by the 
sword but thi life shall be for a prey unto thee becau thou hast 
put thi trust in me saith the lord 

40 1 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that 
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when 
he had taken him be bound in chain among all that were carri 
away captiv of jerusalem and judah which were carri away captiv

40 2 and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him

40 3 now the lord hath brought it and done accord a he hath said 
becau ye have sin against the lord and have not obey hi

40 5 now while he wa not yet gone back he said go back also to 
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of 
babylon hath made governor over the citi of judah and dwell with 
him among the peopl or go wheresoev it seemeth conveni unto 
thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victual and a 
reward and let him go 

40 6 then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and 
dwelt with him among the peopl that were left in the land 

40 7 now when all the captain of the forc which were in the field 
even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made 
gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had commit 
unto him men and woman and child and of the poor of the land of 
them that were not carri away captiv to babylon 40 8 then they 
came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and 
johanan and jonathan the son of kareah and seraiah the son of 
tanhumeth and the son of ephai the netophathit and jezaniah the

40 9 and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them 
and to their men say fear not to serv the chaldean dwell in 
the land and serv the king of babylon and it shall be well with 
you 

40 10 a for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serv the 
chaldean which will come unto u but ye gather ye wine and summer 
fruit and oil and put them in your vessel and dwell in your 
citi that ye have taken 

40 11 likewi when all the jew that were in moab and among the 
ammonit and in edom and that were in all the countri heard that 
the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set 
over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan 40 12 even 
all the jew return out of all place whither they were driven and 
came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gather wine 
and summer fruit veri much 

40 13 moreov johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the 
forc that were in the field came to gedaliah to mizpah 40 14 and 
said unto him dost thou certainli know that baali the king of the 
ammonit hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but 
gedaliah the son of ahikam believ them not 

40 15 then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah 
secretli say let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the 
son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefor should he slay 
thee that all the jew which are gather unto thee should be 
scatter and the remnant in judah perish 40 16 but gedaliah the 
son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do 
thi thing for thou speakest fal of ishmael 

41 1 now it came to pa in the seventh month that ishmael the son of 
nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princ of 
the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam 
to mizpah and there they did eat bread togeth in mizpah 

41 2 then aro ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that 
were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan 
with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made 
governor over the land 

41 3 ishmael also slew all the jew that were with him even with 
gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldean that were found there and the 
men of war 

41 4 and it came to pa the second day after he had slain gedaliah 
and no man knew it 41 5 that there came certain from shechem from 
shiloh and from samaria even fourscor men have their beard 
shaven and their cloth rent and have cut themselv with 
offer and incen in their hand to bring them to the hou of the 
lord 

41 6 and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet 
them weep all along a he went and it came to pa a he met 
them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam 

41 7 and it wa so when they came into the midst of the citi that 
ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst 
of the pit he and the men that were with him 

41 8 but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay u 
not for we have treasur in the field of wheat and of barley and 
of oil and of honey so he forbar and slew them not among their 
brother 

41 9 now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodi of the 
men whom he had slain becau of gedaliah wa it which asa the king 
had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of 
nethaniah fill it with them that were slain 

41 10 then ishmael carri away captiv all the residu of the peopl 
that were in mizpah even the king s daughter and all the peopl 
that remain in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had 
commit to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of 
nethaniah carri them away captiv and depart to go over to the 
ammonit 

41 11 but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the 
forc that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son 
of nethaniah had done 41 12 then they took all the men and went to 
fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great 
water that are in gibeon 

41 13 now it came to pa that when all the peopl which were with 
ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the 
forc that were with him then they were glad 

41 14 so all the peopl that ishmael had carri away captiv from 
mizpah cast about and return and went unto johanan the son of 
kareah 

41 15 but ishmael the son of nethaniah escap from johanan with eight 
men and went to the ammonit 

41 16 then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the 
forc that were with him all the remnant of the peopl whom he had 
recov from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that 
he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighti men of war and 
the woman and the child and the eunuch whom he had brought 
again from gibeon 41 17 and they depart and dwelt in the 
habit of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into 
egypt 41 18 becau of the chaldean for they were afraid of them 
becau ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of 
ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land 

42 1 then all the captain of the forc and johanan the son of 
kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the peopl from the 
least even unto the greatest came near 42 2 and said unto jeremiah 
the prophet let we beseech thee our supplic be accept befor 
thee and pray for u unto the lord thi god even for all thi 
remnant for we are left but a few of mani a thine eye do behold 
u 42 3 that the lord thi god may shew u the way wherein we may 
walk and the thing that we may do 

42 4 then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you 
behold i will pray unto the lord your god accord to your word 
and it shall come to pa that whatsoev thing the lord shall answer 
you i will declar it unto you i will keep noth back from you 

42 5 then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faith 
wit between u if we do not even accord to all thing for the 
which the lord thi god shall send thee to u 

42 6 whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voic 
of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with 
u when we obey the voic of the lord our god 

42 7 and it came to pa after ten day that the word of the lord 
came unto jeremiah 

42 8 then call he johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of 
the forc which were with him and all the peopl from the least even 
to the greatest 42 9 and said unto them thu saith the lord the god 
of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplic befor 
him 42 10 if ye will still abid in thi land then will i build you 
and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for 
i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you 

42 11 be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be 
not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and 
to deliv you from hi hand 

42 12 and i will shew merci unto you that he may have merci upon 
you and cau you to return to your own land 

42 13 but if ye say we will not dwell in thi land neither obey the 
voic of the lord your god 42 14 say no but we will go into the 
land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the 
trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell 42 15 and 
now therefor hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thu 
saith the lord of host the god of israel if ye wholli set your 
face to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there 42 16 then it 
shall come to pa that the sword which ye fear shall overtak 
you there in the land of egypt and the famin whereof ye were 
afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye 
shall die 

42 17 so shall it be with all the men that set their face to go into 
egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famin 
and by the pestil and none of them shall remain or escap from 
the evil that i will bring upon them 

42 18 for thu saith the lord of host the god of israel a mine 
anger and my furi hath been pour forth upon the inhabit of 
jerusalem so shall my furi be pour forth upon you when ye shall 
enter into egypt and ye shall be an execr and an astonish 
and a cur and a reproach and ye shall see thi place no more 

42 19 the lord hath said concern you o ye remnant of judah go ye 
not into egypt know certainli that i have admonish you thi day 

42 20 for ye dissembl in your heart when ye sent me unto the lord 
your god say pray for u unto the lord our god and accord 
unto all that the lord our god shall say so declar unto u and we 
will do it 

42 21 and now i have thi day declar it to you but ye have not 
obey the voic of the lord your god nor ani thing for the which he 
hath sent me unto you 

42 22 now therefor know certainli that ye shall die by the sword by 
the famin and by the pestil in the place whither ye desir to 
go and to sojourn 

43 1 and it came to pa that when jeremiah had made an end of 
speak unto all the peopl all the word of the lord their god for 
which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these word 
43 2 then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of 
kareah and all the proud men say unto jeremiah thou speakest 
fal the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt 
to sojourn there 43 3 but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on 
against u for to deliv u into the hand of the chaldean that 
they might put u to death and carri u away captiv into babylon 

43 4 so johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the forc 
and all the peopl obey not the voic of the lord to dwell in the 
land of judah 

43 5 but johanan the son of kareah and all the captain of the 
forc took all the remnant of judah that were return from all 
nation whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah 
43 6 even men and woman and child and the king s daughter and 
everi person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with 
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the 
prophet and baruch the son of neriah 

43 7 so they came into the land of egypt for they obey not the 
voic of the lord thu came they even to tahpanh 

43 8 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanh 
say 43 9 take great stone in thine hand and hide them in the 
clay in the brickkiln which is at the entri of pharaoh s hou in 
tahpanh in the sight of the men of judah 43 10 and say unto them 
thu saith the lord of host the god of israel behold i will send 
and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set 
hi throne upon these stone that i have hid and he shall spread hi 
royal pavilion over them 

43 11 and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and 
deliv such a are for death to death and such a are for captiv 
to captiv and such a are for the sword to the sword 

43 12 and i will kindl a fire in the hou of the god of egypt and 
he shall burn them and carri them away captiv and he shall array 
himself with the land of egypt a a shepherd putteth on hi garment 
and he shall go forth from thenc in peac 

43 13 he shall break also the imag of bethshemesh that is in the 
land of egypt and the hou of the god of the egyptian shall he 
burn with fire 

44 1 the word that came to jeremiah concern all the jew which 
dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanh 
and at noph and in the countri of pathro say 44 2 thu saith 
the lord of host the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i 
have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the citi of judah and 
behold thi day they are a desol and no man dwelleth therein 
44 3 becau of their wick which they have commit to provok 
me to anger in that they went to burn incen and to serv other 
god whom they knew not neither they ye nor your father 

44 4 howbeit i sent unto you all my servant the prophet rise 
earli and send them say oh do not thi abomin thing that 
i hate 

44 5 but they hearken not nor inclin their ear to turn from their 
wick to burn no incen unto other god 

44 6 wherefor my furi and mine anger wa pour forth and wa 
kindl in the citi of judah and in the street of jerusalem and 
they are wast and desol a at thi day 

44 7 therefor now thu saith the lord the god of host the god of 
israel wherefor commit ye thi great evil against your soul to cut 
off from you man and woman child and suckl out of judah to leav 
you none to remain 44 8 in that ye provok me unto wrath with the 
work of your hand burn incen unto other god in the land of 
egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselv off 
and that ye might be a cur and a reproach among all the nation of 
the earth 44 9 have ye forgotten the wick of your father and 
the wick of the king of judah and the wick of their 
wife and your own wick and the wick of your wife 
which they have commit in the land of judah and in the street of 
jerusalem 44 10 they are not humbl even unto thi day neither 
have they fear nor walk in my law nor in my statut that i set 
befor you and befor your father 

44 11 therefor thu saith the lord of host the god of israel 
behold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all 
judah 

44 12 and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their face 
to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be 
consum and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consum 
by the sword and by the famin they shall die from the least even 
unto the greatest by the sword and by the famin and they shall be 
an execr and an astonish and a cur and a reproach 

44 13 for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt a i 
have punish jerusalem by the sword by the famin and by the 
pestil 44 14 so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone 
into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escap or remain that 
they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a 
desir to return to dwell there for none shall return but such a

out of the fire went forth lightn 

1 14 and the live creatur ran and return a the appear of a

over their head abov 

1 23 and under the firmament were their wing straight the one toward 
the other everi one had two which cover on thi side and everi

1 24 and when they went i heard the noi of their wing like the

1 25 and there wa a voic from the firmament that wa over their

2 2 and the spirit enter into me when he spake unto me and set me 
upon my foot that i heard him that spake unto me 

2 3 and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the child of 
israel to a rebelli nation that hath rebel against me they and 
their father have transgress against me even unto thi veri day 

2 4 for they are impud child and stiffheart i do send thee

2 5 and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear 
for they are a rebelli hou yet shall know that there hath been 
a prophet among them 

2 6 and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of 
their word though brier and thorn be with thee and thou dost 
dwell among scorpion be not afraid of their word nor be dismay 
at their look though they be a rebelli hou 

2 7 and thou shalt speak my word unto them whether they will hear 
or whether they will forbear for they are most rebelli 

2 8 but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou

3 5 for thou art not sent to a peopl of a strang speech and of an 
hard languag but to the hou of israel 3 6 not to mani peopl of a 
strang speech and of an hard languag whose word thou canst not 
understand sure had i sent thee to them they would have hearken 
unto thee 

3 7 but the hou of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will 
not hearken unto me for all the hou of israel are impud and 
hardheart 

3 8 behold i have made thi face strong against their face and thi 
forehead strong against their forehead 

3 9 a an adam harder than flint have i made thi forehead fear

behold at the door of the templ of the lord between the porch and 
the altar were about five and twenti men with their back toward the 
templ of the lord and their face toward the east and they 
worship the sun toward the east 

8 17 then he said unto me hast thou seen thi o son of man is it a 
light thing to the hou of judah that they commit the abomin 
which they commit here for they have fill the land with violenc 
and have return to provok me to anger and lo they put the branch

9 8 and it came to pa while they were slay them and i wa left

and the citi full of perver for they say the lord hath 
forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not 

9 10 and a for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have

9 11 and behold the man cloth with linen which had the inkhorn by

coal of fire from between the cherub and scatter them over the 
citi and he went in in my sight 

10 3 now the cherub stood on the right side of the hou when the 
man went in and the cloud fill the inner court 

10 4 then the glori of the lord went up from the cherub and stood 
over the threshold of the hou and the hou wa fill with the 
cloud and the court wa full of the bright of the lord s glori 

10 5 and the sound of the cherub wing wa heard even to the outer 
court a the voic of the almighti god when he speaketh 

10 6 and it came to pa that when he had command the man cloth 
with linen say take fire from between the wheel from between

10 7 and one cherub stretch forth hi hand from between the 
cherub unto the fire that wa between the cherub and took

who took it and went out 

10 8 and there appear in the cherub the form of a man s hand

10 9 and when i look behold the four wheel by the cherub one 
wheel by one cherub and anoth wheel by anoth cherub and the 
appear of the wheel wa a the colour of a beryl stone 

10 10 and a for their appear they four had one like a if 
a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel 

10 11 when they went they went upon their four side they turn not 
a they went but to the place whither the head look they follow 
it they turn not a they went 

10 12 and their whole bodi and their back and their hand and 
their wing and the wheel were full of eye round about even the 
wheel that they four had 

10 13 a for the wheel it wa cri unto them in my hear o 
wheel 

10 14 and everi one had four face the first face wa the face of a 
cherub and the second face wa the face of a man and the third the 
face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagl 

10 15 and the cherub were lift up thi is the live creatur 
that i saw by the river of chebar 

10 16 and when the cherub went the wheel went by them and when 
the cherub lift up their wing to mount up from the earth the 
same wheel also turn not from besid them 

10 17 when they stood these stood and when they were lift up 
these lift up themselv also for the spirit of the live creatur 
wa in them 

10 18 then the glori of the lord depart from off the threshold of 
the hou and stood over the cherub 

10 19 and the cherub lift up their wing and mount up from the 
earth in my sight when they went out the wheel also were besid 
them and everi one stood at the door of the east gate of the lord s 
hou and the glori of the god of israel wa over them abov 

10 20 thi is the live creatur that i saw under the god of israel 
by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherub 

10 21 everi one had four face apiec and everi one four wing and 
the like of the hand of a man wa under their wing 

10 22 and the like of their face wa the same face which i saw

everi one straight forward 

11 1 moreov the spirit lift me up and brought me unto the east 
gate of the lord s hou which looketh eastward and behold at the 
door of the gate five and twenti men among whom i saw jaazaniah the 
son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princ of the peopl 

11 2 then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devi 
mischief and give wick counsel in thi citi 11 3 which say it is 
not near let u build hou thi citi is the caldron and we be the 
flesh 

11 4 therefor prophesi against them prophesi o son of man 

11 5 and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak 
thu saith the lord thu have ye said o hou of israel for i know 
the thing that come into your mind everi one of them 

11 6 ye have multipli your slain in thi citi and ye have fill 
the street thereof with the slain 

11 7 therefor thu saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid 
in the midst of it they are the flesh and thi citi is the caldron 
but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it 

11 8 ye have fear the sword and i will bring a sword upon you 
saith the lord god 

11 9 and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliv you 
into the hand of stranger and will execut judgment among you 

11 10 ye shall fall by the sword i will judg you in the border of 
israel and ye shall know that i am the lord 

11 11 thi citi shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the 
flesh in the midst thereof but i will judg you in the border of 
israel 11 12 and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not 
walk in my statut neither execut my judgment but have done 
after the manner of the heathen that are round about you 

11 13 and it came to pa when i prophesi that pelatiah the son of 
benaiah die then fell i down upon my face and cri with a loud 
voic and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant 
of israel 11 14 again the word of the lord came unto me say 
11 15 son of man thi brother even thi brother the men of thi 
kindr and all the hou of israel wholli are they unto whom the 
inhabit of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto u 
is thi land given in poss 

11 16 therefor say thu saith the lord god although i have cast 
them far off among the heathen and although i have scatter them 
among the countri yet will i be to them a a littl sanctuari in 
the countri where they shall come 

11 17 therefor say thu saith the lord god i will even gather you 
from the peopl and assembl you out of the countri where ye have 
been scatter and i will give you the land of israel 

11 18 and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the 
detest thing thereof and all the abomin thereof from 
thenc 

11 19 and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit 
within you and i will take the stoni heart out of their flesh and 
will give them an heart of flesh 11 20 that they may walk in my 
statut and keep mine ordin and do them and they shall be my 
peopl and i will be their god 

11 21 but a for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their 
detest thing and their abomin i will recompen their way 
upon their own head saith the lord god 

11 22 then did the cherub lift up their wing and the wheel 
besid them and the glori of the god of israel wa over them abov 

11 23 and the glori of the lord went up from the midst of the citi 
and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the citi 

11 24 afterward the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by 
the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captiv so the 
vision that i had seen went up from me 

11 25 then i spake unto them of the captiv all the thing that the 
lord had shew me 

12 1 the word of the lord also came unto me say 12 2 son of man

see and see not they have ear to hear and hear not for they are a 
rebelli hou 

12 3 therefor thou son of man prepar thee stuff for remov and 
remov by day in their sight and thou shalt remov from thi place to 
anoth place in their sight it may be they will consid though 
they be a rebelli hou 

12 4 then shalt thou bring forth thi stuff by day in their sight a 
stuff for remov and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight a 
they that go forth into captiv 

12 5 dig thou through the wall in their sight and carri out therebi 

12 6 in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thi shoulder and carri 
it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thi face that thou see not 
the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the hou of israel 

12 7 and i did so a i wa command i brought forth my stuff by day 
a stuff for captiv and in the even i dig through the wall with 
mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my 
shoulder in their sight 

12 8 and in the morn came the word of the lord unto me say 
12 9 son of man hath not the hou of israel the rebelli hou 
said unto thee what doest thou 12 10 say thou unto them thu saith 
the lord god thi burden concerneth the princ in jerusalem and all 
the hou of israel that are among them 

12 11 say i am your sign like a i have done so shall it be done 
unto them they shall remov and go into captiv 

12 12 and the princ that is among them shall bear upon hi shoulder 
in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall 
to carri out therebi he shall cover hi face that he see not the 
ground with hi eye 

12 13 my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my 
snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldean 
yet shall he not see it though he shall die there 

12 14 and i will scatter toward everi wind all that are about him to 
help him and all hi band and i will draw out the sword after them 

12 15 and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter 
them among the nation and disper them in the countri 

12 16 but i will leav a few men of them from the sword from the 
famin and from the pestil that they may declar all their 
abomin among the heathen whither they come and they shall know 
that i am the lord 

12 17 moreov the word of the lord came to me say 12 18 son of 
man eat thi bread with quak and drink thi water with trembl 
and with care 12 19 and say unto the peopl of the land thu 
saith the lord god of the inhabit of jerusalem and of the land of 
israel they shall eat their bread with care and drink their 
water with astonish that her land may be desol from all that 
is therein becau of the violenc of all them that dwell therein 

12 20 and the citi that are inhabit shall be laid wast and the 
land shall be desol and ye shall know that i am the lord 

12 21 and the word of the lord came unto me say 12 22 son of man

12 25 for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak 
shall come to pa it shall be no more prolong for in your day o 
rebelli hou will i say the word and will perform it saith the 
lord god 

12 26 again the word of the lord came to me say

that he seeth is for mani day to come and he prophesieth of the 
time that are far off 

12 28 therefor say unto them thu saith the lord god there shall

13 5 ye have not gone up into the gap neither made up the hedg for 
the hou of israel to stand in the battl in the day of the lord 

13 6 they have seen vaniti and lie divin say the lord 
saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made other to 
hope that they would confirm the word 

13 7 have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lie 
divin wherea ye say the lord saith it albeit i have not 
spoken 13 8 therefor thu saith the lord god becau ye have 
spoken vaniti and seen lie therefor behold i am against you

13 9 and mine hand shall be upon the prophet that see vaniti and 
that divin lie they shall not be in the assembl of my peopl 
neither shall they be written in the write of the hou of israel 
neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know

13 10 becau even becau they have seduc my peopl say 
peac and there wa no peac and one built up a wall and lo 
other daub it with untemp morter 13 11 say unto them which 
daub it with untemp morter that it shall fall there shall be an 
overflow shower and ye o great hailston shall fall and a 
stormi wind shall rend it 

13 12 lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you

wall is no more neither they that daub it 13 16 to wit the 
prophet of israel which prophesi concern jerusalem and which see 
vision of peac for her and there is no peac saith the lord god 

13 17 likewi thou son of man set thi face against the daughter of 
thi peopl which prophesi out of their own heart and prophesi thou

pollut me among my peopl for hand of barley and for piec of 
bread to slay the soul that should not die and to save the soul 
aliv that should not live by your lie to my peopl that hear your 
lie 13 20 wherefor thu saith the lord god behold i am against

14 1 then came certain of the elder of israel unto me and sat befor 
me 

14 2 and the word of the lord came unto me say 14 3 son of man 
these men have set up their idol in their heart and put the 
stumblingblock of their iniqu befor their face should i be

unto them thu saith the lord god everi man of the hou of israel 
that setteth up hi idol in hi heart and putteth the stumblingblock 
of hi iniqu befor hi face and cometh to the prophet i the lord 
will answer him that cometh accord to the multitud of hi idol 
14 5 that i may take the hou of israel in their own heart becau 
they are all estrang from me through their idol 

14 6 therefor say unto the hou of israel thu saith the lord god 
repent and turn yourselv from your idol and turn away your face 
from all your abomin 

14 7 for everi one of the hou of israel or of the stranger that 
sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up 
hi idol in hi heart and putteth the stumblingblock of hi iniqu 
befor hi face and cometh to a prophet to enquir of him concern 
me i the lord will answer him by myself 14 8 and i will set my face 
against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will 
cut him off from the midst of my peopl and ye shall know that i am 
the lord 

14 9 and if the prophet be deceiv when he hath spoken a thing i the 
lord have deceiv that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon 
him and will destroy him from the midst of my peopl israel 

14 10 and they shall bear the punish of their iniqu the 
punish of the prophet shall be even a the punish of him that 
seeketh unto him 14 11 that the hou of israel may go no more astray 
from me neither be pollut ani more with all their transgress 
but that they may be my peopl and i may be their god saith the lord 
god 

14 12 the word of the lord came again to me say 14 13 son of man 
when the land sinneth against me by trespass grievou then will 
i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread 
thereof and will send famin upon it and will cut off man and beast

14 15 if i cau noisom beast to pa through the land and they 
spoil it so that it be desol that no man may pa through becau 
of the beast 14 16 though these three men were in it a i live

they onli shall be deliv but the land shall be desol 

14 17 or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through

daniel and job were in it a i live saith the lord god they shall 
deliv neither son nor daughter they shall but deliv their own 
soul by their righteou 

14 21 for thu saith the lord god how much more when i send my four

17 1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 17 2 son of man 
put forth a riddl and speak a parabl unto the hou of israel 17 3 
and say thu saith the lord god a great eagl with great wing 
longw full of feather which had diver colour came unto 
lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar 17 4 he crop off 
the top of hi young twig and carri it into a land of traffick he 
set it in a citi of merchant 

17 5 he took also of the seed of the land and plant it in a 
fruit field he place it by great water and set it a a willow 
tree 

17 6 and it grew and becam a spread vine of low statur whose 
branch turn toward him and the root thereof were under him so 
it becam a vine and brought forth branch and shot forth sprig 

17 7 there wa also anoth great eagl with great wing and mani 
feather and behold thi vine did bend her root toward him and 
shot forth her branch toward him that he might water it by the 
furrow of her plantat 

17 8 it wa plant in a good soil by great water that it might 
bring forth branch and that it might bear fruit that it might be a 
goodli vine 

17 9 say thou thu saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not 
pull up the root thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it 
wither it shall wither in all the leaf of her spring even without 
great power or mani peopl to pluck it up by the root thereof 

17 10 yea behold be plant shall it prosper shall it not 
utterli wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the 
furrow where it grew 

17 11 moreov the word of the lord came unto me say 17 12 say 
now to the rebelli hou know ye not what these thing mean tell 
them behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath taken 
the king thereof and the princ thereof and led them with him to 
babylon 17 13 and hath taken of the king s seed and made a coven 
with him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mighti 
of the land 17 14 that the kingdom might be base that it might not 
lift itself up but that by keep of hi coven it might stand 

17 15 but he rebel against him in send hi ambassador into 
egypt that they might give him hor and much peopl shall he 
prosper shall he escap that doeth such thing or shall he break the 
coven and be deliv 17 16 a i live saith the lord god 
sure in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose 
oath he despi and whose coven he brake even with him in the 
midst of babylon he shall die 

17 17 neither shall pharaoh with hi mighti armi and great compani 
make for him in the war by cast up mount and build fort to 
cut off mani person 17 18 see he despi the oath by break 
the coven when lo he had given hi hand and hath done all these 
thing he shall not escap 

17 19 therefor thu saith the lord god a i live sure mine oath 
that he hath despi and my coven that he hath broken even it 
will i recompen upon hi own head 

17 20 and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my 
snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there 
for hi trespass that he hath trespass against me 

17 21 and all hi fugit with all hi band shall fall by the 
sword and they that remain shall be scatter toward all wind and 
ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it 

17 22 thu saith the lord god i will also take of the highest branch 
of the high cedar and will set it i will crop off from the top of 
hi young twig a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain 
and emin 17 23 in the mountain of the height of israel will i 
plant it and it shall bring forth bough and bear fruit and be a 
goodli cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of everi wing in the 
shadow of the branch thereof shall they dwell 

17 24 and all the tree of the field shall know that i the lord have 
brought down the high tree have exalt the low tree have dri up 
the green tree and have made the dri tree to flourish i the lord 
have spoken and have done it 

18 1 the word of the lord came unto me again say 18 2 what mean 
ye that ye use thi proverb concern the land of israel say 
the father have eaten sour grape and the child s teeth are set 
on edg 18 3 a i live saith the lord god ye shall not have 
occa ani more to use thi proverb in israel 

18 4 behold all soul are mine a the soul of the father so also 
the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die 

18 5 but if a man be just and do that which is law and right 18 6 
and hath not eaten upon the mountain neither hath lift up hi eye 
to the idol of the hou of israel neither hath defil hi 
neighbour s wife neither hath come near to a menstruou woman 18 7 
and hath not oppress ani but hath restor to the debtor hi 
pledg hath spoil none by violenc hath given hi bread to the 
hungri and hath cover the nake with a garment 18 8 he that hath 
not given forth upon usuri neither hath taken ani increa that hath 
withdrawn hi hand from iniqu hath execut true judgment between 
man and man 18 9 hath walk in my statut and hath kept my 
judgment to deal truli he is just he shall sure live saith the 
lord god 

18 10 if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that 
doeth the like to ani one of these thing 18 11 and that doeth not 
ani of those duti but even hath eaten upon the mountain and 
defil hi neighbour s wife 18 12 hath oppress the poor and needi 
hath spoil by violenc hath not restor the pledg and hath 
lift up hi eye to the idol hath commit abomin 18 13 
hath given forth upon usuri and hath taken increa shall he then 
live he shall not live he hath done all these abomin he shall 
sure die hi blood shall be upon him 

18 14 now lo if he beget a son that seeth all hi father s sin 
which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like 18 15 
that hath not eaten upon the mountain neither hath lift up hi 
eye to the idol of the hou of israel hath not defil hi 
neighbour s wife 18 16 neither hath oppress ani hath not 
withholden the pledg neither hath spoil by violenc but hath 
given hi bread to the hungri and hath cover the nake with a 
garment 18 17 that hath taken off hi hand from the poor that hath 
not receiv usuri nor increa hath execut my judgment hath 
walk in my statut he shall not die for the iniqu of hi 
father he shall sure live 

18 18 a for hi father becau he cruelli oppress spoil hi 
brother by violenc and did that which is not good among hi peopl 
lo even he shall die in hi iniqu 

18 19 yet say ye whi doth not the son bear the iniqu of the 
father when the son hath done that which is law and right and 
hath kept all my statut and hath done them he shall sure live 

18 20 the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the 
iniqu of the father neither shall the father bear the iniqu of 
the son the righteou of the righteou shall be upon him and the 
wick of the wick shall be upon him 

18 21 but if the wick will turn from all hi sin that he hath 
commit and keep all my statut and do that which is law and 
right he shall sure live he shall not die 

18 22 all hi transgress that he hath commit they shall not be 
mention unto him in hi righteou that he hath done he shall 
live 

18 23 have i ani pleasur at all that the wick should die saith the 
lord god and not that he should return from hi way and live 
18 24 but when the righteou turneth away from hi righteou and 
committeth iniqu and doeth accord to all the abomin that 
the wick man doeth shall he live all hi righteou that he 
hath done shall not be mention in hi trespass that he hath 
trespass and in hi sin that he hath sin in them shall he die 

18 25 yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o hou 
of israel is not my way equal are not your way unequ 18 26 when 
a righteou man turneth away from hi righteou and committeth 
iniqu and dieth in them for hi iniqu that he hath done shall 
he die 

18 27 again when the wick man turneth away from hi wick that 
he hath commit and doeth that which is law and right he shall 
save hi soul aliv 

18 28 becau he considereth and turneth away from all hi 
transgress that he hath commit he shall sure live he shall 
not die 

18 29 yet saith the hou of israel the way of the lord is not equal 
o hou of israel are not my way equal are not your way unequ 
18 30 therefor i will judg you o hou of israel everi one 
accord to hi way saith the lord god repent and turn yourselv 
from all your transgress so iniqu shall not be your ruin 

18 31 cast away from you all your transgress wherebi ye have 
transgress and make you a new heart and a new spirit for whi will 
ye die o hou of israel 18 32 for i have no pleasur in the death 
of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefor turn yourselv and 
live ye 

19 1 moreov take thou up a lament for the princ of israel 
19 2 and say what is thi mother a lioness she lay down among lion 
she nourish her whelp among young lion 

19 3 and she brought up one of her whelp it becam a young lion and 
it learn to catch the prey it devour men 

19 4 the nation also heard of him he wa taken in their pit and 
they brought him with chain unto the land of egypt 

19 5 now when she saw that she had wait and her hope wa lost then 
she took anoth of her whelp and made him a young lion 

19 6 and he went up and down among the lion he becam a young lion 
and learn to catch the prey and devour men 

19 7 and he knew their desol palac and he laid wast their 
citi and the land wa desol and the ful thereof by the 
noi of hi roar 

19 8 then the nation set against him on everi side from the 
provinc and spread their net over him he wa taken in their pit 

19 9 and they put him in ward in chain and brought him to the king 
of babylon they brought him into hold that hi voic should no more 
be heard upon the mountain of israel 

19 10 thi mother is like a vine in thi blood plant by the water 
she wa fruit and full of branch by reason of mani water 

19 11 and she had strong rod for the sceptr of them that bare rule 
and her statur wa exalt among the thick branch and she appear 
in her height with the multitud of her branch 

19 12 but she wa pluck up in furi she wa cast down to the ground 
and the east wind dri up her fruit her strong rod were broken and 
wither the fire consum them 

19 13 and now she is plant in the wilder in a dri and thirsti 
ground 

19 14 and fire is gone out of a rod of her branch which hath 
devour her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptr to 
rule thi is a lament and shall be for a lament 

20 1 and it came to pa in the seventh year in the fifth month the 
tenth day of the month that certain of the elder of israel came to 
enquir of the lord and sat befor me 

20 2 then came the word of the lord unto me say 20 3 son of man 
speak unto the elder of israel and say unto them thu saith the 
lord god are ye come to enquir of me a i live saith the lord god 
i will not be enquir of by you 

20 4 wilt thou judg them son of man wilt thou judg them cau 
them to know the abomin of their father 20 5 and say unto 
them thu saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and 
lift up mine hand unto the seed of the hou of jacob and made 
myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lift up mine 
hand unto them say i am the lord your god 20 6 in the day that i 
lift up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of 
egypt into a land that i had espi for them flow with milk and 
honey which is the glori of all land 20 7 then said i unto them 
cast ye away everi man the abomin of hi eye and defil not 
yourselv with the idol of egypt i am the lord your god 

20 8 but they rebel against me and would not hearken unto me they 
did not everi man cast away the abomin of their eye neither 
did they forsak the idol of egypt then i said i will pour out my 
furi upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of 
the land of egypt 

20 9 but i wrought for my name s sake that it should not be pollut 
befor the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself 
known unto them in bring them forth out of the land of egypt 

20 10 wherefor i cau them to go forth out of the land of egypt 
and brought them into the wilder 

20 11 and i gave them my statut and shew them my judgment which 
if a man do he shall even live in them 

20 12 moreov also i gave them my sabbath to be a sign between me 
and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctifi them 

20 13 but the hou of israel rebel against me in the wilder 
they walk not in my statut and they despi my judgment which 
if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbath they greatli 
pollut then i said i would pour out my furi upon them in the 
wilder to consum them 

20 14 but i wrought for my name s sake that it should not be pollut 
befor the heathen in whose sight i brought them out 

20 15 yet also i lift up my hand unto them in the wilder that i 
would not bring them into the land which i had given them flow 
with milk and honey which is the glori of all land 20 16 becau 
they despi my judgment and walk not in my statut but 
pollut my sabbath for their heart went after their idol 

20 17 nevertheless mine eye spare them from destroy them neither 
did i make an end of them in the wilder 

20 18 but i said unto their child in the wilder walk ye not in 
the statut of your father neither observ their judgment nor 
defil yourselv with their idol 20 19 i am the lord your god walk 
in my statut and keep my judgment and do them 20 20 and hallow 
my sabbath and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may 
know that i am the lord your god 

20 21 notwithstand the child rebel against me they walk 
not in my statut neither kept my judgment to do them which if a 
man do he shall even live in them they pollut my sabbath then i 
said i would pour out my furi upon them to accomplish my anger 
against them in the wilder 

20 22 nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my name s 
sake that it should not be pollut in the sight of the heathen in 
whose sight i brought them forth 

20 23 i lift up mine hand unto them also in the wilder that i 
would scatter them among the heathen and disper them through the 
countri 20 24 becau they had not execut my judgment but had 
despi my statut and had pollut my sabbath and their eye 
were after their father idol 

20 25 wherefor i gave them also statut that were not good and 
judgment wherebi they should not live 20 26 and i pollut them in 
their own gift in that they cau to pa through the fire all that 
openeth the womb that i might make them desol to the end that 
they might know that i am the lord 

20 27 therefor son of man speak unto the hou of israel and say 
unto them thu saith the lord god yet in thi your father have 
blasphem me in that they have commit a trespass against me 

20 28 for when i had brought them into the land for the which i 
lift up mine hand to give it to them then they saw everi high hill 
and all the thick tree and they offer there their sacrif and 
there they present the provoc of their offer there also 
they made their sweet savour and pour out there their drink 
offer 

20 29 then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go 
and the name whereof is call bamah unto thi day 

20 30 wherefor say unto the hou of israel thu saith the lord god 
are ye pollut after the manner of your father and commit ye 
whoredom after their abomin 20 31 for when ye offer your 
gift when ye make your son to pa through the fire ye pollut 
yourselv with all your idol even unto thi day and shall i be 
enquir of by you o hou of israel a i live saith the lord god 
i will not be enquir of by you 

20 32 and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that 
ye say we will be a the heathen a the famili of the countri 
to serv wood and stone 

20 33 a i live saith the lord god sure with a mighti hand and 
with a stretch out arm and with furi pour out will i rule over 
you 20 34 and i will bring you out from the peopl and will gather 
you out of the countri wherein ye are scatter with a mighti hand 
and with a stretch out arm and with furi pour out 

20 35 and i will bring you into the wilder of the peopl and 
there will i plead with you face to face 

20 36 like a i plead with your father in the wilder of the 
land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god 

20 37 and i will cau you to pa under the rod and i will bring you 
into the bond of the coven 20 38 and i will purg out from among 
you the rebel and them that transgress against me i will bring them 
forth out of the countri where they sojourn and they shall not enter 
into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord 

20 39 a for you o hou of israel thu saith the lord god go ye

hand 

33 9 nevertheless if thou warn the wick of hi way to turn from it 
if he do not turn from hi way he shall die in hi iniqu but thou 
hast deliv thi soul 

33 10 therefor o thou son of man speak unto the hou of israel 
thu ye speak say if our transgress and our sin be upon u

thi peopl the righteou of the righteou shall not deliv him 
in the day of hi transgress a for the wick of the wick 
he shall not fall therebi in the day that he turneth from hi 
wick neither shall the righteou be abl to live for hi 
righteou in the day that he sinneth 

33 13 when i shall say to the righteou that he shall sure live if 
he trust to hi own righteou and commit iniqu all hi 
righteou shall not be rememb but for hi iniqu that he 
hath commit he shall die for it 

33 14 again when i say unto the wick thou shalt sure die if he

wick restor the pledg give again that he had rob walk in the 
statut of life without commit iniqu he shall sure live 
he shall not die 

33 16 none of hi sin that he hath commit shall be mention unto 
him he hath done that which is law and right he shall sure 
live 

33 17 yet the child of thi peopl say the way of the lord is not 
equal but a for them their way is not equal 

33 18 when the righteou turneth from hi righteou and 
committeth iniqu he shall even die therebi 

33 19 but if the wick turn from hi wick and do that which is

say abraham wa one and he inherit the land but we are mani 
the land is given u for inherit 

33 25 wherefor say unto them thu saith the lord god ye eat with

33 28 for i will lay the land most desol and the pomp of her 
strength shall cea and the mountain of israel shall be desol 
that none shall pa through

34 1 and the word of the lord came unto me say 34 2 son of man 
prophesi against the shepherd of israel prophesi and say unto them 
thu saith the lord god unto the shepherd woe be to the shepherd of 
israel that do feed themselv should not the shepherd feed the 
flock 34 3 ye eat the fat and ye cloth you with the wool ye kill 
them that are fed but ye feed not the flock 

34 4 the disea have ye not strengthen neither have ye heal 
that which wa sick neither have ye bound up that which wa broken 
neither have ye brought again that which wa driven away neither have 
ye sought that which wa lost but with forc and with cruelti have ye 
rule them 

34 5 and they were scatter becau there is no shepherd and they 
becam meat to all the beast of the field when they were scatter 

34 6 my sheep wander through all the mountain and upon everi high 
hill yea my flock wa scatter upon all the face of the earth and 
none did search or seek after them 

34 7 therefor ye shepherd hear the word of the lord 34 8 a i 
live saith the lord god sure becau my flock becam a prey and 
my flock becam meat to everi beast of the field becau there wa no 
shepherd neither did my shepherd search for my flock but the 
shepherd fed themselv and fed not my flock 34 9 therefor o ye 
shepherd hear the word of the lord 34 10 thu saith the lord god 
behold i am against the shepherd and i will requir my flock at 
their hand and cau them to cea from feed the flock neither 
shall the shepherd feed themselv ani more for i will deliv my 
flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them 

34 11 for thu saith the lord god behold i even i will both search 
my sheep and seek them out 

34 12 a a shepherd seeketh out hi flock in the day that he is among 
hi sheep that are scatter so will i seek out my sheep and will 
deliv them out of all place where they have been scatter in the 
cloudi and dark day 

34 13 and i will bring them out from the peopl and gather them from 
the countri and will bring them to their own land and feed them 
upon the mountain of israel by the river and in all the inhabit 
place of the countri 

34 14 i will feed them in a good pastur and upon the high mountain 
of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold 
and in a fat pastur shall they feed upon the mountain of israel 

34 15 i will feed my flock and i will cau them to lie down saith 
the lord god 

34 16 i will seek that which wa lost and bring again that which wa 
driven away and will bind up that which wa broken and will 
strengthen that which wa sick but i will destroy the fat and the 
strong i will feed them with judgment 

34 17 and a for you o my flock thu saith the lord god behold i 
judg between cattl and cattl between the ram and the he goat 

34 18 seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good 
pastur but ye must tread down with your foot the residu of your 
pastur and to have drunk of the deep water but ye must foul the 
residu with your foot 34 19 and a for my flock they eat that 
which ye have trodden with your foot and they drink that which ye 
have foul with your foot 

34 20 therefor thu saith the lord god unto them behold i even i 
will judg between the fat cattl and between the lean cattl

prey and i will judg between cattl and cattl

yoke and deliv them out of the hand of those that serv 
themselv of them 

34 28 and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall 
the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safe and

broken to piec togeth and becam like the chaff of the summer 
threshingfloor and the wind carri them away that no place wa 
found for them and the stone that smote the imag becam a great

2 39 and after thee shall ari anoth kingdom inferior to thee and 
anoth third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the 
earth 

2 40 and the fourth kingdom shall be strong a iron forasmuch a iron 
breaketh in piec and subdueth all thing and a iron that breaketh

7 28 hitherto is the end of the matter a for me daniel my

in a vision and i wa by the river of ulai 

8 3 then i lift up mine eye and saw and behold there stood 
befor the river a ram which had two horn and the two horn were 
high but one wa higher than the other and the higher came up last 

8 4 i saw the ram push westward and northward and southward so 
that no beast might stand befor him neither wa there ani that 
could deliv out of hi hand but he did accord to hi will and 
becam great 

8 5 and a i wa consid behold an he goat came from the west on 
the face of the whole earth and touch not the ground and the goat 
had a notabl horn between hi eye 

8 6 and he came to the ram that had two horn which i had seen 
stand befor the river and ran unto him in the furi of hi power 

8 7 and i saw him come close unto the ram and he wa move with 
choler against him and smote the ram and brake hi two horn and 
there wa no power in the ram to stand befor him but he cast him 
down to the ground and stamp upon him and there wa none that 
could deliv the ram out of hi hand 

8 8 therefor the he goat wax veri great and when he wa strong 
the great horn wa broken and for it came up four notabl one toward 
the four wind of heaven 

8 9 and out of one of them came forth a littl horn which wax 
exceed great toward the south and toward the east and toward the 
pleasant land 

8 10 and it wax great even to the host of heaven and it cast down 
some of the host and of the star to the ground and stamp upon 
them 

8 11 yea he magnifi himself even to the princ of the host and by 
him the daili sacrif wa taken away and the place of the sanctuari 
wa cast down 

8 12 and an host wa given him against the daili sacrif by reason 
of transgress and it cast down the truth to the ground and it

11 2 and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up 
yet three king in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than

11 3 and a mighti king shall stand up that shall rule with great 
dominion and do accord to hi will 

11 4 and when he shall stand up hi kingdom shall be broken and 
shall be divid toward the four wind of heaven and not to hi 
poster nor accord to hi dominion which he rule for hi 
kingdom shall be pluck up even for other besid those 

11 5 and the king of the south shall be strong and one of hi

11 6 and in the end of year they shall join themselv togeth for 
the king s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north 
to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm 
neither shall he stand nor hi arm but she shall be given up and 
they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthen

11 7 but out of a branch of her root shall one stand up in hi 
estat which shall come with an armi and shall enter into the 
fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and 
shall prevail 11 8 and shall also carri captiv into egypt their 
god with their princ and with their preciou vessel of silver 
and of gold and he shall continu more year than the king of the 
north 

11 9 so the king of the south shall come into hi kingdom and shall 
return into hi own land 

11 10 but hi son shall be stir up and shall assembl a multitud 
of great forc and one shall certainli come and overflow and pa 
through then shall he return and be stir up even to hi

11 11 and the king of the south shall be move with choler and shall 
come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he 
shall set forth a great multitud but the multitud shall be given 
into hi hand 

11 12 and when he hath taken away the multitud hi heart shall be 
lift up and he shall cast down mani ten thousand but he shall not 
be strengthen by it 

11 13 for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a 
multitud greater than the former and shall certainli come after 
certain year with a great armi and with much rich 

11 14 and in those time there shall mani stand up against the king of 
the south also the robber of thi peopl shall exalt themselv to

11 15 so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and 
take the most fenc citi and the arm of the south shall not 
withstand neither hi chosen peopl neither shall there be ani 
strength to withstand 

11 16 but he that cometh against him shall do accord to hi own

mani but a princ for hi own behalf shall cau the reproach offer 
by him to cea without hi own reproach he shall cau it to turn 
upon him 

11 19 then he shall turn hi face toward the fort of hi own land but 
he shall stumbl and fall and not be found 

11 20 then shall stand up in hi estat a raiser of tax in the glori 
of the kingdom but within few day he shall be destroy neither in 
anger nor in battl 

11 21 and in hi estat shall stand up a vile person to whom they 
shall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come in 
peaceabl and obtain the kingdom by flatteri 

11 22 and with the arm of a flood shall they be overflown from befor

11 23 and after the leagu made with him he shall work deceit 
for he shall come up and shall becom strong with a small peopl

11 25 and he shall stir up hi power and hi courag against the king 
of the south with a great armi and the king of the south shall be 
stir up to battl with a veri great and mighti armi but he shall 
not stand for they shall forecast devic against him 

11 26 yea they that feed of the portion of hi meat shall destroy 
him and hi armi shall overflow and mani shall fall down slain 

11 27 and both of these king heart shall be to do mischief and 
they shall speak lie at one tabl but it shall not prosper for yet 
the end shall be at the time appoint 

11 28 then shall he return into hi land with great rich and hi 
heart shall be against the holi coven and he shall do exploit 
and return to hi own land 

11 29 at the time appoint he shall return and come toward the 
south but it shall not be a the former or a the latter 

11 30 for the ship of chittim shall come against him therefor he 
shall be griev and return and have indign against the holi 
coven so shall he do he shall even return and have intellig 
with them that forsak the holi coven 

11 31 and arm shall stand on hi part and they shall pollut the 
sanctuari of strength and shall take away the daili sacrif and 
they shall place the abomin that maketh desol 

11 32 and such a do wickedli against the coven shall he corrupt by

11 33 and they that understand among the peopl shall instruct mani 
yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captiv and by 
spoil mani day 

11 34 now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a littl 
help but mani shall cleav to them with flatteri 

11 35 and some of them of understand shall fall to tri them and 
to purg and to make them white even to the time of the end becau 
it is yet for a time appoint 

11 36 and the king shall do accord to hi will and he shall exalt 
himself and magnifi himself abov everi god and shall speak 
marvel thing against the god of god and shall prosper till the 
indign be accomplish for that that is determin shall be 
done 

11 37 neither shall he regard the god of hi father nor the desir 
of woman nor regard ani god for he shall magnifi himself abov all 

11 38 but in hi estat shall he honour the god of forc and a god 
whom hi father knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and 
with preciou stone and pleasant thing 

11 39 thu shall he do in the most strong hold with a strang god 
whom he shall acknowledg and increa with glori and he shall cau 
them to rule over mani and shall divid the land for gain 

11 40 and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at 
him and the king of the north shall come against him like a 
whirlwind with chariot and with horseman and with mani ship and 
he shall enter into the countri and shall overflow and pa over 

11 41 he shall enter also into the gloriou land and mani countri 
shall be overthrown but these shall escap out of hi hand even 
edom and moab and the chief of the child of ammon 

11 42 he shall stretch forth hi hand also upon the countri and the 
land of egypt shall not escap 

11 43 but he shall have power over the treasur of gold and of 
silver and over all the preciou thing of egypt and the libyan and 
the ethiopian shall be at hi step 

11 44 but tide out of the east and out of the north shall troubl 
him therefor he shall go forth with great furi to destroy and 
utterli to make away mani 

11 45 and he shall plant the tabernacl of hi palac between the 
sea in the gloriou holi mountain yet he shall come to hi end and 
none shall help him 

12 1 and at that time shall michael stand up the great princ which 
standeth for the child of thi peopl and there shall be a time of 
troubl such a never wa sinc there wa a nation even to that same 
time and at that time thi peopl shall be deliv everi one that 
shall be found written in the book 

12 2 and mani of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awak 
some to everlast life and some to shame and everlast contempt 

12 3 and they that be wise shall shine a the bright of the 
firmament and they that turn mani to righteou a the star for

thousand two hundr and nineti day 

12 12 bless is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three 
hundr and five and thirti day

and stand in thi lot at the end of the day 




hosea 


1 1 the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri in

to hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredom and child of 
whoredom for the land hath commit great whoredom depart from

1 3 so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim which 
conceiv and bare him a son 

1 4 and the lord said unto him call hi name jezreel for yet a 
littl while and i will aveng the blood of jezreel upon the hou of

1 5 and it shall come to pa at that day that i will break the bow 
of israel in the valley of jezreel 

1 6 and she conceiv again and bare a daughter and god said unto 
him call her name loruhamah for i will no more have merci upon the 
hou of israel but i will utterli take them away 

1 7 but i will have merci upon the hou of judah and will save them 
by the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword 
nor by battl by hor nor by horseman 

1 8 now when she had wean loruhamah she conceiv and bare a son 

1 9 then said god call hi name loammi for ye are not my peopl and 
i will not be your god 

1 10 yet the number of the child of israel shall be a the sand of 
the sea which cannot be measur nor number and it shall come to 
pa that in the place where it wa said unto them ye are not my 
peopl there it shall be said unto them ye are the son of the 
live god 

1 11 then shall the child of judah and the child of israel be 
gather togeth and appoint themselv one head and they shall 
come up out of the land for great shall be the day of jezreel

a a wilder and set her like a dri land and slay her with 
thirst 

2 4 and i will not have merci upon her child for they be the

said these are my reward that my lover have given me and i will 
make them a forest and the beast of the field shall eat them 

2 13 and i will visit upon her the day of baalim wherein she burn 
incen to them and she deck herself with her ear and her 
jewel and she went after her lover and forgat me saith the lord 

2 14 therefor behold i will allur her and bring her into the 
wilder and speak comfort unto her 

2 15 and i will give her her vineyard from thenc and the valley of 
achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there a in the day of 
her youth and a in the day when she came up out of the land of 
egypt 

2 16 and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call 
me ishi and shalt call me no more baali 

2 17 for i will take away the name of baalim out of her mouth and 
they shall no more be rememb by their name 

2 18 and in that day will i make a coven for them with the beast 
of the field and with the fowl of heaven and with the creep 
thing of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the 
battl out of the earth and will make them to lie down safe 

2 19 and i will betroth thee unto me for ever yea i will betroth 
thee unto me in righteou and in judgment and in lovingkind 
and in merci 

2 20 i will even betroth thee unto me in faith and thou shalt 
know the lord 

2 21 and it shall come to pa in that day i will hear saith the 
lord i will hear the heaven and they shall hear the earth 2 22 and 
the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they 
shall hear jezreel 

2 23 and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have merci 
upon her that had not obtain merci and i will say to them which 
were not my peopl thou art my peopl and they shall say thou art 
my god 

3 1 then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman belov of her 
friend yet an adulteress accord to the love of the lord toward 
the child of israel who look to other god and love flagon of 
wine 

3 2 so i bought her to me for fifteen piec of silver and for an 
homer of barley and an half homer of barley 3 3 and i said unto her 
thou shalt abid for me mani day thou shalt not play the harlot and 
thou shalt not be for anoth man so will i also be for thee 

3 4 for the child of israel shall abid mani day without a king 
and without a princ and without a sacrif and without an imag 
and without an ephod and without teraphim 3 5 afterward shall the 
child of israel return and seek the lord their god and david 
their king and shall fear the lord and hi good in the latter 
day 

4 1 hear the word of the lord ye child of israel for the lord 
hath a controversi with the inhabit of the land becau there is 
no truth nor merci nor knowledg of god in the land 

4 2 by swear and lie and kill and steal and commit 
adulteri they break out and blood toucheth blood 

4 3 therefor shall the land mourn and everi one that dwelleth 
therein shall languish with the beast of the field and with the 
fowl of heaven yea the fish of the sea also shall be taken away 

4 4 yet let no man strive nor reprov anoth for thi peopl are a 
they that strive with the priest 

4 5 therefor shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall 
fall with thee in the night and i will destroy thi mother 

4 6 my peopl are destroy for lack of knowledg becau thou hast 
reject knowledg i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no 
priest to me see thou hast forgotten the law of thi god i will 
also forget thi child 

4 7 a they were increa so they sin against me therefor will 
i chang their glori into shame 

4 8 they eat up the sin of my peopl and they set their heart on 
their iniqu 

4 9 and there shall be like peopl like priest and i will punish 
them for their way and reward them their do 

4 10 for they shall eat and not have enough they shall commit 
whoredom and shall not increa becau they have left off to take 
heed to the lord 

4 11 whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart 

4 12 my peopl ask counsel at their stock and their staff declareth 
unto them for the spirit of whoredom hath cau them to err and 
they have gone a whore from under their god 

4 13 they sacrif upon the top of the mountain and burn incen 
upon the hill under oak and poplar and elm becau the shadow 
thereof is good therefor your daughter shall commit whoredom and 
your spou shall commit adulteri 

4 14 i will not punish your daughter when they commit whoredom nor 
your spou when they commit adulteri for themselv are separ 
with whore and they sacrif with harlot therefor the peopl 
that doth not understand shall fall 

4 15 though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend 
and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear 
the lord liveth 

4 16 for israel slideth back a a backslid heifer now the lord 
will feed them a a lamb in a larg place 

4 17 ephraim is join to idol let him alon 

4 18 their drink is sour they have commit whoredom continu 
her ruler with shame do love give ye 

4 19 the wind hath bound her up in her wing and they shall be 
asham becau of their sacrif 

5 1 hear ye thi o priest and hearken ye hou of israel and give 
ye ear o hou of the king for judgment is toward you becau ye 
have been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor 

5 2 and the revolt are profound to make slaughter though i have 
been a rebuk of them all 

5 3 i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraim 
thou committest whoredom and israel is defil 

5 4 they will not frame their do to turn unto their god for the 
spirit of whoredom is in the midst of them and they have not known 
the lord 

5 5 and the pride of israel doth testifi to hi face therefor shall 
israel and ephraim fall in their iniqu judah also shall fall with 
them 

5 6 they shall go with their flock and with their herd to seek the 
lord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from 
them 

5 7 they have dealt treacher against the lord for they have 
begotten strang child now shall a month devour them with their 
portion 

5 8 blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cri aloud 
at bethaven after thee o benjamin 

5 9 ephraim shall be desol in the day of rebuk among the tribe 
of israel have i made known that which shall sure be 

5 10 the princ of judah were like them that remov the bound 
therefor i will pour out my wrath upon them like water 

5 11 ephraim is oppress and broken in judgment becau he willingli 
walk after the command 

5 12 therefor will i be unto ephraim a a moth and to the hou of 
judah a rotten 

5 13 when ephraim saw hi sick and judah saw hi wound then went 
ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not heal 
you nor cure you of your wound 

5 14 for i will be unto ephraim a a lion and a a young lion to the 
hou of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take away 
and none shall rescu him 

5 15 i will go and return to my place till they acknowledg their 
offenc and seek my face in their afflict they will seek me 
earli 

6 1 come and let u return unto the lord for he hath torn and he 
will heal u he hath smitten and he will bind u up 

6 2 after two day will he reviv u in the third day he will rai 
u up and we shall live in hi sight 

6 3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord hi go 
forth is prepar a the morn and he shall come unto u a the 
rain a the latter and former rain unto the earth 

6 4 o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do 
unto thee for your good is a a morn cloud and a the earli 
dew it goeth away 

6 5 therefor have i hew them by the prophet i have slain them by 
the word of my mouth and thi judgment are a the light that goeth 
forth 

6 6 for i desir merci and not sacrif and the knowledg of god 
more than burnt offer 

6 7 but they like men have transgress the coven there have they 
dealt treacher against me 

6 8 gilead is a citi of them that work iniqu and is pollut with 
blood 

6 9 and a troop of robber wait for a man so the compani of priest 
murder in the way by consent for they commit lewd 

6 10 i have seen an horribl thing in the hou of israel there is 
the whoredom of ephraim israel is defil 

6 11 also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i return 
the captiv of my peopl 

7 1 when i would have heal israel then the iniqu of ephraim wa 
discov and the wick of samaria for they commit falsehood 
and the thief cometh in and the troop of robber spoileth without 

7 2 and they consid not in their heart that i rememb all their 
wick now their own do have beset them about they are 
befor my face 

7 3 they make the king glad with their wick and the princ 
with their lie 

7 4 they are all adult a an oven heat by the baker who 
ceaseth from rai after he hath knead the dough until it be 
leaven 

7 5 in the day of our king the princ have made him sick with bottl 
of wine he stretch out hi hand with scorner 

7 6 for they have made readi their heart like an oven while they lie 
in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morn it burneth 
a a flame fire 

7 7 they are all hot a an oven and have devour their judg all 
their king are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me 

7 8 ephraim he hath mix himself among the peopl ephraim is a cake 
not turn 

7 9 stranger have devour hi strength and he knoweth it not yea 
gray hair are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not 

7 10 and the pride of israel testifieth to hi face and they do not 
return to the lord their god nor seek him for all thi 

7 11 ephraim also is like a silli dove without heart they call to 
egypt they go to assyria 

7 12 when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bring 
them down a the fowl of the heaven i will chasti them a their 
congreg hath heard 

7 13 woe unto them for they have fled from me destruct unto them 
becau they have transgress against me though i have redeem 
them yet they have spoken lie against me 

7 14 and they have not cri unto me with their heart when they 
howl upon their bed they assembl themselv for corn and wine 
and they rebel against me 

7 15 though i have bound and strengthen their arm yet do they 
imagin mischief against me 

7 16 they return but not to the most high they are like a deceit 
bow their princ shall fall by the sword for the rage of their 
tongu thi shall be their deri in the land of egypt 

8 1 set the trumpet to thi mouth he shall come a an eagl against 
the hou of the lord becau they have transgress my coven and 
trespass against my law 

8 2 israel shall cri unto me my god we know thee 

8 3 israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemi shall 
pursu him 

8 4 they have set up king but not by me they have made princ and 
i knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them 
idol that they may be cut off 

8 5 thi calf o samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindl 
against them how long will it be ere they attain to innoc 8 6 
for from israel wa it also the workman made it therefor it is not 
god but the calf of samaria shall be broken in piec 

8 7 for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it 
hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the 
stranger shall swallow it up 

8 8 israel is swallow up now shall they be among the gentil a a 
vessel wherein is no pleasur 

8 9 for they are gone up to assyria a wild a alon by himself 
ephraim hath hire lover 

8 10 yea though they have hire among the nation now will i gather 
them and they shall sorrow a littl for the burden of the king of 
princ 

8 11 becau ephraim hath made mani altar to sin altar shall be 
unto him to sin 

8 12 i have written to him the great thing of my law but they were 
count a a strang thing 

8 13 they sacrif flesh for the sacrif of mine offer and 
eat it but the lord accepteth them not now will he rememb their 
iniqu and visit their sin they shall return to egypt 

8 14 for israel hath forgotten hi maker and buildeth templ and

bethel shall come to nought 

5 6 seek the lord and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in 
the hou of joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in 
bethel 

5 7 ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leav off righteou in 
the earth 5 8 seek him that maketh the seven star and orion and 
turneth the shadow of death into the morn and maketh the day dark 
with night that calleth for the water of the sea and poureth them 
out upon the face of the earth the lord is hi name 5 9 that 
strengtheneth the spoil against the strong so that the spoil 
shall come against the fortress 

5 10 they hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that 
speaketh uprightli 

5 11 forasmuch therefor a your tread is upon the poor and ye 
take from him burden of wheat ye have built hou of hewn stone 
but ye shall not dwell in them ye have plant pleasant vineyard 
but ye shall not drink wine of them 

5 12 for i know your manifold transgress and your mighti sin 
they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn asid the poor 
in the gate from their right 

5 13 therefor the prudent shall keep silenc in that time for it is 
an evil time 

5 14 seek good and not evil that ye may live and so the lord the 
god of host shall be with you a ye have spoken 

5 15 hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the 
gate it may be that the lord god of host will be graciou unto the 
remnant of joseph

into the hou and lean hi hand on the wall and a serpent bit 
him 

5 20 shall not the day of the lord be dark and not light even 
veri dark and no bright in it 5 21 i hate i despi your feast 
day and i will not smell in your solemn assembl 

5 22 though ye offer me burnt offer and your meat offer i 
will not accept them neither will i regard the peac offer of 
your fat beast 

5 23 take thou away from me the noi of thi song for i will not 
hear the melodi of thi viol 

5 24 but let judgment run down a water and righteou a a 
mighti stream 

5 25 have ye offer unto me sacrif and offer in the 
wilder forti year o hou of israel 5 26 but ye have born the 
tabernacl of your moloch and chiun your imag the star of your god 
which ye made to yourselv

saith the lord whose name is the god of host 

6 1 woe to them that are at ea in zion and trust in the mountain of 
samaria which are name chief of the nation to whom the hou of

6 3 ye that put far away the evil day and cau the seat of violenc 
to come near 6 4 that lie upon bed of ivori and stretch themselv 
upon their couch and eat the lamb out of the flock and the calf 
out of the midst of the stall 6 5 that chant to the sound of the 
viol and invent to themselv instrument of musick like david 6 6 
that drink wine in bowl and anoint themselv with the chief 
ointment but they are not griev for the afflict of joseph 

6 7 therefor now shall they go captiv with the first that go 
captiv and the banquet of them that stretch themselv shall be 
remov 

6 8 the lord god hath sworn by himself saith the lord the god of 
host i abhor the excel of jacob and hate hi palac 
therefor will i deliv up the citi with all that is therein 

6 9 and it shall come to pa if there remain ten men in one hou 
that they shall die 

6 10 and a man s uncl shall take him up and he that burneth him to 
bring out the bone out of the hou and shall say unto him that is 
by the side of the hou is there yet ani with thee and he shall 
say no then shall he say hold thi tongu for we may not make 
mention of the name of the lord 

6 11 for behold the lord commandeth and he will smite the great 
hou with breach and the littl hou with cleft 

6 12 shall hor run upon the rock will one plow there with ox 
for ye have turn judgment into gall and the fruit of righteou 
into hemlock 6 13 ye which rejoic in a thing of nought which say 
have we not taken to u horn by our own strength 6 14 but behold 
i will rai up against you a nation o hou of israel saith the 
lord the god of host and they shall afflict you from the enter in

7 8 and the lord said unto me amo what seest thou and i said a 
plumblin then said the lord behold i will set a plumblin in the 
midst of my peopl israel i will not again pa by them ani more 7 9 
and the high place of isaac shall be desol and the sanctuari of 
israel shall be laid wast and i will rise against the hou of 
jeroboam with the sword 

7 10 then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of 
israel say amo hath conspir against thee in the midst of the 
hou of israel the land is not abl to bear all hi word 

7 11 for thu amo saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel

7 12 also amaziah said unto amo o thou seer go flee thee away into 
the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesi there 7 13 but

and it is the king s court

neither wa i a prophet s son but i wa an herdman and a gather of 
sycomor fruit 7 15 and the lord took me a i follow the flock and 
the lord said unto me go prophesi unto my peopl israel 

7 16 now therefor hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest 
prophesi not against israel and drop not thi word against the hou

7 17 therefor thu saith the lord thi wife shall be an harlot in the 
citi and thi son and thi daughter shall fall by the sword and thi 
land shall be divid by line and thou shalt die in a pollut land 
and israel shall sure go into captiv forth of hi land 

8 1 thu hath the lord god shew unto me and behold a basket of 
summer fruit 

8 2 and he said amo what seest thou and i said a basket of summer 
fruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my peopl of 
israel i will not again pa by them ani more 

8 3 and the song of the templ shall be howl in that day saith 
the lord god there shall be mani dead bodi in everi place they 
shall cast them forth with silenc 

8 4 hear thi o ye that swallow up the needi even to make the poor 
of the land to fail 8 5 say when will the new moon be gone that 
we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat make 
the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifi the balanc by 
deceit 8 6 that we may buy the poor for silver and the needi for a 
pair of shoe yea and sell the refu of the wheat 8 7 the lord 
hath sworn by the excel of jacob sure i will never forget ani 
of their work 

8 8 shall not the land trembl for thi and everi one mourn that 
dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholli a a flood and it shall 
be cast out and drown a by the flood of egypt 

8 9 and it shall come to pa in that day saith the lord god that i 
will cau the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in

mourn of an onli son and the end thereof a a bitter day 

8 11 behold the day come saith the lord god that i will send a 
famin in the land not a famin of bread nor a thirst for water but 
of hear the word of the lord 8 12 and they shall wander from sea 
to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro 
to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it 

8 13 in that day shall the fair virgin and young men faint for 
thirst 

8 14 they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thi god o dan 
liveth and the manner of beersheba liveth even they shall fall and 
never rise up again 

9 1 i saw the lord stand upon the altar and he said smite the 
lintel of the door that the post may shake and cut them in the 
head all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword he 
that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them 
shall not be deliv 

9 2 though they dig into hell thenc shall mine hand take them 
though they climb up to heaven thenc will i bring them down 9 3 and 
though they hide themselv in the top of carmel i will search and 
take them out thenc and though they be hid from my sight in the 
bottom of the sea thenc will i command the serpent and he shall 
bite them 9 4 and though they go into captiv befor their enemi 
thenc will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i will 
set mine eye upon them for evil and not for good 

9 5 and the lord god of host is he that toucheth the land and it 
shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise 
up wholli like a flood and shall be drown a by the flood of 
egypt 

9 6 it is he that buildeth hi stori in the heaven and hath found 
hi troop in the earth he that calleth for the water of the sea and 
poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is hi name 

9 7 are ye not a child of the ethiopian unto me o child of 
israel saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the land 
of egypt and the philistin from caphtor and the syrian from kir 
9 8 behold the eye of the lord god are upon the sin kingdom and

9 9 for lo i will command and i will sift the hou of israel among 
all nation like a corn is sift in a siev yet shall not the 
least grain fall upon the earth 

9 10 all the sinner of my peopl shall die by the sword which say

9 11 in that day will i rai up the tabernacl of david that is 
fallen and close up the breach thereof and i will rai up hi

1 12 and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the 
sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sake 
thi great tempest is upon you 

1 13 nevertheless the men row hard to bring it to the land but they 
could not for the sea wrought and wa tempestu against them 

1 14 wherefor they cri unto the lord and said we beseech thee o 
lord we beseech thee let u not perish for thi man s life and lay 
not upon u innoc blood for thou o lord hast done a it plea

1 15 so they look up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the 
sea cea from her rage 

1 16 then the men fear the lord exceedingli and offer a sacrif 
unto the lord and made vow 

1 17 now the lord had prepar a great fish to swallow up jonah and 
jonah wa in the belli of the fish three day and three night 

2 1 then jonah pray unto the lord hi god out of the fish s belli 
2 2 and said i cri by reason of mine afflict unto the lord and

3 9 who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from hi 
fierc anger that we perish not 3 10 and god saw their work that 
they turn from their evil way and god repent of the evil that he 
had said that he would do unto them and he did it not

befor unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a graciou god and 
merci slow to anger and of great kind and repentest thee of 
the evil 

4 3 therefor now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me for 
it is better for me to die than to live 

4 4 then said the lord doest thou well to be angri 4 5 so jonah 
went out of the citi and sat on the east side of the citi and there 
made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see 
what would becom of the citi 

4 6 and the lord god prepar a gourd and made it to come up over 
jonah that it might be a shadow over hi head to deliv him from

magnifi from the border of israel 

1 6 a son honoureth hi father and a servant hi master if then i be 
a father where is mine honour and if i be a master where is my 
fear saith the lord of host unto you o priest that despi my 
name and ye say wherein have we despi thi name 1 7 ye offer 
pollut bread upon mine altar and ye say wherein have we pollut 
thee in that ye say the tabl of the lord is contempt 

1 8 and if ye offer the blind for sacrif is it not evil and if ye 
offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thi 
governor will he be plea with thee or accept thi person saith 
the lord of host 

1 9 and now i pray you beseech god that he will be graciou unto u

lord of host 

1 10 who is there even among you that would shut the door for nought 
neither do ye kindl fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasur 
in you saith the lord of host neither will i accept an offer at 
your hand 

1 11 for from the rise of the sun even unto the go down of the 
same my name shall be great among the gentil and in everi place 
incen shall be offer unto my name and a pure offer for my 
name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of host 

1 12 but ye have profan it in that ye say the tabl of the lord is 
pollut and the fruit thereof even hi meat is contempt 

1 13 ye said also behold what a weari is it and ye have snuf 
at it saith the lord of host and ye brought that which wa torn 
and the lame and the sick thu ye brought an offer should i 
accept thi of your hand saith the lord 

1 14 but cur be the deceiv which hath in hi flock a male and 
voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing for i am a 
great king saith the lord of host and my name is dread among the 
heathen 

2 1 and now o ye priest thi command is for you 

2 2 if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give 
glori unto my name saith the lord of host i will even send a cur 
upon you and i will cur your bless yea i have cur them 
alreadi becau ye do not lay it to heart 

2 3 behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your face 
even the dung of your solemn feast and one shall take you away with 
it 

2 4 and ye shall know that i have sent thi command unto you that 
my coven might be with levi saith the lord of host 

2 5 my coven wa with him of life and peac and i gave them to him 
for the fear wherewith he fear me and wa afraid befor my name 

2 6 the law of truth wa in hi mouth and iniqu wa not found in 
hi lip he walk with me in peac and equiti and did turn mani 
away from iniqu 

2 7 for the priest s lip should keep knowledg and they should seek 
the law at hi mouth for he is the messeng of the lord of host 

2 8 but ye are depart out of the way ye have cau mani to stumbl 
at the law ye have corrupt the coven of levi saith the lord of 
host 

2 9 therefor have i also made you contempt and base befor all 
the peopl accord a ye have not kept my way but have been 
partial in the law 

2 10 have we not all one father hath not one god creat u whi do 
we deal treacher everi man against hi brother by profan the 
coven of our father 2 11 judah hath dealt treacher and an 
abomin is commit in israel and in jerusalem for judah hath 
profan the holi of the lord which he love and hath marri the 
daughter of a strang god 

2 12 the lord will cut off the man that doeth thi the master and the 
scholar out of the tabernacl of jacob and him that offereth an 
offer unto the lord of host 

2 13 and thi have ye done again cover the altar of the lord with 
tear with weep and with cri out insomuch that he regardeth 
not the offer ani more or receiveth it with good will at your 
hand 

2 14 yet ye say wherefor becau the lord hath been wit between 
thee and the wife of thi youth against whom thou hast dealt 
treacher yet is she thi companion and the wife of thi coven 

2 15 and did not he make one yet had he the residu of the spirit 
and wherefor one that he might seek a godli seed therefor take 
heed to your spirit and let none deal treacher against the wife 
of hi youth 

2 16 for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth put 
away for one covereth violenc with hi garment saith the lord of 
host therefor take heed to your spirit that ye deal not 
treacher 

2 17 ye have weari the lord with your word yet ye say wherein 
have we weari him when ye say everi one that doeth evil is good in 
the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god 
of judgment 3 1 behold i will send my messeng and he shall 
prepar the way befor me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenli 
come to hi templ even the messeng of the coven whom ye 
delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of host 

3 2 but who may abid the day of hi come and who shall stand when 
he appeareth for he is like a refin s fire and like fuller soap 
3 3 and he shall sit a a refin and purifi of silver and he shall 
purifi the son of levi and purg them a gold and silver that they 
may offer unto the lord an offer in righteou 

3 4 then shall the offer of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto 
the lord a in the day of old and a in former year 

3 5 and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift 
wit against the sorcer and against the adult and against 
fal swearer and against those that oppress the hirel in hi 
wage the widow and the fatherless and that turn asid the stranger 
from hi right and fear not me saith the lord of host 

3 6 for i am the lord i chang not therefor ye son of jacob are 
not consum 

3 7 even from the day of your father ye are gone away from mine 
ordin and have not kept them return unto me and i will return 
unto you saith the lord of host but ye said wherein shall we 
return 3 8 will a man rob god yet ye have rob me but ye say 
wherein have we rob thee in tith and offer 

3 9 ye are cur with a cur for ye have rob me even thi whole 
nation 

3 10 bring ye all the tith into the storeh that there may be 
meat in mine hou and prove me now herewith saith the lord of 
host if i will not open you the window of heaven and pour you out 
a bless that there shall not be room enough to receiv it 

3 11 and i will rebuk the devour for your sake and he shall not 
destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your vine cast her 
fruit befor the time in the field saith the lord of host 

3 12 and all nation shall call you bless for ye shall be a 
delightsom land saith the lord of host 

3 13 your word have been stout against me saith the lord yet ye 
say what have we spoken so much against thee 3 14 ye have said it 
is vain to serv god and what profit is it that we have kept hi 
ordin and that we have walk mourn befor the lord of 
host 3 15 and now we call the proud happi yea they that work 
wick are set up yea they that tempt god are even deliv 

3 16 then they that fear the lord spake often one to anoth and 
the lord hearken and heard it and a book of remembr wa 
written befor him for them that fear the lord and that thought 
upon hi name 

3 17 and they shall be mine saith the lord of host in that day when 
i make up my jewel and i will spare them a a man spareth hi own 
son that serveth him 

3 18 then shall ye return and discern between the righteou and the 
wick between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not 

4 1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn a an oven and all 
the proud yea and all that do wickedli shall be stubbl and the 
day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of host that it 
shall leav them neither root nor branch 

4 2 but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteou 
ari with heal in hi wing and ye shall go forth and grow up a 
calf of the stall 

4 3 and ye shall tread down the wick for they shall be ash under

and shall teach men so he shall be call the least in the kingdom of 
heaven but whosoev shall do and teach them the same shall be 
call great in the kingdom of heaven 

5 20 for i say unto you that except your righteou shall exceed 
the righteou of the scribe and pharis ye shall in no case 
enter into the kingdom of heaven 

5 21 ye have heard that it wa said by them of old time thou shalt 
not kill and whosoev shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment 
5 22 but i say unto you that whosoev is angri with hi brother 
without a cau shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoev 
shall say to hi brother raca shall be in danger of the council but 
whosoev shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire 

5 23 therefor if thou bring thi gift to the altar and there 
rememberest that thi brother hath ought against thee 5 24 leav there 
thi gift befor the altar and go thi way first be reconcil to thi 
brother and then come and offer thi gift 

5 25 agr with thine adversari quickli while thou art in the way 
with him lest at ani time the adversari deliv thee to the judg 
and the judg deliv thee to the offic and thou be cast into 
prison 

5 26 verili i say unto thee thou shalt by no mean come out thenc 
till thou hast paid the uttermost farth 

5 27 ye have heard that it wa said by them of old time thou shalt 
not commit adulteri 5 28 but i say unto you that whosoev looketh 
on a woman to lust after her hath commit adulteri with her alreadi 
in hi heart 

5 29 and if thi right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from 
thee for it is profit for thee that one of thi member should 
perish and not that thi whole bodi should be cast into hell 

5 30 and if thi right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from 
thee for it is profit for thee that one of thi member should 
perish and not that thi whole bodi should be cast into hell 

5 31 it hath been said whosoev shall put away hi wife let him 
give her a write of divorc 5 32 but i say unto you that 
whosoev shall put away hi wife save for the cau of 
fornic causeth her to commit adulteri and whosoev shall marri 
her that is divorc committeth adulteri 

5 33 again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time 
thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine 
oath 5 34 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven 
for it is god s throne 5 35 nor by the earth for it is hi 
footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the citi of the great king 

5 36 neither shalt thou swear by thi head becau thou canst not make 
one hair white or black 

5 37 but let your commun be yea yea nay nay for whatsoev 
is more than these cometh of evil 

5 38 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a 
tooth for a tooth 5 39 but i say unto you that ye resist not evil 
but whosoev shall smite thee on thi right cheek turn to him the 
other also 

5 40 and if ani man will sue thee at the law and take away thi coat 
let him have thi cloak also 

5 41 and whosoev shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain 

5 42 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of 
thee turn not thou away 

5 43 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thi 
neighbour and hate thine enemi 

5 44 but i say unto you love your enemi bless them that cur you 
do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despit 
use you and persecut you 5 45 that ye may be the child of your 
father which is in heaven for he maketh hi sun to rise on the evil 
and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust 

5 46 for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not 
even the publican the same 5 47 and if ye salut your brother 
onli what do ye more than other do not even the publican so 5 48 
be ye therefor perfect even a your father which is in heaven is 
perfect 

6 1 take heed that ye do not your alm befor men to be seen of them 
otherwi ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven 

6 2 therefor when thou doest thine alm do not sound a trumpet 
befor thee a the hypocrit do in the synagogu and in the 
street that they may have glori of men verili i say unto you they 
have their reward 

6 3 but when thou doest alm let not thi left hand know what thi 
right hand doeth 6 4 that thine alm may be in secret and thi father 
which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openli 

6 5 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be a the hypocrit are 
for they love to pray stand in the synagogu and in the corner of 
the street that they may be seen of men verili i say unto you they 
have their reward 

6 6 but thou when thou prayest enter into thi closet and when thou 
hast shut thi door pray to thi father which is in secret and thi 
father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openli 

6 7 but when ye pray use not vain repetit a the heathen do for 
they think that they shall be heard for their much speak 

6 8 be not ye therefor like unto them for your father knoweth what 
thing ye have need of befor ye ask him 

6 9 after thi manner therefor pray ye our father which art in 
heaven hallow be thi name 

6 10 thi kingdom come thi will be done in earth a it is in heaven 

6 11 give u thi day our daili bread 

6 12 and forgiv u our debt a we forgiv our debtor 

6 13 and lead u not into temptat but deliv u from evil for 
thine is the kingdom and the power and the glori for ever amen 

6 14 for if ye forgiv men their trespass your heavenli father will 
also forgiv you 6 15 but if ye forgiv not men their trespass 
neither will your father forgiv your trespass 

6 16 moreov when ye fast be not a the hypocrit of a sad 
counten for they disfigur their face that they may appear unto 
men to fast verili i say unto you they have their reward 

6 17 but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thi 
face 6 18 that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thi father 
which is in secret and thi father which seeth in secret shall 
reward thee openli 

6 19 lay not up for yourselv treasur upon earth where moth and 
rust doth corrupt and where thief break through and steal 6 20 but 
lay up for yourselv treasur in heaven where neither moth nor rust 
doth corrupt and where thief do not break through nor steal 6 21 
for where your treasur is there will your heart be also 

6 22 the light of the bodi is the eye if therefor thine eye be 
singl thi whole bodi shall be full of light 

6 23 but if thine eye be evil thi whole bodi shall be full of 
dark 

if therefor the light that is in thee be dark how great is that 
dark 6 24 no man can serv two master for either he will hate 
the one and love the other or el he will hold to the one and 
despi the other ye cannot serv god and mammon 

6 25 therefor i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye 
shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your bodi what ye 
shall put on is not the life more than meat and the bodi than 
raiment 6 26 behold the fowl of the air for they sow not neither 
do they reap nor gather into barn yet your heavenli father feedeth 
them are ye not much better than they 6 27 which of you by take 
thought can add one cubit unto hi statur 6 28 and whi take ye 
thought for raiment consid the lili of the field how they grow 
they toil not neither do they spin 6 29 and yet i say unto you that 
even solomon in all hi glori wa not array like one of these 

6 30 wherefor if god so cloth the grass of the field which to day 
is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more cloth 
you o ye of littl faith 6 31 therefor take no thought say 
what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith shall we 
be cloth 6 32 for after all these thing do the gentil seek 
for your heavenli father knoweth that ye have need of all these 
thing 

6 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and hi righteou and 
all these thing shall be ad unto you 

6 34 take therefor no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall 
take thought for the thing of itself suffici unto the day is the 
evil thereof 

7 1 judg not that ye be not judg 

7 2 for with what judgment ye judg ye shall be judg and with what 
measur ye mete it shall be measur to you again 

7 3 and whi beholdest thou the mote that is in thi brother s eye but 
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye 7 4 or how wilt 
thou say to thi brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye 
and behold a beam is in thine own eye 7 5 thou hypocrit first 
cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see 
clearli to cast out the mote out of thi brother s eye 

7 6 give not that which is holi unto the dog neither cast ye your 
pearl befor swine lest they trampl them under their foot and turn 
again and rend you 

7 7 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock 
and it shall be open unto you 7 8 for everi one that asketh 
receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it 
shall be open 

7 9 or what man is there of you whom if hi son ask bread will he 
give him a stone 7 10 or if he ask a fish will he give him a 
serpent 7 11 if ye then be evil know how to give good gift 
unto your child how much more shall your father which is in heaven 
give good thing to them that ask him 7 12 therefor all thing 
whatsoev ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them 
for thi is the law and the prophet 

7 13 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad 
is the way that leadeth to destruct and mani there be which go in 
thereat 7 14 becau strait is the gate and narrow is the way which 
leadeth unto life and few there be that find it 

7 15 bewar of fal prophet which come to you in sheep s cloth 
but inwardli they are raven wolf 

7 16 ye shall know them by their fruit do men gather grape of 
thorn or fig of thistl 7 17 even so everi good tree bringeth 
forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit 

7 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt 
tree bring forth good fruit 

7 19 everi tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and 
cast into the fire 

7 20 wherefor by their fruit ye shall know them 

7 21 not everi one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into 
the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which 
is in heaven 

7 22 mani will say to me in that day lord lord have we not 
prophesi in thi name and in thi name have cast out devil and in 
thi name done mani wonder work 7 23 and then will i profess unto 
them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniqu 

7 24 therefor whosoev heareth these say of mine and doeth 
them i will liken him unto a wise man which built hi hou upon a 
rock 7 25 and the rain descend and the flood came and the wind 
blew and beat upon that hou and it fell not for it wa found 
upon a rock 

7 26 and everi one that heareth these say of mine and doeth them 
not shall be liken unto a foolish man which built hi hou upon 
the sand 7 27 and the rain descend and the flood came and the 
wind blew and beat upon that hou and it fell and great wa the 
fall of it 

7 28 and it came to pa when jesu had end these say the 
peopl were astonish at hi doctrin 7 29 for he taught them a one 
have author and not a the scribe 

8 1 when he wa come down from the mountain great multitud follow 
him 

8 2 and behold there came a leper and worship him say lord 
if thou wilt thou canst make me clean 

8 3 and jesu put forth hi hand and touch him say i will be 
thou clean and immedi hi leprosi wa clean 

8 4 and jesu saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thi way 
shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that mose command 
for a testimoni unto them 

8 5 and when jesu wa enter into capernaum there came unto him a 
centurion beseech him 8 6 and say lord my servant lieth at 
home sick of the palsi grievou torment 

8 7 and jesu saith unto him i will come and heal him 

8 8 the centurion answer and said lord i am not worthi that thou 
shouldest come under my roof but speak the word onli and my servant 
shall be heal 

8 9 for i am a man under author have soldier under me and i 
say to thi man go and he goeth and to anoth come and he 
cometh and to my servant do thi and he doeth it 

8 10 when jesu heard it he marvel and said to them that 
follow verili i say unto you i have not found so great faith no 
not in israel 

8 11 and i say unto you that mani shall come from the east and west 
and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom 
of heaven 

8 12 but the child of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer 
dark there shall be weep and gnash of teeth 

8 13 and jesu said unto the centurion go thi way and a thou hast 
believ so be it done unto thee and hi servant wa heal in the 
selfsam hour 

8 14 and when jesu wa come into peter s hou he saw hi wife s 
mother laid and sick of a fever 

8 15 and he touch her hand and the fever left her and she aro 
and minist unto them 

8 16 when the even wa come they brought unto him mani that were 
poss with devil and he cast out the spirit with hi word and 
heal all that were sick 8 17 that it might be fulfil which wa 
spoken by esaia the prophet say himself took our infirm 
and bare our sick 

8 18 now when jesu saw great multitud about him he gave 
command to depart unto the other side 

8 19 and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will 
follow thee whithersoev thou goest 

8 20 and jesu saith unto him the fox have hole and the bird of 
the air have nest but the son of man hath not where to lay hi head 

8 21 and anoth of hi discipl said unto him lord suffer me first 
to go and buri my father 

8 22 but jesu said unto him follow me and let the dead buri their 
dead 

8 23 and when he wa enter into a ship hi discipl follow him 

8 24 and behold there aro a great tempest in the sea insomuch 
that the ship wa cover with the wave but he wa asleep 

8 25 and hi discipl came to him and awok him say lord save 
u we perish 

8 26 and he saith unto them whi are ye fear o ye of littl faith 
then he aro and rebuk the wind and the sea and there wa a 
great calm 

8 27 but the men marvel say what manner of man is thi that 
even the wind and the sea obey him 8 28 and when he wa come to the 
other side into the countri of the gergesen there met him two 
poss with devil come out of the tomb exceed fierc so 
that no man might pa by that way 

8 29 and behold they cri out say what have we to do with 
thee jesu thou son of god art thou come hither to torment u 
befor the time 8 30 and there wa a good way off from them an herd 
of mani swine feed 

8 31 so the devil besought him say if thou cast u out suffer 
u to go away into the herd of swine 

8 32 and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went 
into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran 
violent down a steep place into the sea and perish in the water 

8 33 and they that kept them fled and went their way into the citi 
and told everi thing and what wa befallen to the poss of the 
devil 

8 34 and behold the whole citi came out to meet jesu and when they 
saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coast 

9 1 and he enter into a ship and pa over and came into hi own 
citi 

9 2 and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsi lie on 
a bed and jesu see their faith said unto the sick of the palsi 
son be of good cheer thi sin be forgiven thee 

9 3 and behold certain of the scribe said within themselv thi 
man blasphemeth 

9 4 and jesu know their thought said wherefor think ye evil in 
your heart 9 5 for whether is easier to say thi sin be forgiven 
thee or to say ari and walk 9 6 but that ye may know that the 
son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin then saith he to the 
sick of the palsi ari take up thi bed and go unto thine hou 

9 7 and he aro and depart to hi hou 

9 8 but when the multitud saw it they marvel and glorifi god 
which had given such power unto men 

9 9 and a jesu pa forth from thenc he saw a man name 
matthew sit at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him 
follow me and he aro and follow him 

9 10 and it came to pa a jesu sat at meat in the hou behold 
mani publican and sinner came and sat down with him and hi 
discipl 

9 11 and when the pharis saw it they said unto hi discipl whi 
eateth your master with publican and sinner 9 12 but when jesu 
heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a 
physician but they that are sick 

9 13 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have merci and not 
sacrif for i am not come to call the righteou but sinner to 
repent 

9 14 then came to him the discipl of john say whi do we and the 
pharis fast oft but thi discipl fast not 9 15 and jesu said 
unto them can the child of the bridechamb mourn a long a the 
bridegroom is with them but the day will come when the bridegroom 
shall be taken from them and then shall they fast 

9 16 no man putteth a piec of new cloth unto an old garment for that 
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is 
made wor 

9 17 neither do men put new wine into old bottl el the bottl 
break and the wine runneth out and the bottl perish but they put 
new wine into new bottl and both are preserv 

9 18 while he spake these thing unto them behold there came a 
certain ruler and worship him say my daughter is even now 
dead but come and lay thi hand upon her and she shall live 

9 19 and jesu aro and follow him and so did hi discipl 

9 20 and behold a woman which wa disea with an issu of blood 
twelv year came behind him and touch the hem of hi garment 
9 21 for she said within herself if i may but touch hi garment i 
shall be whole 

9 22 but jesu turn him about and when he saw her he said 
daughter be of good comfort thi faith hath made thee whole and the 
woman wa made whole from that hour 

9 23 and when jesu came into the ruler s hou and saw the minstrel 
and the peopl make a noi 9 24 he said unto them give place for 
the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laugh him to scorn 

9 25 but when the peopl were put forth he went in and took her by 
the hand and the maid aro 

9 26 and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land 

9 27 and when jesu depart thenc two blind men follow him 
cri and say thou son of david have merci on u 

9 28 and when he wa come into the hou the blind men came to him 
and jesu saith unto them believ ye that i am abl to do thi they 
said unto him yea lord 

9 29 then touch he their eye say accord to your faith be it 
unto you 

9 30 and their eye were open and jesu straitli charg them 
say see that no man know it 

9 31 but they when they were depart spread abroad hi fame in all 
that countri 

9 32 a they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man 
poss with a devil 

9 33 and when the devil wa cast out the dumb spake and the 
multitud marvel say it wa never so seen in israel 

9 34 but the pharis said he casteth out devil through the princ 
of the devil 

9 35 and jesu went about all the citi and villag teach in 
their synagogu and preach the gospel of the kingdom and heal 
everi sick and everi disea among the peopl 

9 36 but when he saw the multitud he wa move with compass on 
them becau they faint and were scatter abroad a sheep have 
no shepherd 

9 37 then saith he unto hi discipl the harvest truli is plenteou 
but the labour are few 9 38 pray ye therefor the lord of the 
harvest that he will send forth labour into hi harvest 

10 1 and when he had call unto him hi twelv discipl he gave 
them power against unclean spirit to cast them out and to heal all 
manner of sick and all manner of disea 

10 2 now the name of the twelv apostl are these the first simon 
who is call peter and andrew hi brother jame the son of zebed 
and john hi brother 10 3 philip and bartholomew thoma and 
matthew the publican jame the son of alphaeu and lebbaeu whose 
surnam wa thaddaeu 10 4 simon the canaanit and juda iscariot 
who also betray him 

10 5 these twelv jesu sent forth and command them say go not 
into the way of the gentil and into ani citi of the samaritan 
enter ye not 10 6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the hou of 
israel 

10 7 and a ye go preach say the kingdom of heaven is at hand 

10 8 heal the sick clean the leper rai the dead cast out 
devil freeli ye have receiv freeli give 

10 9 provid neither gold nor silver nor brass in your pur 10 10 
nor scrip for your journey neither two coat neither shoe nor yet 
stave for the workman is worthi of hi meat 

10 11 and into whatsoev citi or town ye shall enter enquir who in 
it is worthi and there abid till ye go thenc 

10 12 and when ye come into an hou salut it 

10 13 and if the hou be worthi let your peac come upon it but if 
it be not worthi let your peac return to you 

10 14 and whosoev shall not receiv you nor hear your word when 
ye depart out of that hou or citi shake off the dust of your foot 

10 15 verili i say unto you it shall be more toler for the land 
of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that citi 

10 16 behold i send you forth a sheep in the midst of wolf be ye 
therefor wise a serpent and harmless a dove 

10 17 but bewar of men for they will deliv you up to the council 
and they will scourg you in their synagogu 10 18 and ye shall be 
brought befor governor and king for my sake for a testimoni 
against them and the gentil 

10 19 but when they deliv you up take no thought how or what ye 
shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall 
speak 

10 20 for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which 
speaketh in you 

10 21 and the brother shall deliv up the brother to death and the 
father the child and the child shall rise up against their 
parent and cau them to be put to death 

10 22 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name s sake but he that 
endureth to the end shall be save 

10 23 but when they persecut you in thi citi flee ye into anoth 
for verili i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the citi of 
israel till the son of man be come 

10 24 the discipl is not abov hi master nor the servant abov hi 
lord 

10 25 it is enough for the discipl that he be a hi master and the 
servant a hi lord if they have call the master of the hou 
beelzebub how much more shall they call them of hi household 10 26 
fear them not therefor for there is noth cover that shall not 
be reveal and hid that shall not be known 

10 27 what i tell you in dark that speak ye in light and what ye 
hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetop 

10 28 and fear not them which kill the bodi but are not abl to kill 
the soul but rather fear him which is abl to destroy both soul and 
bodi in hell 

10 29 are not two sparrow sold for a farth and one of them shall 
not fall on the ground without your father 

10 30 but the veri hair of your head are all number 

10 31 fear ye not therefor ye are of more valu than mani sparrow 

10 32 whosoev therefor shall confess me befor men him will i 
confess also befor my father which is in heaven 

10 33 but whosoev shall deni me befor men him will i also deni 
befor my father which is in heaven 

10 34 think not that i am come to send peac on earth i came not to 
send peac but a sword 

10 35 for i am come to set a man at varianc against hi father and 
the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her 
mother in law 

10 36 and a man s foe shall be they of hi own household 

10 37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthi of 
me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthi of 
me 

10 38 and he that taketh not hi cross and followeth after me is not 
worthi of me 

10 39 he that findeth hi life shall lose it and he that loseth hi 
life for my sake shall find it 

10 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me 
receiveth him that sent me 

10 41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall 
receiv a prophet s reward and he that receiveth a righteou man in 
the name of a righteou man shall receiv a righteou man s reward 

10 42 and whosoev shall give to drink unto one of these littl one 
a cup of cold water onli in the name of a discipl verili i say unto 
you he shall in no wise lose hi reward 

11 1 and it came to pa when jesu had made an end of command hi 
twelv discipl he depart thenc to teach and to preach in their 
citi 

11 2 now when john had heard in the prison the work of christ he 
sent two of hi discipl 11 3 and said unto him art thou he that 
should come or do we look for anoth 11 4 jesu answer and said 
unto them go and shew john again those thing which ye do hear and 
see 11 5 the blind receiv their sight and the lame walk the leper 
are clean and the deaf hear the dead are rai up and the poor 
have the gospel preach to them 

11 6 and bless is he whosoev shall not be offend in me 

11 7 and a they depart jesu began to say unto the multitud 
concern john what went ye out into the wilder to see a reed 
shaken with the wind 11 8 but what went ye out for to see a man 
cloth in soft raiment behold they that wear soft cloth are in 
king hou 

11 9 but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you 
and more than a prophet 

11 10 for thi is he of whom it is written behold i send my 
messeng befor thi face which shall prepar thi way befor thee 

11 11 verili i say unto you among them that are born of woman there 
hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstand he 
that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he 

11 12 and from the day of john the baptist until now the kingdom of 
heaven suffereth violenc and the violent take it by forc 

11 13 for all the prophet and the law prophesi until john 

11 14 and if ye will receiv it thi is elia which wa for to come 

11 15 he that hath ear to hear let him hear 

11 16 but whereunto shall i liken thi gener it is like unto 
child sit in the market and call unto their fellow 11 17 
and say we have pipe unto you and ye have not danc we have 
mourn unto you and ye have not lament 

11 18 for john came neither eat nor drink and they say he hath 
a devil 

11 19 the son of man came eat and drink and they say behold a 
man glutton and a winebibb a friend of publican and sinner 
but wisdom is justifi of her child 

11 20 then began he to upbraid the citi wherein most of hi mighti 
work were done becau they repent not 11 21 woe unto thee 
chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighti work which 
were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have 
repent long ago in sackcloth and ash 

11 22 but i say unto you it shall be more toler for tyre and 
sidon at the day of judgment than for you 

11 23 and thou capernaum which art exalt unto heaven shalt be 
brought down to hell for if the mighti work which have been done in 
thee had been done in sodom it would have remain until thi day 

11 24 but i say unto you that it shall be more toler for the land 
of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee 

11 25 at that time jesu answer and said i thank thee o father 
lord of heaven and earth becau thou hast hid these thing from the 
wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe 

11 26 even so father for so it seem good in thi sight 

11 27 all thing are deliv unto me of my father and no man 
knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth ani man the father 
save the son and he to whomsoev the son will reveal him 

11 28 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavi laden and i will 
give you rest 

11 29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowli 
in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul 

11 30 for my yoke is easi and my burden is light 

12 1 at that time jesu went on the sabbath day through the corn and 
hi discipl were an hungr and began to pluck the ear of corn and 
to eat 

12 2 but when the pharis saw it they said unto him behold thi 
discipl do that which is not law to do upon the sabbath day 

12 3 but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he 
wa an hungr and they that were with him 12 4 how he enter into 
the hou of god and did eat the shewbread which wa not law for 
him to eat neither for them which were with him but onli for the 
priest 12 5 or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath 
day the priest in the templ profan the sabbath and are blameless 
12 6 but i say unto you that in thi place is one greater than the 
templ 

12 7 but if ye had known what thi meaneth i will have merci and not 
sacrif ye would not have condemn the guiltless 

12 8 for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day 

12 9 and when he wa depart thenc he went into their synagogu 
12 10 and behold there wa a man which had hi hand wither and 
they ask him say is it law to heal on the sabbath day that 
they might accu him 

12 11 and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that 
shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day 
will he not lay hold on it and lift it out 12 12 how much then is a 
man better than a sheep wherefor it is law to do well on the 
sabbath day 

12 13 then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he 
stretch it forth and it wa restor whole like a the other 

12 14 then the pharis went out and held a council against him how 
they might destroy him 

12 15 but when jesu knew it he withdrew himself from thenc and 
great multitud follow him and he heal them all 12 16 and 
charg them that they should not make him known 12 17 that it might 
be fulfil which wa spoken by esaia the prophet say 12 18 
behold my servant whom i have chosen my belov in whom my soul is 
well plea i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew 
judgment to the gentil 

12 19 he shall not strive nor cri neither shall ani man hear hi 
voic in the street 

12 20 a brui reed shall he not break and smoke flax shall he not 
quench till he send forth judgment unto victori 

12 21 and in hi name shall the gentil trust 

12 22 then wa brought unto him one poss with a devil blind and 
dumb and he heal him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake 
and saw 

12 23 and all the peopl were amaz and said is not thi the son of 
david 12 24 but when the pharis heard it they said thi fellow 
doth not cast out devil but by beelzebub the princ of the devil 

12 25 and jesu knew their thought and said unto them everi kingdom 
divid against itself is brought to desol and everi citi or 
hou divid against itself shall not stand 12 26 and if satan cast 
out satan he is divid against himself how shall then hi kingdom 
stand 12 27 and if i by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your 
child cast them out therefor they shall be your judg 

12 28 but if i cast out devil by the spirit of god then the kingdom 
of god is come unto you 

12 29 or el how can one enter into a strong man s hou and spoil 
hi good except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil 
hi hou 

12 30 he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not 
with me scattereth abroad 

12 31 wherefor i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemi shall 
be forgiven unto men but the blasphemi against the holi ghost shall 
not be forgiven unto men 

12 32 and whosoev speaketh a word against the son of man it shall 
be forgiven him but whosoev speaketh against the holi ghost it 
shall not be forgiven him neither in thi world neither in the world 
to come 

12 33 either make the tree good and hi fruit good or el make the 
tree corrupt and hi fruit corrupt for the tree is known by hi 
fruit 

12 34 o gener of viper how can ye be evil speak good 
thing for out of the abund of the heart the mouth speaketh 

12 35 a good man out of the good treasur of the heart bringeth forth 
good thing and an evil man out of the evil treasur bringeth forth 
evil thing 

12 36 but i say unto you that everi idl word that men shall speak 
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment 

12 37 for by thi word thou shalt be justifi and by thi word thou 
shalt be condemn 

12 38 then certain of the scribe and of the pharis answer 
say master we would see a sign from thee 

12 39 but he answer and said unto them an evil and adult 
gener seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to 
it but the sign of the prophet jona 12 40 for a jona wa three 
day and three night in the whale s belli so shall the son of man be 
three day and three night in the heart of the earth 

12 41 the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with thi gener 
and shall condemn it becau they repent at the preach of jona 
and behold a greater than jona is here 

12 42 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with thi 
gener and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost 
part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a 
greater than solomon is here 

12 43 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through 
dri place seek rest and findeth none 

12 44 then he saith i will return into my hou from whenc i came 
out and when he is come he findeth it empti swept and garnish 

12 45 then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirit more 
wick than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last 
state of that man is wor than the first even so shall it be also 
unto thi wick gener 

12 46 while he yet talk to the peopl behold hi mother and hi 
brother stood without desir to speak with him 

12 47 then one said unto him behold thi mother and thi brother 
stand without desir to speak with thee 

12 48 but he answer and said unto him that told him who is my 
mother and who are my brother 12 49 and he stretch forth hi 
hand toward hi discipl and said behold my mother and my brother 
12 50 for whosoev shall do the will of my father which is in heaven 
the same is my brother and sister and mother 

13 1 the same day went jesu out of the hou and sat by the sea 
side 

13 2 and great multitud were gather togeth unto him so that he 
went into a ship and sat and the whole multitud stood on the shore 

13 3 and he spake mani thing unto them in parabl say behold a 
sower went forth to sow 13 4 and when he sow some seed fell by 
the way side and the fowl came and devour them up 13 5 some fell 
upon stoni place where they had not much earth and forthwith they 
sprung up becau they had no deep of earth 13 6 and when the 
sun wa up they were scorch and becau they had no root they 
wither away 

13 7 and some fell among thorn and the thorn sprung up and choke 
them 13 8 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit 
some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold 

13 9 who hath ear to hear let him hear 

13 10 and the discipl came and said unto him whi speakest thou 
unto them in parabl 13 11 he answer and said unto them becau 
it is given unto you to know the mysteri of the kingdom of heaven 
but to them it is not given 

13 12 for whosoev hath to him shall be given and he shall have 
more abund but whosoev hath not from him shall be taken away 
even that he hath 

13 13 therefor speak i to them in parabl becau they see see 
not and hear they hear not neither do they understand 

13 14 and in them is fulfil the propheci of esaia which saith by 
hear ye shall hear and shall not understand and see ye shall 
see and shall not perceiv 13 15 for thi peopl s heart is wax 
gross and their ear are dull of hear and their eye they have 
close lest at ani time they should see with their eye and hear with 
their ear and should understand with their heart and should be 
convert and i should heal them 

13 16 but bless are your eye for they see and your ear for they 
hear 

13 17 for verili i say unto you that mani prophet and righteou men 
have desir to see those thing which ye see and have not seen them 
and to hear those thing which ye hear and have not heard them 

13 18 hear ye therefor the parabl of the sower 

13 19 when ani one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth 
it not then cometh the wick one and catcheth away that which wa 
sown in hi heart thi is he which receiv seed by the way side 

13 20 but he that receiv the seed into stoni place the same is he 
that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it 13 21 yet hath 
he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribul 
or persecut ariseth becau of the word by and by he is offend 

13 22 he also that receiv seed among the thorn is he that heareth 
the word and the care of thi world and the deceit of rich 
choke the word and he becometh unfruit 

13 23 but he that receiv seed into the good ground is he that 
heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and 
bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixti some thirti 

13 24 anoth parabl put he forth unto them say the kingdom of 
heaven is liken unto a man which sow good seed in hi field 13 25 
but while men slept hi enemi came and sow tare among the wheat 
and went hi way 

13 26 but when the blade wa sprung up and brought forth fruit then 
appear the tare also 

13 27 so the servant of the household came and said unto him sir 
didst not thou sow good seed in thi field from whenc then hath it 
tare 13 28 he said unto them an enemi hath done thi the servant 
said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up 13 29 
but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tare ye root up also 
the wheat with them 

13 30 let both grow togeth until the harvest and in the time of 
harvest i will say to the reaper gather ye togeth first the tare 
and bind them in bundl to burn them but gather the wheat into my 
barn 

13 31 anoth parabl put he forth unto them say the kingdom of 
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sow 
in hi field 13 32 which ind is the least of all seed but when 
it is grown it is the greatest among herb and becometh a tree so 
that the bird of the air come and lodg in the branch thereof 

13 33 anoth parabl spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is 
like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measur of 
meal till the whole wa leaven 

13 34 all these thing spake jesu unto the multitud in parabl and 
without a parabl spake he not unto them 13 35 that it might be 
fulfil which wa spoken by the prophet say i will open my 
mouth in parabl i will utter thing which have been kept secret 
from the foundat of the world 

13 36 then jesu sent the multitud away and went into the hou and 
hi discipl came unto him say declar unto u the parabl of 
the tare of the field 

13 37 he answer and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is 
the son of man 13 38 the field is the world the good seed are the 
child of the kingdom but the tare are the child of the wick 
one 13 39 the enemi that sow them is the devil the harvest is the 
end of the world and the reaper are the angel 

13 40 a therefor the tare are gather and burn in the fire so 
shall it be in the end of thi world 

13 41 the son of man shall send forth hi angel and they shall 
gather out of hi kingdom all thing that offend and them which do 
iniqu 13 42 and shall cast them into a furnac of fire there 
shall be wail and gnash of teeth 

13 43 then shall the righteou shine forth a the sun in the kingdom 
of their father who hath ear to hear let him hear 

13 44 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasur hid in a 
field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof 
goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field 

13 45 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man 
seek goodli pearl 13 46 who when he had found one pearl of great 
price went and sold all that he had and bought it 

13 47 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that wa cast 
into the sea and gather of everi kind 13 48 which when it wa 
full they drew to shore and sat down and gather the good into 
vessel but cast the bad away 

13 49 so shall it be at the end of the world the angel shall come 
forth and sever the wick from among the just 13 50 and shall cast 
them into the furnac of fire there shall be wail and gnash of 
teeth 

13 51 jesu saith unto them have ye understood all these thing they 
say unto him yea lord 

13 52 then said he unto them therefor everi scribe which is 
instruct unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an 
household which bringeth forth out of hi treasur thing new and 
old 

13 53 and it came to pa that when jesu had finish these 
parabl he depart thenc 

13 54 and when he wa come into hi own countri he taught them in 
their synagogu insomuch that they were astonish and said whenc 
hath thi man thi wisdom and these mighti work 13 55 is not thi 
the carpent s son is not hi mother call mari and hi brother 
jame and jose and simon and juda 13 56 and hi sister are 
they not all with u whenc then hath thi man all these thing 
13 57 and they were offend in him but jesu said unto them a 
prophet is not without honour save in hi own countri and in hi own 
hou 

13 58 and he did not mani mighti work there becau of their 
unbelief 

14 1 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesu 14 2 
and said unto hi servant thi is john the baptist he is risen from 
the dead and therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him 

14 3 for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in 
prison for herodia sake hi brother philip s wife 

14 4 for john said unto him it is not law for thee to have her 

14 5 and when he would have put him to death he fear the multitud 
becau they count him a a prophet 

14 6 but when herod s birthday wa kept the daughter of herodia 
danc befor them and plea herod 

14 7 whereupon he promi with an oath to give her whatsoev she 
would ask 

14 8 and she be befor instruct of her mother said give me 
here john baptist s head in a charger 

14 9 and the king wa sorri nevertheless for the oath s sake and 
them which sat with him at meat he command it to be given her 

14 10 and he sent and behead john in the prison 

14 11 and hi head wa brought in a charger and given to the damsel 
and she brought it to her mother 

14 12 and hi discipl came and took up the bodi and buri it and 
went and told jesu 

14 13 when jesu heard of it he depart thenc by ship into a desert 
place apart and when the peopl had heard thereof they follow him 
on foot out of the citi 

14 14 and jesu went forth and saw a great multitud and wa move 
with compass toward them and he heal their sick 

14 15 and when it wa even hi discipl came to him say thi 
is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitud away 
that they may go into the villag and buy themselv victual 

14 16 but jesu said unto them they need not depart give ye them to 
eat 

14 17 and they say unto him we have here but five loaf and two 
fish 

14 18 he said bring them hither to me 

14 19 and he command the multitud to sit down on the grass and 
took the five loaf and the two fish and look up to heaven he 
bless and brake and gave the loaf to hi discipl and the 
discipl to the multitud 

14 20 and they did all eat and were fill and they took up of the 
fragment that remain twelv basket full 

14 21 and they that had eaten were about five thousand men besid 
woman and child 

14 22 and straightway jesu constrain hi discipl to get into a 
ship and to go befor him unto the other side while he sent the 
multitud away 

14 23 and when he had sent the multitud away he went up into a 
mountain apart to pray and when the even wa come he wa there 
alon 

14 24 but the ship wa now in the midst of the sea toss with wave 
for the wind wa contrari 

14 25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesu went unto them 
walk on the sea 

14 26 and when the discipl saw him walk on the sea they were 
troubl say it is a spirit and they cri out for fear 

14 27 but straightway jesu spake unto them say be of good cheer 
it is i be not afraid 

14 28 and peter answer him and said lord if it be thou bid me 
come unto thee on the water 

14 29 and he said come and when peter wa come down out of the ship 
he walk on the water to go to jesu 

14 30 but when he saw the wind boister he wa afraid and 
begin to sink he cri say lord save me 

14 31 and immedi jesu stretch forth hi hand and caught him 
and said unto him o thou of littl faith wherefor didst thou doubt 
14 32 and when they were come into the ship the wind cea 

14 33 then they that were in the ship came and worship him say 
of a truth thou art the son of god 

14 34 and when they were gone over they came into the land of 
gennesaret 

14 35 and when the men of that place had knowledg of him they sent 
out into all that countri round about and brought unto him all that 
were disea 14 36 and besought him that they might onli touch the 
hem of hi garment and a mani a touch were made perfectli whole 

15 1 then came to jesu scribe and pharis which were of 
jerusalem say 15 2 whi do thi discipl transgress the tradit 
of the elder for they wash not their hand when they eat bread 

15 3 but he answer and said unto them whi do ye also transgress the 
command of god by your tradit 15 4 for god command say 
honour thi father and mother and he that curseth father or mother 
let him die the death 

15 5 but ye say whosoev shall say to hi father or hi mother it 
is a gift by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me 15 6 and 
honour not hi father or hi mother he shall be free thu have ye 
made the command of god of none effect by your tradit 

15 7 ye hypocrit well did esaia prophesi of you say 15 8 thi 
peopl draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with 
their lip but their heart is far from me 

15 9 but in vain they do worship me teach for doctrin the 
command of men 

15 10 and he call the multitud and said unto them hear and 
understand 15 11 not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man 
but that which cometh out of the mouth thi defileth a man 

15 12 then came hi discipl and said unto him knowest thou that 
the pharis were offend after they heard thi say 15 13 but 
he answer and said everi plant which my heavenli father hath not 
plant shall be root up 

15 14 let them alon they be blind leader of the blind and if the 
blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch 

15 15 then answer peter and said unto him declar unto u thi 
parabl 

15 16 and jesu said are ye also yet without understand 15 17 do 
not ye yet understand that whatsoev entereth in at the mouth goeth 
into the belli and is cast out into the draught 15 18 but those 
thing which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and 
they defil the man 

15 19 for out of the heart proceed evil thought murder adulteri 
fornic theft fal wit blasphemi 15 20 these are the 
thing which defil a man but to eat with unwashen hand defileth not 
a man 

15 21 then jesu went thenc and depart into the coast of tyre and 
sidon 

15 22 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coast and 
cri unto him say have merci on me o lord thou son of david 
my daughter is grievou vex with a devil 

15 23 but he answer her not a word and hi discipl came and 
besought him say send her away for she crieth after u 

15 24 but he answer and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep 
of the hou of israel 

15 25 then came she and worship him say lord help me 

15 26 but he answer and said it is not meet to take the child s 
bread and to cast it to dog 

15 27 and she said truth lord yet the dog eat of the crumb which 
fall from their master tabl 

15 28 then jesu answer and said unto her o woman great is thi 
faith be it unto thee even a thou wilt and her daughter wa made 
whole from that veri hour 

15 29 and jesu depart from thenc and came nigh unto the sea of 
galil and went up into a mountain and sat down there 

15 30 and great multitud came unto him have with them those that 
were lame blind dumb maim and mani other and cast them down at 
jesu foot and he heal them 15 31 insomuch that the multitud 
wonder when they saw the dumb to speak the maim to be whole the 
lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorifi the god of 
israel 

15 32 then jesu call hi discipl unto him and said i have 
compass on the multitud becau they continu with me now three 
day and have noth to eat and i will not send them away fast 
lest they faint in the way 

15 33 and hi discipl say unto him whenc should we have so much 
bread in the wilder a to fill so great a multitud 15 34 and 
jesu saith unto them how mani loaf have ye and they said seven 
and a few littl fish 

15 35 and he command the multitud to sit down on the ground 

15 36 and he took the seven loaf and the fish and gave thank 
and brake them and gave to hi discipl and the discipl to the 
multitud 

15 37 and they did all eat and were fill and they took up of the 
broken meat that wa left seven basket full 

15 38 and they that did eat were four thousand men besid woman and 
child 

15 39 and he sent away the multitud and took ship and came into the 
coast of magdala 

16 1 the pharis also with the sadduc came and tempt desir 
him that he would shew them a sign from heaven 

16 2 he answer and said unto them when it is even ye say it 
will be fair weather for the sky is red 

16 3 and in the morn it will be foul weather to day for the sky 
is red and lower o ye hypocrit ye can discern the face of the 
sky but can ye not discern the sign of the time 16 4 a wick and 
adult gener seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be 
given unto it but the sign of the prophet jona and he left them 
and depart 

16 5 and when hi discipl were come to the other side they had 
forgotten to take bread 

16 6 then jesu said unto them take heed and bewar of the leaven of 
the pharis and of the sadduc 

16 7 and they reason among themselv say it is becau we have 
taken no bread 

16 8 which when jesu perceiv he said unto them o ye of littl 
faith whi reason ye among yourselv becau ye have brought no 
bread 16 9 do ye not yet understand neither rememb the five 
loaf of the five thousand and how mani basket ye took up 16 10 
neither the seven loaf of the four thousand and how mani basket ye 
took up 16 11 how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it 
not to you concern bread that ye should bewar of the leaven of 
the pharis and of the sadduc 16 12 then understood they how 
that he bade them not bewar of the leaven of bread but of the 
doctrin of the pharis and of the sadduc 

16 13 when jesu came into the coast of caesarea philippi he ask 
hi discipl say whom do men say that i the son of man am 
16 14 and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some 
elia and other jeremia or one of the prophet 

16 15 he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am 16 16 and simon 
peter answer and said thou art the christ the son of the live 
god 

16 17 and jesu answer and said unto him bless art thou simon 
barjona for flesh and blood hath not reveal it unto thee but my 
father which is in heaven 

16 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon thi 
rock i will build my church and the gate of hell shall not prevail 
against it 

16 19 and i will give unto thee the key of the kingdom of heaven and 
whatsoev thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and 
whatsoev thou shalt loo on earth shall be loo in heaven 

16 20 then charg he hi discipl that they should tell no man that 
he wa jesu the christ 

16 21 from that time forth began jesu to shew unto hi discipl how 
that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer mani thing of the elder 
and chief priest and scribe and be kill and be rai again the 
third day 

16 22 then peter took him and began to rebuk him say be it far 
from thee lord thi shall not be unto thee 

16 23 but he turn and said unto peter get thee behind me satan 
thou art an offenc unto me for thou savourest not the thing that be 
of god but those that be of men 

16 24 then said jesu unto hi discipl if ani man will come after 
me let him deni himself and take up hi cross and follow me 

16 25 for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it and whosoev 
will lose hi life for my sake shall find it 

16 26 for what is a man profit if he shall gain the whole world 
and lose hi own soul or what shall a man give in exchang for hi 
soul 16 27 for the son of man shall come in the glori of hi father 
with hi angel and then he shall reward everi man accord to hi 
work 

16 28 verili i say unto you there be some stand here which shall 
not tast of death till they see the son of man come in hi 
kingdom 

17 1 and after six day jesu taketh peter jame and john hi 
brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 17 2 and 
wa transfigur befor them and hi face did shine a the sun and 
hi raiment wa white a the light 

17 3 and behold there appear unto them mose and elia talk 
with him 

17 4 then answer peter and said unto jesu lord it is good for u 
to be here if thou wilt let u make here three tabernacl one for 
thee and one for mose and one for elia 

17 5 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadow them and 
behold a voic out of the cloud which said thi is my belov son 
in whom i am well plea hear ye him 

17 6 and when the discipl heard it they fell on their face and 
were sore afraid 

17 7 and jesu came and touch them and said ari and be not 
afraid 

17 8 and when they had lift up their eye they saw no man save 
jesu onli 

17 9 and a they came down from the mountain jesu charg them 
say tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again 
from the dead 

17 10 and hi discipl ask him say whi then say the scribe 
that elia must first come 17 11 and jesu answer and said unto 
them elia truli shall first come and restor all thing 

17 12 but i say unto you that elia is come alreadi and they knew 
him not but have done unto him whatsoev they list likewi shall 
also the son of man suffer of them 

17 13 then the discipl understood that he spake unto them of john 
the baptist 

17 14 and when they were come to the multitud there came to him a 
certain man kneel down to him and say 17 15 lord have merci 
on my son for he is lunatick and sore vex for ofttim he falleth 
into the fire and oft into the water 

17 16 and i brought him to thi discipl and they could not cure him 

17 17 then jesu answer and said o faithless and perver 
gener how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you 
bring him hither to me 

17 18 and jesu rebuk the devil and he depart out of him and the 
child wa cure from that veri hour 

17 19 then came the discipl to jesu apart and said whi could not 
we cast him out 17 20 and jesu said unto them becau of your 
unbelief for verili i say unto you if ye have faith a a grain of 
mustard seed ye shall say unto thi mountain remov henc to yonder 
place and it shall remov and noth shall be imposs unto you 

17 21 howbeit thi kind goeth not out but by prayer and fast 

17 22 and while they abod in galil jesu said unto them the son 
of man shall be betray into the hand of men 17 23 and they shall 
kill him and the third day he shall be rai again 

and they were exceed sorri 

17 24 and when they were come to capernaum they that receiv tribut 
money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribut 
17 25 he saith ye and when he wa come into the hou jesu 
prevent him say what thinkest thou simon of whom do the king 
of the earth take custom or tribut of their own child or of 
stranger 17 26 peter saith unto him of stranger jesu saith unto 
him then are the child free 

17 27 notwithstand lest we should offend them go thou to the sea 
and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when 
thou hast open hi mouth thou shalt find a piec of money that 
take and give unto them for me and thee 

18 1 at the same time came the discipl unto jesu say who is 
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven 18 2 and jesu call a littl 
child unto him and set him in the midst of them 18 3 and said 
verili i say unto you except ye be convert and becom a littl 
child ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven 

18 4 whosoev therefor shall humbl himself a thi littl child 
the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven 

18 5 and whoso shall receiv one such littl child in my name 
receiveth me 

18 6 but whoso shall offend one of these littl one which believ in 
me it were better for him that a millston were hang about hi 
neck and that he were drown in the depth of the sea 

18 7 woe unto the world becau of offenc for it must need be that 
offenc come but woe to that man by whom the offenc cometh 18 8 
wherefor if thi hand or thi foot offend thee cut them off and cast 
them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or 
maim rather than have two hand or two foot to be cast into 
everlast fire 

18 9 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from 
thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather 
than have two eye to be cast into hell fire 

18 10 take heed that ye despi not one of these littl one for i 
say unto you that in heaven their angel do alway behold the face of 
my father which is in heaven 

18 11 for the son of man is come to save that which wa lost 

18 12 how think ye if a man have an hundr sheep and one of them be 
gone astray doth he not leav the nineti and nine and goeth into the 
mountain and seeketh that which is gone astray 18 13 and if so be 
that he find it verili i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that 
sheep than of the nineti and nine which went not astray 

18 14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven 
that one of these littl one should perish 

18 15 moreov if thi brother shall trespass against thee go and tell 
him hi fault between thee and him alon if he shall hear thee thou 
hast gain thi brother 

18 16 but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two 
more that in the mouth of two or three wit everi word may be 
establish 

18 17 and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church 
but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee a an 
heathen man and a publican 

18 18 verili i say unto you whatsoev ye shall bind on earth shall 
be bound in heaven and whatsoev ye shall loo on earth shall be 
loo in heaven 

18 19 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agr on earth a 
touch ani thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of 
my father which is in heaven 

18 20 for where two or three are gather togeth in my name there 
am i in the midst of them 

18 21 then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother 
sin against me and i forgiv him till seven time 18 22 jesu 
saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven time but until 
seventi time seven 

18 23 therefor is the kingdom of heaven liken unto a certain king 
which would take account of hi servant 

18 24 and when he had begun to reckon one wa brought unto him which 
owe him ten thousand talent 

18 25 but forasmuch a he had not to pay hi lord command him to be 
sold and hi wife and child and all that he had and payment to 
be made 

18 26 the servant therefor fell down and worship him say 
lord have patienc with me and i will pay thee all 

18 27 then the lord of that servant wa move with compass and 
loo him and forgav him the debt 

18 28 but the same servant went out and found one of hi 
fellowserv which owe him an hundr penni and he laid hand on 
him and took him by the throat say pay me that thou owest 

18 29 and hi fellowserv fell down at hi foot and besought him 
say have patienc with me and i will pay thee all 

18 30 and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he 
should pay the debt 

18 31 so when hi fellowserv saw what wa done they were veri 
sorri and came and told unto their lord all that wa done 

18 32 then hi lord after that he had call him said unto him o 
thou wick servant i forgav thee all that debt becau thou 
desiredst me 18 33 shouldest not thou also have had compass on thi 
fellowserv even a i had piti on thee 18 34 and hi lord wa 
wroth and deliv him to the tormentor till he should pay all 
that wa due unto him 

18 35 so likewi shall my heavenli father do also unto you if ye 
from your heart forgiv not everi one hi brother their trespass 

19 1 and it came to pa that when jesu had finish these say 
he depart from galil and came into the coast of judaea beyond 
jordan 19 2 and great multitud follow him and he heal them 
there 

19 3 the pharis also came unto him tempt him and say unto 
him is it law for a man to put away hi wife for everi cau 
19 4 and he answer and said unto them have ye not read that he 
which made them at the begin made them male and femal 19 5 and 
said for thi cau shall a man leav father and mother and shall 
cleav to hi wife and they twain shall be one flesh 19 6 wherefor 
they are no more twain but one flesh what therefor god hath join 
togeth let not man put asund 

19 7 they say unto him whi did mose then command to give a write 
of divorc and to put her away 19 8 he saith unto them mose 
becau of the hard of your heart suffer you to put away your 
wife but from the begin it wa not so 

19 9 and i say unto you whosoev shall put away hi wife except it 
be for fornic and shall marri anoth committeth adulteri and 
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adulteri 

19 10 hi discipl say unto him if the case of the man be so with 
hi wife it is not good to marri 

19 11 but he said unto them all men cannot receiv thi say save 
they to whom it is given 

19 12 for there are some eunuch which were so born from their 
mother s womb and there are some eunuch which were made eunuch of 
men and there be eunuch which have made themselv eunuch for the 
kingdom of heaven s sake he that is abl to receiv it let him 
receiv it 

19 13 then were there brought unto him littl child that he should 
put hi hand on them and pray and the discipl rebuk them 

19 14 but jesu said suffer littl child and forbid them not to 
come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven 

19 15 and he laid hi hand on them and depart thenc 

19 16 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good 
thing shall i do that i may have etern life 19 17 and he said 
unto him whi callest thou me good there is none good but one that 
is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the command 

19 18 he saith unto him which jesu said thou shalt do no murder 
thou shalt not commit adulteri thou shalt not steal thou shalt not 
bear fal wit 19 19 honour thi father and thi mother and thou 
shalt love thi neighbour a thyself 

19 20 the young man saith unto him all these thing have i kept from 
my youth up what lack i yet 19 21 jesu said unto him if thou wilt 
be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou 
shalt have treasur in heaven and come and follow me 

19 22 but when the young man heard that say he went away 
sorrow for he had great poss 

19 23 then said jesu unto hi discipl verili i say unto you that 
a rich man shall hardli enter into the kingdom of heaven 

19 24 and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through 
the eye of a needl than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of 
god 

19 25 when hi discipl heard it they were exceedingli amaz 
say who then can be save 19 26 but jesu beheld them and said 
unto them with men thi is imposs but with god all thing are 
possibl 

19 27 then answer peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken 
all and follow thee what shall we have therefor 19 28 and jesu 
said unto them verili i say unto you that ye which have follow me 
in the regen when the son of man shall sit in the throne of hi 
glori ye also shall sit upon twelv throne judg the twelv 
tribe of israel 

19 29 and everi one that hath forsaken hou or brother or 
sister or father or mother or wife or child or land for my 
name s sake shall receiv an hundredfold and shall inherit 
everlast life 

19 30 but mani that are first shall be last and the last shall be 
first 

20 1 for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an 
household which went out earli in the morn to hire labour 
into hi vineyard 

20 2 and when he had agr with the labour for a penni a day he 
sent them into hi vineyard 

20 3 and he went out about the third hour and saw other stand 
idl in the marketplac 20 4 and said unto them go ye also into the 
vineyard and whatsoev is right i will give you and they went their 
way 

20 5 again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did 
likewi 

20 6 and about the eleventh hour he went out and found other 
stand idl and saith unto them whi stand ye here all the day 
idl 20 7 they say unto him becau no man hath hire u he saith 
unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoev is right that 
shall ye receiv 

20 8 so when even wa come the lord of the vineyard saith unto hi 
steward call the labour and give them their hire begin from 
the last unto the first 

20 9 and when they came that were hire about the eleventh hour they 
receiv everi man a penni 

20 10 but when the first came they suppo that they should have 
receiv more and they likewi receiv everi man a penni 

20 11 and when they had receiv it they murmur against the goodman 
of the hou 20 12 say these last have wrought but one hour and 
thou hast made them equal unto u which have born the burden and 
heat of the day 

20 13 but he answer one of them and said friend i do thee no 
wrong didst not thou agr with me for a penni 20 14 take that 
thine is and go thi way i will give unto thi last even a unto 
thee 

20 15 is it not law for me to do what i will with mine own is 
thine eye evil becau i am good 20 16 so the last shall be first 
and the first last for mani be call but few chosen 

20 17 and jesu go up to jerusalem took the twelv discipl apart 
in the way and said unto them 20 18 behold we go up to jerusalem 
and the son of man shall be betray unto the chief priest and unto 
the scribe and they shall condemn him to death 20 19 and shall 
deliv him to the gentil to mock and to scourg and to crucifi 
him and the third day he shall rise again 

20 20 then came to him the mother of zebed child with her son 
worship him and desir a certain thing of him 

20 21 and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant 
that these my two son may sit the one on thi right hand and the 
other on the left in thi kingdom 

20 22 but jesu answer and said ye know not what ye ask are ye 
abl to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptiz 
with the baptism that i am baptiz with they say unto him we are 
abl 

20 23 and he saith unto them ye shall drink ind of my cup and be 
baptiz with the baptism that i am baptiz with but to sit on my 
right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given 
to them for whom it is prepar of my father 

20 24 and when the ten heard it they were move with indign 
against the two brother 

20 25 but jesu call them unto him and said ye know that the 
princ of the gentil exerci dominion over them and they that are 
great exerci author upon them 

20 26 but it shall not be so among you but whosoev will be great 
among you let him be your minist 20 27 and whosoev will be chief 
among you let him be your servant 20 28 even a the son of man came 
not to be minist unto but to minist and to give hi life a 
ransom for mani 

20 29 and a they depart from jericho a great multitud follow 
him 

20 30 and behold two blind men sit by the way side when they 
heard that jesu pa by cri out say have merci on u o 
lord thou son of david 

20 31 and the multitud rebuk them becau they should hold their 
peac but they cri the more say have merci on u o lord thou 
son of david 

20 32 and jesu stood still and call them and said what will ye 
that i shall do unto you 20 33 they say unto him lord that our 
eye may be open 

20 34 so jesu had compass on them and touch their eye and 
immedi their eye receiv sight and they follow him 

21 1 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to 
bethphag unto the mount of oliv then sent jesu two discipl 
21 2 say unto them go into the villag over against you and 
straightway ye shall find an a tie and a colt with her loo 
them and bring them unto me 

21 3 and if ani man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath 
need of them and straightway he will send them 

21 4 all thi wa done that it might be fulfil which wa spoken by 
the prophet say 21 5 tell ye the daughter of sion behold thi 
king cometh unto thee meek and sit upon an a and a colt the 
foal of an a 

21 6 and the discipl went and did a jesu command them 21 7 and 
brought the a and the colt and put on them their cloth and they 
set him thereon 

21 8 and a veri great multitud spread their garment in the way 
other cut down branch from the tree and straw them in the way 

21 9 and the multitud that went befor and that follow cri 
say hosanna to the son of david bless is he that cometh in the 
name of the lord hosanna in the highest 

21 10 and when he wa come into jerusalem all the citi wa move 
say who is thi 21 11 and the multitud said thi is jesu the 
prophet of nazareth of galil 

21 12 and jesu went into the templ of god and cast out all them 
that sold and bought in the templ and overthrew the tabl of the 
moneychang and the seat of them that sold dove 21 13 and said 
unto them it is written my hou shall be call the hou of 
prayer but ye have made it a den of thief 

21 14 and the blind and the lame came to him in the templ and he 
heal them 

21 15 and when the chief priest and scribe saw the wonder thing 
that he did and the child cri in the templ and say 
hosanna to the son of david they were sore displea 21 16 and said 
unto him hearest thou what these say and jesu saith unto them yea 
have ye never read out of the mouth of babe and suckl thou hast 
perfect prai 21 17 and he left them and went out of the citi 
into bethani and he lodg there 

21 18 now in the morn a he return into the citi he hunger 

21 19 and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found 
noth thereon but leaf onli and said unto it let no fruit grow 
on thee henceforward for ever and present the fig tree wither 
away 

21 20 and when the discipl saw it they marvel say how soon 
is the fig tree wither away 21 21 jesu answer and said unto 
them verili i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall 
not onli do thi which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall 
say unto thi mountain be thou remov and be thou cast into the 
sea it shall be done 

21 22 and all thing whatsoev ye shall ask in prayer believ ye 
shall receiv 

21 23 and when he wa come into the templ the chief priest and the 
elder of the peopl came unto him a he wa teach and said by 
what author doest thou these thing and who gave thee thi 
author 21 24 and jesu answer and said unto them i also will 
ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you 
by what author i do these thing 

21 25 the baptism of john whenc wa it from heaven or of men and 
they reason with themselv say if we shall say from heaven 
he will say unto u whi did ye not then believ him 21 26 but if we 
shall say of men we fear the peopl for all hold john a a prophet 

21 27 and they answer jesu and said we cannot tell and he said 
unto them neither tell i you by what author i do these thing 

21 28 but what think ye a certain man had two son and he came to 
the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard 

21 29 he answer and said i will not but afterward he repent and 
went 

21 30 and he came to the second and said likewi and he answer 
and said i go sir and went not 

21 31 whether of them twain did the will of hi father they say unto 
him the first jesu saith unto them verili i say unto you that the 
publican and the harlot go into the kingdom of god befor you 

21 32 for john came unto you in the way of righteou and ye 
believ him not but the publican and the harlot believ him and 
ye when ye had seen it repent not afterward that ye might believ 
him 

21 33 hear anoth parabl there wa a certain household which 
plant a vineyard and hedg it round about and dig a winepress 
in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandman and went into 
a far countri 21 34 and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent 
hi servant to the husbandman that they might receiv the fruit of 
it 

21 35 and the husbandman took hi servant and beat one and kill 
anoth and stone anoth 

21 36 again he sent other servant more than the first and they did 
unto them likewi 

21 37 but last of all he sent unto them hi son say they will 
rever my son 

21 38 but when the husbandman saw the son they said among themselv 
thi is the heir come let u kill him and let u seiz on hi 
inherit 

21 39 and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew 
him 

21 40 when the lord therefor of the vineyard cometh what will he do 
unto those husbandman 21 41 they say unto him he will miser 
destroy those wick men and will let out hi vineyard unto other 
husbandman which shall render him the fruit in their season 

21 42 jesu saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptur the 
stone which the builder reject the same is becom the head of the 
corner thi is the lord s do and it is marvel in our eye 
21 43 therefor say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from 
you and given to a nation bring forth the fruit thereof 

21 44 and whosoev shall fall on thi stone shall be broken but on 
whomsoev it shall fall it will grind him to powder 

21 45 and when the chief priest and pharis had heard hi parabl 
they perceiv that he spake of them 

21 46 but when they sought to lay hand on him they fear the 
multitud becau they took him for a prophet 

22 1 and jesu answer and spake unto them again by parabl and 
said 22 2 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which 
made a marriag for hi son 22 3 and sent forth hi servant to call 
them that were bidden to the wed and they would not come 

22 4 again he sent forth other servant say tell them which are 
bidden behold i have prepar my dinner my ox and my fatl are 
kill and all thing are readi come unto the marriag 

22 5 but they made light of it and went their way one to hi farm 
anoth to hi merchandi 22 6 and the remnant took hi servant 
and entreat them spite and slew them 

22 7 but when the king heard thereof he wa wroth and he sent forth 
hi armi and destroy those murder and burn up their citi 

22 8 then saith he to hi servant the wed is readi but they 
which were bidden were not worthi 

22 9 go ye therefor into the highway and a mani a ye shall find 
bid to the marriag 

22 10 so those servant went out into the highway and gather 
togeth all a mani a they found both bad and good and the wed 
wa furnish with guest 

22 11 and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man 
which had not on a wed garment 22 12 and he saith unto him 
friend how camest thou in hither not have a wed garment and he 
wa speechless 

22 13 then said the king to the servant bind him hand and foot and 
take him away and cast him into outer dark there shall be 
weep and gnash of teeth 

22 14 for mani are call but few are chosen 

22 15 then went the pharis and took counsel how they might 
entangl him in hi talk 

22 16 and they sent out unto him their discipl with the herodian 
say master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of 
god in truth neither carest thou for ani man for thou regardest not 
the person of men 

22 17 tell u therefor what thinkest thou is it law to give 
tribut unto caesar or not 22 18 but jesu perceiv their 
wick and said whi tempt ye me ye hypocrit 22 19 shew me 
the tribut money and they brought unto him a penni 

22 20 and he saith unto them whose is thi imag and superscript 
22 21 they say unto him caesar s then saith he unto them render 
therefor unto caesar the thing which are caesar s and unto god the 
thing that are god s 

22 22 when they had heard these word they marvel and left him 
and went their way 

22 23 the same day came to him the sadduc which say that there is 
no resurrect and ask him 22 24 say master mose said if a 
man die have no child hi brother shall marri hi wife and 
rai up seed unto hi brother 

22 25 now there were with u seven brother and the first when he 
had marri a wife decea and have no issu left hi wife unto 
hi brother 22 26 likewi the second also and the third unto the 
seventh 

22 27 and last of all the woman die also 

22 28 therefor in the resurrect whose wife shall she be of the 
seven for they all had her 

22 29 jesu answer and said unto them ye do err not know the 
scriptur nor the power of god 

22 30 for in the resurrect they neither marri nor are given in 
marriag but are a the angel of god in heaven 

22 31 but a touch the resurrect of the dead have ye not read 
that which wa spoken unto you by god say 22 32 i am the god of 
abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the 
god of the dead but of the live 

22 33 and when the multitud heard thi they were astonish at hi 
doctrin 

22 34 but when the pharis had heard that he had put the sadduc 
to silenc they were gather togeth 

22 35 then one of them which wa a lawyer ask him a question 
tempt him and say 22 36 master which is the great command 
in the law 22 37 jesu said unto him thou shalt love the lord thi 
god with all thi heart and with all thi soul and with all thi mind 

22 38 thi is the first and great command 

22 39 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thi neighbour a 
thyself 

22 40 on these two command hang all the law and the prophet 

22 41 while the pharis were gather togeth jesu ask them 
22 42 say what think ye of christ whose son is he they say unto 
him the son of david 

22 43 he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord 
say 22 44 the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 
till i make thine enemi thi footstool 22 45 if david then call him 
lord how is he hi son 22 46 and no man wa abl to answer him a 
word neither durst ani man from that day forth ask him ani more 
question 

23 1 then spake jesu to the multitud and to hi discipl 23 2 
say the scribe and the pharis sit in mose seat 23 3 all 
therefor whatsoev they bid you observ that observ and do but do 
not ye after their work for they say and do not 

23 4 for they bind heavi burden and grievou to be born and lay 
them on men s shoulder but they themselv will not move them with 
one of their finger 

23 5 but all their work they do for to be seen of men they make 
broad their phylacteri and enlarg the border of their garment 
23 6 and love the uppermost room at feast and the chief seat in 
the synagogu 23 7 and greet in the market and to be call of 
men rabbi rabbi 

23 8 but be not ye call rabbi for one is your master even christ 
and all ye are brother 

23 9 and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your 
father which is in heaven 

23 10 neither be ye call master for one is your master even

24 1 and jesu went out and depart from the templ and hi 
discipl came to him for to shew him the build of the templ 

24 2 and jesu said unto them see ye not all these thing verili i

24 3 and a he sat upon the mount of oliv the discipl came unto 
him privat say tell u when shall these thing be and what 
shall be the sign of thi come and of the end of the world 24 4 
and jesu answer and said unto them take heed that no man deceiv

24 5 for mani shall come in my name say i am christ and shall 
deceiv mani 

24 6 and ye shall hear of war and rumour of war see that ye be not 
troubl for all these thing must come to pa but the end is not 
yet 

24 7 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against 
kingdom and there shall be famin and pestil and earthquak 
in diver place 

24 8 all these are the begin of sorrow 

24 9 then shall they deliv you up to be afflict and shall kill

24 14 and thi gospel of the kingdom shall be preach in all the 
world for a wit unto all nation and then shall the end come 

24 15 when ye therefor shall see the abomin of desol 
spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holi place whoso 
readeth let him understand 24 16 then let them which be in judaea 
flee into the mountain 24 17 let him which is on the housetop not 
come down to take ani thing out of hi hou 24 18 neither let him 
which is in the field return back to take hi cloth 

24 19 and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give

winter neither on the sabbath day 24 21 for then shall be great 
tribul such a wa not sinc the begin of the world to thi 
time no nor ever shall be 

24 22 and except those day should be shorten there should no flesh 
be save but for the elect s sake those day shall be shorten 

24 23 then if ani man shall say unto you lo here is christ or 
there believ it not 

24 24 for there shall ari fal christ and fal prophet and 
shall shew great sign and wonder insomuch that if it were 
possibl they shall deceiv the veri elect 

24 25 behold i have told you befor 

24 26 wherefor if they shall say unto you behold he is in the 
desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chamber believ it 
not 

24 27 for a the lightn cometh out of the east and shineth even 
unto the west so shall also the come of the son of man be 

24 28 for wheresoev the carca is there will the eagl be 
gather togeth 

24 29 immedi after the tribul of those day shall the sun be 
darken and the moon shall not give her light and the star shall 
fall from heaven and the power of the heaven shall be shaken 24 30 
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then 
shall all the tribe of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of 
man come in the cloud of heaven with power and great glori 

24 31 and he shall send hi angel with a great sound of a trumpet 
and they shall gather togeth hi elect from the four wind from one 
end of heaven to the other 

24 32 now learn a parabl of the fig tree when hi branch is yet 
tender and putteth forth leaf ye know that summer is nigh 24 33 
so likewi ye when ye shall see all these thing know that it is 
near even at the door 

24 34 verili i say unto you thi gener shall not pa till all 
these thing be fulfil 

24 35 heaven and earth shall pa away but my word shall not pa 
away 

24 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angel of 
heaven but my father onli 

24 37 but a the day of noe were so shall also the come of the son 
of man be 

24 38 for a in the day that were befor the flood they were eat 
and drink marri and give in marriag until the day that noe 
enter into the ark 24 39 and knew not until the flood came and 
took them all away so shall also the come of the son of man be 

24 40 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the 
other left 

24 41 two woman shall be grind at the mill the one shall be taken 
and the other left 

24 42 watch therefor for ye know not what hour your lord doth come 

24 43 but know thi that if the goodman of the hou had known in 
what watch the thief would come he would have watch and would not 
have suffer hi hou to be broken up 

24 44 therefor be ye also readi for in such an hour a ye think not 
the son of man cometh 

24 45 who then is a faith and wise servant whom hi lord hath made 
ruler over hi household to give them meat in due season 24 46 
bless is that servant whom hi lord when he cometh shall find so 
do 

24 47 verili i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all hi 
good 

24 48 but and if that evil servant shall say in hi heart my lord 
delayeth hi come 24 49 and shall begin to smite hi 
fellowserv and to eat and drink with the drunken 24 50 the lord 
of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and 
in an hour that he is not awar of 24 51 and shall cut him asund 
and appoint him hi portion with the hypocrit there shall be 
weep and gnash of teeth 

25 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be liken unto ten virgin 
which took their lamp and went forth to meet the bridegroom 

25 2 and five of them were wise and five were foolish 

25 3 they that were foolish took their lamp and took no oil with 
them 25 4 but the wise took oil in their vessel with their lamp 

25 5 while the bridegroom tarri they all slumber and slept 

25 6 and at midnight there wa a cri made behold the bridegroom 
cometh go ye out to meet him 

25 7 then all those virgin aro and trim their lamp 

25 8 and the foolish said unto the wise give u of your oil for our 
lamp are gone out 

25 9 but the wise answer say not so lest there be not enough 
for u and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for 
yourselv 

25 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that 
were readi went in with him to the marriag and the door wa shut 

25 11 afterward came also the other virgin say lord lord open 
to u 

25 12 but he answer and said verili i say unto you i know you not 

25 13 watch therefor for ye know neither the day nor the hour 
wherein the son of man cometh 

25 14 for the kingdom of heaven is a a man travel into a far 
countri who call hi own servant and deliv unto them hi 
good 

25 15 and unto one he gave five talent to anoth two and to 
anoth one to everi man accord to hi sever abil and 
straightway took hi journey 

25 16 then he that had receiv the five talent went and trade with 
the same and made them other five talent 

25 17 and likewi he that had receiv two he also gain other two 

25 18 but he that had receiv one went and dig in the earth and 
hid hi lord s money 

25 19 after a long time the lord of those servant cometh and 
reckoneth with them 

25 20 and so he that had receiv five talent came and brought other 
five talent say lord thou deliveredst unto me five talent 
behold i have gain besid them five talent more 

25 21 hi lord said unto him well done thou good and faith 
servant thou hast been faith over a few thing i will make thee 
ruler over mani thing enter thou into the joy of thi lord 

25 22 he also that had receiv two talent came and said lord thou 
deliveredst unto me two talent behold i have gain two other 
talent besid them 

25 23 hi lord said unto him well done good and faith servant 
thou hast been faith over a few thing i will make thee ruler over 
mani thing enter thou into the joy of thi lord 

25 24 then he which had receiv the one talent came and said lord i 
knew thee that thou art an hard man reap where thou hast not sown 
and gather where thou hast not straw 25 25 and i wa afraid and 
went and hid thi talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is

25 26 hi lord answer and said unto him thou wick and sloth 
servant thou knewest that i reap where i sow not and gather where 
i have not straw 25 27 thou oughtest therefor to have put my money 
to the exchang and then at my come i should have receiv mine 
own with usuri 

25 28 take therefor the talent from him and give it unto him which 
hath ten talent 

25 29 for unto everi one that hath shall be given and he shall have 
abund but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that 
which he hath 

25 30 and cast ye the unprofit servant into outer dark there 
shall be weep and gnash of teeth 

25 31 when the son of man shall come in hi glori and all the holi 
angel with him then shall he sit upon the throne of hi glori 25 32 
and befor him shall be gather all nation and he shall separ 
them one from anoth a a shepherd divideth hi sheep from the 
goat 25 33 and he shall set the sheep on hi right hand but the 
goat on the left 

25 34 then shall the king say unto them on hi right hand come ye 
bless of my father inherit the kingdom prepar for you from the 
foundat of the world 25 35 for i wa an hungr and ye gave me 
meat i wa thirsti and ye gave me drink i wa a stranger and ye 
took me in 25 36 nake and ye cloth me i wa sick and ye visit 
me i wa in prison and ye came unto me 

25 37 then shall the righteou answer him say lord when saw we 
thee an hungr and fed thee or thirsti and gave thee drink 25 38 
when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or nake and cloth 
thee 25 39 or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto 
thee 25 40 and the king shall answer and say unto them verili i say 
unto you inasmuch a ye have done it unto one of the least of these 
my brother ye have done it unto me 

25 41 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from 
me ye cur into everlast fire prepar for the devil and hi 
angel 25 42 for i wa an hungr and ye gave me no meat i wa 
thirsti and ye gave me no drink 25 43 i wa a stranger and ye took 
me not in nake and ye cloth me not sick and in prison and ye 
visit me not 

25 44 then shall they also answer him say lord when saw we thee 
an hungr or athirst or a stranger or nake or sick or in 
prison and did not minist unto thee 25 45 then shall he answer 
them say verili i say unto you inasmuch a ye did it not to one 
of the least of these ye did it not to me 

25 46 and these shall go away into everlast punish but the 
righteou into life etern 

26 1 and it came to pa when jesu had finish all these say 
he said unto hi discipl 26 2 ye know that after two day is the 
feast of the passov and the son of man is betray to be crucifi 

26 3 then assembl togeth the chief priest and the scribe and 
the elder of the peopl unto the palac of the high priest who wa 
call caiapha 26 4 and consult that they might take jesu by 
subtilti and kill him 

26 5 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar 
among the peopl 

26 6 now when jesu wa in bethani in the hou of simon the leper 
26 7 there came unto him a woman have an alabast box of veri 
preciou ointment and pour it on hi head a he sat at meat 

26 8 but when hi discipl saw it they had indign say to 
what purpo is thi wast 26 9 for thi ointment might have been 
sold for much and given to the poor 

26 10 when jesu understood it he said unto them whi troubl ye the 
woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me 

26 11 for ye have the poor alway with you but me ye have not alway 

26 12 for in that she hath pour thi ointment on my bodi she did it 
for my burial 

26 13 verili i say unto you wheresoev thi gospel shall be preach 
in the whole world there shall also thi that thi woman hath done 
be told for a memori of her 

26 14 then one of the twelv call juda iscariot went unto the 
chief priest 26 15 and said unto them what will ye give me and i 
will deliv him unto you and they coven with him for thirti 
piec of silver 

26 16 and from that time he sought opportun to betray him 

26 17 now the first day of the feast of unleaven bread the discipl 
came to jesu say unto him where wilt thou that we prepar for 
thee to eat the passov 26 18 and he said go into the citi to such 
a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will 
keep the passov at thi hou with my discipl 

26 19 and the discipl did a jesu had appoint them and they made 
readi the passov 

26 20 now when the even wa come he sat down with the twelv 

26 21 and a they did eat he said verili i say unto you that one of 
you shall betray me 

26 22 and they were exceed sorrow and began everi one of them 
to say unto him lord is it i 26 23 and he answer and said he 
that dippeth hi hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me 

26 24 the son of man goeth a it is written of him but woe unto that 
man by whom the son of man is betray it had been good for that man 
if he had not been born 

26 25 then juda which betray him answer and said master is it

26 26 and a they were eat jesu took bread and bless it and 
brake it and gave it to the discipl and said take eat thi is 
my bodi 

26 27 and he took the cup and gave thank and gave it to them 
say drink ye all of it 26 28 for thi is my blood of the new 
testament which is shed for mani for the remiss of sin 

26 29 but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of thi fruit of 
the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father s 
kingdom 

26 30 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of 
oliv 

26 31 then saith jesu unto them all ye shall be offend becau of 
me thi night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the 
sheep of the flock shall be scatter abroad 

26 32 but after i am risen again i will go befor you into galil 

26 33 peter answer and said unto him though all men shall be 
offend becau of thee yet will i never be offend 

26 34 jesu said unto him verili i say unto thee that thi night 
befor the cock crow thou shalt deni me thrice 

26 35 peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i 
not deni thee likewi also said all the discipl 

26 36 then cometh jesu with them unto a place call gethseman and 
saith unto the discipl sit ye here while i go and pray yonder 

26 37 and he took with him peter and the two son of zebed and 
began to be sorrow and veri heavi 

26 38 then saith he unto them my soul is exceed sorrow even 
unto death tarri ye here and watch with me 

26 39 and he went a littl farther and fell on hi face and pray 
say o my father if it be possibl let thi cup pa from me 
nevertheless not a i will but a thou wilt 

26 40 and he cometh unto the discipl and findeth them asleep and 
saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour 26 41 
watch and pray that ye enter not into temptat the spirit ind 
is will but the flesh is weak 

26 42 he went away again the second time and pray say o my 
father if thi cup may not pa away from me except i drink it thi 
will be done 

26 43 and he came and found them asleep again for their eye were 
heavi 

26 44 and he left them and went away again and pray the third 
time say the same word 

26 45 then cometh he to hi discipl and saith unto them sleep on 
now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of 
man is betray into the hand of sinner 

26 46 rise let u be go behold he is at hand that doth betray 
me 

26 47 and while he yet spake lo juda one of the twelv came and

priest and elder of the peopl 

26 48 now he that betray him gave them a sign say whomsoev i 
shall kiss that same is he hold him fast 

26 49 and forthwith he came to jesu and said hail master and 
kiss him 

26 50 and jesu said unto him friend wherefor art thou come then 
came they and laid hand on jesu and took him 

26 51 and behold one of them which were with jesu stretch out hi 
hand and drew hi sword and struck a servant of the high priest s 
and smote off hi ear 

26 52 then said jesu unto him put up again thi sword into hi place 
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword 

26 53 thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall 
present give me more than twelv legion of angel 26 54 but how 
then shall the scriptur be fulfil that thu it must be 26 55 
in that same hour said jesu to the multitud are ye come out a 
against a thief with sword and stave for to take me i sat daili 
with you teach in the templ and ye laid no hold on me 

26 56 but all thi wa done that the scriptur of the prophet might 
be fulfil then all the discipl forsook him and fled 

26 57 and they that had laid hold on jesu led him away to caiapha 
the high priest where the scribe and the elder were assembl 

26 58 but peter follow him afar off unto the high priest s palac 
and went in and sat with the servant to see the end 

26 59 now the chief priest and elder and all the council sought 
fal wit against jesu to put him to death 26 60 but found

christ the son of god 

26 64 jesu saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto

of power and come in the cloud of heaven 

26 65 then the high priest rent hi cloth say he hath spoken 
blasphemi what further need have we of wit behold now ye have 
heard hi blasphemi 

26 66 what think ye they answer and said he is guilti of death 

26 67 then did they spit in hi face and buffet him and other

thee thou jesu of nazareth art thou come to destroy u i know thee 
who thou art the holi one of god 

1 25 and jesu rebuk him say hold thi peac and come out of

1 26 and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cri with a loud 
voic he came out of him 

1 27 and they were all amaz insomuch that they question among 
themselv say what thing is thi what new doctrin is thi for 
with author commandeth he even the unclean spirit and they do 
obey him 

1 28 and immedi hi fame spread abroad throughout all the region 
round about galil 

1 29 and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogu they 
enter into the hou of simon and andrew with jame and john 

1 30 but simon s wife s mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell 
him of her 

1 31 and he came and took her by the hand and lift her up and

1 42 and a soon a he had spoken immedi the leprosi depart

1 43 and he straitli charg him and forthwith sent him away 1 44 
and saith unto him see thou say noth to ani man but go thi way 
shew thyself to the priest and offer for thi clean those thing 
which mose command for a testimoni unto them 

1 45 but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze 
abroad the matter insomuch that jesu could no more openli enter into 
the citi but wa without in desert place and they came to him from 
everi quarter 

2 1 and again he enter into capernaum after some day and it wa 
noi that he wa in the hou 

2 2 and straightway mani were gather togeth insomuch that there 
wa no room to receiv them no not so much a about the door and he 
preach the word unto them 

2 3 and they come unto him bring one sick of the palsi which wa 
born of four 

2 4 and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they 
uncov the roof where he wa and when they had broken it up they 
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsi lay 

2 5 when jesu saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsi 
son thi sin be forgiven thee 

2 6 but there wa certain of the scribe sit there and reason 
in their heart 2 7 whi doth thi man thu speak blasphemi who can 
forgiv sin but god onli 2 8 and immedi when jesu perceiv 
in hi spirit that they so reason within themselv he said unto 
them whi reason ye these thing in your heart 2 9 whether is it 
easier to say to the sick of the palsi thi sin be forgiven thee or 
to say ari and take up thi bed and walk 2 10 but that ye may 
know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgiv sin he 
saith to the sick of the palsi 2 11 i say unto thee ari and take 
up thi bed and go thi way into thine hou 

2 12 and immedi he aro took up the bed and went forth befor 
them all insomuch that they were all amaz and glorifi god 
say we never saw it on thi fashion 

2 13 and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitud 
resort unto him and he taught them

discipl for there were mani and they follow him 

2 16 and when the scribe and pharis saw him eat with publican and 
sinner they said unto hi discipl how is it that he eateth and 
drinketh with publican and sinner 2 17 when jesu heard it he 
saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician 
but they that are sick i came not to call the righteou but sinner 
to repent 

2 18 and the discipl of john and of the pharis use to fast and 
they come and say unto him whi do the discipl of john and of the 
pharis fast but thi discipl fast not 2 19 and jesu said unto 
them can the child of the bridechamb fast while the bridegroom 
is with them a long a they have the bridegroom with them they 
cannot fast 

2 20 but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away 
from them and then shall they fast in those day 

2 21 no man also seweth a piec of new cloth on an old garment el 
the new piec that fill it up taketh away from the old and the rent 
is made wor 

2 22 and no man putteth new wine into old bottl el the new wine 
doth burst the bottl and the wine is spill and the bottl will 
be mar but new wine must be put into new bottl 

2 23 and it came to pa that he went through the corn field on the 
sabbath day and hi discipl began a they went to pluck the ear 
of corn 

2 24 and the pharis said unto him behold whi do they on the 
sabbath day that which is not law 2 25 and he said unto them 
have ye never read what david did when he had need and wa an 
hungr he and they that were with him 2 26 how he went into the 
hou of god in the day of abiathar the high priest and did eat the 
shewbread which is not law to eat but for the priest and gave 
also to them which were with him 2 27 and he said unto them the 
sabbath wa made for man and not man for the sabbath 2 28 therefor 
the son of man is lord also of the sabbath 

3 1 and he enter again into the synagogu and there wa a man there 
which had a wither hand 

3 2 and they watch him whether he would heal him on the sabbath 
day that they might accu him 

3 3 and he saith unto the man which had the wither hand stand 
forth 

3 4 and he saith unto them is it law to do good on the sabbath 
day or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their 
peac 

3 5 and when he had look round about on them with anger be 
griev for the hard of their heart he saith unto the man 
stretch forth thine hand and he stretch it out and hi hand wa 
restor whole a the other 

3 6 and the pharis went forth and straightway took counsel with 
the herodian against him how they might destroy him 

3 7 but jesu withdrew himself with hi discipl to the sea and a 
great multitud from galil follow him and from judaea 3 8 and 
from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and they 
about tyre and sidon a great multitud when they had heard what 
great thing he did came unto him 

3 9 and he spake to hi discipl that a small ship should wait on 
him becau of the multitud lest they should throng him 

3 10 for he had heal mani insomuch that they press upon him for 
to touch him a mani a had plagu 

3 11 and unclean spirit when they saw him fell down befor him and 
cri say thou art the son of god 

3 12 and he straitli charg them that they should not make him known 

3 13 and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he 
would and they came unto him 

3 14 and he ordain twelv that they should be with him and that he 
might send them forth to preach 3 15 and to have power to heal 
sick and to cast out devil 3 16 and simon he surnam peter 
3 17 and jame the son of zebed and john the brother of jame and 
he surnam them boanerg which is the son of thunder 3 18 and 
andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thoma and 
jame the son of alphaeu and thaddaeu and simon the canaanit 
3 19 and juda iscariot which also betray him and they went into 
an hou 

3 20 and the multitud cometh togeth again so that they could not 
so much a eat bread 

3 21 and when hi friend heard of it they went out to lay hold on 
him for they said he is besid himself 

3 22 and the scribe which came down from jerusalem said he hath 
beelzebub and by the princ of the devil casteth he out devil 

3 23 and he call them unto him and said unto them in parabl how 
can satan cast out satan 3 24 and if a kingdom be divid against 
itself that kingdom cannot stand 

3 25 and if a hou be divid against itself that hou cannot 
stand 

3 26 and if satan rise up against himself and be divid he cannot 
stand but hath an end 

3 27 no man can enter into a strong man s hou and spoil hi good 
except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil hi 
hou 

3 28 verili i say unto you all sin shall be forgiven unto the son 
of men and blasphemi wherewith soever they shall blasphem 3 29 
but he that shall blasphem against the holi ghost hath never 
forgiv but is in danger of etern damnat 

3 30 becau they said he hath an unclean spirit 

3 31 there came then hi brother and hi mother and stand 
without sent unto him call him 

3 32 and the multitud sat about him and they said unto him behold 
thi mother and thi brother without seek for thee 

3 33 and he answer them say who is my mother or my brother 
3 34 and he look round about on them which sat about him and said 
behold my mother and my brother 3 35 for whosoev shall do the 
will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother 

4 1 and he began again to teach by the sea side and there wa 
gather unto him a great multitud so that he enter into a ship 
and sat in the sea and the whole multitud wa by the sea on the 
land 

4 2 and he taught them mani thing by parabl and said unto them in 
hi doctrin 4 3 hearken behold there went out a sower to sow 4 4 
and it came to pa a he sow some fell by the way side and the 
fowl of the air came and devour it up 

4 5 and some fell on stoni ground where it had not much earth and 
immedi it sprang up becau it had no depth of earth 4 6 but 
when the sun wa up it wa scorch and becau it had no root it 
wither away 

4 7 and some fell among thorn and the thorn grew up and choke it 
and it yield no fruit 

4 8 and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up 
and increa and brought forth some thirti and some sixti and 
some an hundr 

4 9 and he said unto them he that hath ear to hear let him hear 

4 10 and when he wa alon they that were about him with the twelv 
ask of him the parabl 

4 11 and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteri 
of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these 
thing are done in parabl 4 12 that see they may see and not 
perceiv and hear they may hear and not understand lest at ani 
time they should be convert and their sin should be forgiven them 

4 13 and he said unto them know ye not thi parabl and how then 
will ye know all parabl 4 14 the sower soweth the word 

4 15 and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but 
when they have heard satan cometh immedi and taketh away the 
word that wa sown in their heart 

4 16 and these are they likewi which are sown on stoni ground who 
when they have heard the word immedi receiv it with glad 
4 17 and have no root in themselv and so endur but for a time 
afterward when afflict or persecut ariseth for the word s sake 
immedi they are offend 

4 18 and these are they which are sown among thorn such a hear the 
word 4 19 and the care of thi world and the deceit of 
rich and the lust of other thing enter in choke the word and 
it becometh unfruit 

4 20 and these are they which are sown on good ground such a hear 
the word and receiv it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some 
sixti and some an hundr 

4 21 and he said unto them is a candl brought to be put under a 
bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick 4 22 for 
there is noth hid which shall not be manifest neither wa ani 
thing kept secret but that it should come abroad 

4 23 if ani man have ear to hear let him hear 

4 24 and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measur 
ye mete it shall be measur to you and unto you that hear shall 
more be given 

4 25 for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not 
from him shall be taken even that which he hath 

4 26 and he said so is the kingdom of god a if a man should cast 
seed into the ground 4 27 and should sleep and rise night and day 
and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how 

4 28 for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade 
then the ear after that the full corn in the ear 

4 29 but when the fruit is brought forth immedi he putteth in 
the sickl becau the harvest is come 

4 30 and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with 
what comparison shall we compar it 4 31 it is like a grain of 
mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is le than all 
the seed that be in the earth 4 32 but when it is sown it groweth 
up and becometh greater than all herb and shooteth out great 
branch so that the fowl of the air may lodg under the shadow of 
it 

4 33 and with mani such parabl spake he the word unto them a they 
were abl to hear it 

4 34 but without a parabl spake he not unto them and when they were 
alon he expound all thing to hi discipl 

4 35 and the same day when the even wa come he saith unto them let 
u pa over unto the other side 

4 36 and when they had sent away the multitud they took him even a 
he wa in the ship and there were also with him other littl ship 

4 37 and there aro a great storm of wind and the wave beat into 
the ship so that it wa now full 

4 38 and he wa in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow 
and they awak him and say unto him master carest thou not that we 
perish 4 39 and he aro and rebuk the wind and said unto the 
sea peac be still and the wind cea and there wa a great calm 

4 40 and he said unto them whi are ye so fear how is it that ye 
have no faith 4 41 and they fear exceedingli and said one to 
anoth what manner of man is thi that even the wind and the sea 
obey him 5 1 and they came over unto the other side of the sea into 
the countri of the gadaren 

5 2 and when he wa come out of the ship immedi there met him 
out of the tomb a man with an unclean spirit 5 3 who had hi 
dwell among the tomb and no man could bind him no not with 
chain 5 4 becau that he had been often bound with fetter and 
chain and the chain had been pluck asund by him and the 
fetter broken in piec neither could ani man tame him 

5 5 and alway night and day he wa in the mountain and in the 
tomb cri and cut himself with stone 

5 6 but when he saw jesu afar off he ran and worship him 5 7 and 
cri with a loud voic and said what have i to do with thee jesu 
thou son of the most high god i adjur thee by god that thou torment 
me not 

5 8 for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit 

5 9 and he ask him what is thi name and he answer say my 
name is legion for we are mani 

5 10 and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of 
the countri 

5 11 now there wa there nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine 
feed 

5 12 and all the devil besought him say send u into the swine 
that we may enter into them 

5 13 and forthwith jesu gave them leav and the unclean spirit went 
out and enter into the swine and the herd ran violent down a 
steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were 
choke in the sea 

5 14 and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the citi and in 
the countri and they went out to see what it wa that wa done 

5 15 and they come to jesu and see him that wa poss with the 
devil and had the legion sit and cloth and in hi right 
mind and they were afraid 

5 16 and they that saw it told them how it befel to him that wa 
poss with the devil and also concern the swine 

5 17 and they began to pray him to depart out of their coast 

5 18 and when he wa come into the ship he that had been poss 
with the devil pray him that he might be with him 

5 19 howbeit jesu suffer him not but saith unto him go home to 
thi friend and tell them how great thing the lord hath done for 
thee and hath had compass on thee 

5 20 and he depart and began to publish in decapoli how great 
thing jesu had done for him and all men did marvel 

5 21 and when jesu wa pa over again by ship unto the other side 
much peopl gather unto him and he wa nigh unto the sea 

5 22 and behold there cometh one of the ruler of the synagogu 
jairu by name and when he saw him he fell at hi foot 5 23 and 
besought him greatli say my littl daughter lieth at the point of 
death i pray thee come and lay thi hand on her that she may be 
heal and she shall live 

5 24 and jesu went with him and much peopl follow him and 
throng him 

5 25 and a certain woman which had an issu of blood twelv year 
5 26 and had suffer mani thing of mani physician and had spent 
all that she had and wa noth better but rather grew wor 
5 27 when she had heard of jesu came in the press behind and 
touch hi garment 

5 28 for she said if i may touch but hi cloth i shall be whole 

5 29 and straightway the fountain of her blood wa dri up and she 
felt in her bodi that she wa heal of that plagu 

5 30 and jesu immedi know in himself that virtu had gone 
out of him turn him about in the press and said who touch my 
cloth 5 31 and hi discipl said unto him thou seest the 
multitud throng thee and sayest thou who touch me 5 32 and 
he look round about to see her that had done thi thing 

5 33 but the woman fear and trembl know what wa done in 
her came and fell down befor him and told him all the truth 

5 34 and he said unto her daughter thi faith hath made thee whole

thenc shake off the dust under your foot for a testimoni against

therefor mighti work do shew forth themselv in him 

6 15 other said that it is elia and other said that it is a

6 17 for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and 
bound him in prison for herodia sake hi brother philip s wife for 
he had marri her 

6 18 for john had said unto herod it is not law for thee to have 
thi brother s wife

say i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of 
john the baptist 

6 26 and the king wa exceed sorri yet for hi oath s sake and 
for their sake which sat with him he would not reject her 

6 27 and immedi the king sent an execut and command hi 
head to be brought and he went and behead him in the prison 6 28 
and brought hi head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the 
damsel gave it to her mother 

6 29 and when hi discipl heard of it they came and took up hi 
corp and laid it in a tomb 

6 30 and the apostl gather themselv togeth unto jesu and 
told him all thing both what they had done and what they had 
taught 

6 31 and he said unto them come ye yourselv apart into a desert 
place and rest a while for there were mani come and go and 
they had no leisur so much a to eat 

6 32 and they depart into a desert place by ship privat 

6 33 and the peopl saw them depart and mani knew him and ran 
afoot thither out of all citi and outwent them and came togeth 
unto him 

6 34 and jesu when he came out saw much peopl and wa move with 
compass toward them becau they were a sheep not have a 
shepherd and he began to teach them mani thing 

6 35 and when the day wa now far spent hi discipl came unto him 
and said thi is a desert place and now the time is far pa 6 36 
send them away that they may go into the countri round about and 
into the villag and buy themselv bread for they have noth to 
eat 

6 37 he answer and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say 
unto him shall we go and buy two hundr pennyworth of bread and 
give them to eat 6 38 he saith unto them how mani loaf have ye 
go and see and when they knew they say five and two fish 

6 39 and he command them to make all sit down by compani upon the 
green grass 

6 40 and they sat down in rank by hundr and by fifti 

6 41 and when he had taken the five loaf and the two fish he 
look up to heaven and bless and brake the loaf and gave them 
to hi discipl to set befor them and the two fish divid he 
among them all 

6 42 and they did all eat and were fill 

6 43 and they took up twelv basket full of the fragment and of the 
fish 

6 44 and they that did eat of the loaf were about five thousand men 

6 45 and straightway he constrain hi discipl to get into the 
ship and to go to the other side befor unto bethsaida while he sent 
away the peopl 

6 46 and when he had sent them away he depart into a mountain to 
pray 

6 47 and when even wa come the ship wa in the midst of the sea and 
he alon on the land 

6 48 and he saw them toil in row for the wind wa contrari unto 
them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them 
walk upon the sea and would have pa by them 

6 49 but when they saw him walk upon the sea they suppo it had 
been a spirit and cri out 6 50 for they all saw him and were 
troubl and immedi he talk with them and saith unto them be 
of good cheer it is i be not afraid 

6 51 and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind cea and 
they were sore amaz in themselv beyond measur and wonder 

6 52 for they consid not the miracl of the loaf for their 
heart wa harden 

6 53 and when they had pa over they came into the land of 
gennesaret and drew to the shore 

6 54 and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew 
him 6 55 and ran through that whole region round about and began to 
carri about in bed those that were sick where they heard he wa 

6 56 and whithersoev he enter into villag or citi or 
countri they laid the sick in the street and besought him that they 
might touch if it were but the border of hi garment and a mani a 
touch him were made whole 

7 1 then came togeth unto him the pharis and certain of the 
scribe which came from jerusalem 

7 2 and when they saw some of hi discipl eat bread with defil 
that is to say with unwashen hand they found fault 

7 3 for the pharis and all the jew except they wash their hand 
oft eat not hold the tradit of the elder 

7 4 and when they come from the market except they wash they eat 
not 

and mani other thing there be which they have receiv to hold a 
the wash of cup and pot brasen vessel and of tabl 

7 5 then the pharis and scribe ask him whi walk not thi 
discipl accord to the tradit of the elder but eat bread with 
unwashen hand 7 6 he answer and said unto them well hath esaia 
prophesi of you hypocrit a it is written thi peopl honoureth 
me with their lip but their heart is far from me 

7 7 howbeit in vain do they worship me teach for doctrin the 
command of men 

7 8 for lay asid the command of god ye hold the tradit of 
men a the wash of pot and cup and mani other such like thing 
ye do 

7 9 and he said unto them full well ye reject the command of god 
that ye may keep your own tradit 

7 10 for mose said honour thi father and thi mother and whoso 
curseth father or mother let him die the death 7 11 but ye say if a 
man shall say to hi father or mother it is corban that is to say a 
gift by whatsoev thou mightest be profit by me he shall be free 

7 12 and ye suffer him no more to do ought for hi father or hi 
mother 7 13 make the word of god of none effect through your 
tradit which ye have deliv and mani such like thing do ye 

7 14 and when he had call all the peopl unto him he said unto 
them hearken unto me everi one of you and understand 7 15 there is 
noth from without a man that enter into him can defil him but 
the thing which come out of him those are they that defil the man 

7 16 if ani man have ear to hear let him hear 

7 17 and when he wa enter into the hou from the peopl hi 
discipl ask him concern the parabl 

7 18 and he saith unto them are ye so without understand also do 
ye not perceiv that whatsoev thing from without entereth into the 
man it cannot defil him 7 19 becau it entereth not into hi 
heart but into the belli and goeth out into the draught purg all 
meat 7 20 and he said that which cometh out of the man that 
defileth the man 

7 21 for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thought 
adulteri fornic murder 7 22 theft covet 
wick deceit lascivi an evil eye blasphemi pride 
foolish 7 23 all these evil thing come from within and defil 
the man 

7 24 and from thenc he aro and went into the border of tyre and 
sidon and enter into an hou and would have no man know it but 
he could not be hid 

7 25 for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit 
heard of him and came and fell at hi foot 7 26 the woman wa a 
greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would 
cast forth the devil out of her daughter 

7 27 but jesu said unto her let the child first be fill for it 
is not meet to take the child s bread and to cast it unto the 
dog 

7 28 and she answer and said unto him ye lord yet the dog under 
the tabl eat of the child s crumb 

7 29 and he said unto her for thi say go thi way the devil is 
gone out of thi daughter 

7 30 and when she wa come to her hou she found the devil gone out 
and her daughter laid upon the bed 

7 31 and again depart from the coast of tyre and sidon he came 
unto the sea of galil through the midst of the coast of decapoli 

7 32 and they bring unto him one that wa deaf and had an impedi 
in hi speech and they beseech him to put hi hand upon him 

7 33 and he took him asid from the multitud and put hi finger 
into hi ear and he spit and touch hi tongu 7 34 and look 
up to heaven he sigh and saith unto him ephphatha that is be 
open 

7 35 and straightway hi ear were open and the string of hi 
tongu wa loo and he spake plain 

7 36 and he charg them that they should tell no man but the more he 
charg them so much the more a great deal they publish it 7 37 
and were beyond measur astonish say he hath done all thing 
well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak 

8 1 in those day the multitud be veri great and have noth 
to eat jesu call hi discipl unto him and saith unto them 8 2 
i have compass on the multitud becau they have now been with me 
three day and have noth to eat 8 3 and if i send them away 
fast to their own hou they will faint by the way for diver of 
them came from far 

8 4 and hi discipl answer him from whenc can a man satisfi 
these men with bread here in the wilder 8 5 and he ask them 
how mani loaf have ye and they said seven 

8 6 and he command the peopl to sit down on the ground and he took 
the seven loaf and gave thank and brake and gave to hi 
discipl to set befor them and they did set them befor the peopl 

8 7 and they had a few small fish and he bless and command to 
set them also befor them 

8 8 so they did eat and were fill and they took up of the broken 
meat that wa left seven basket 

8 9 and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them 
away 

8 10 and straightway he enter into a ship with hi discipl and 
came into the part of dalmanutha 

8 11 and the pharis came forth and began to question with him 
seek of him a sign from heaven tempt him 

8 12 and he sigh deepli in hi spirit and saith whi doth thi 
gener seek after a sign verili i say unto you there shall no 
sign be given unto thi gener 

8 13 and he left them and enter into the ship again depart to 
the other side 

8 14 now the discipl had forgotten to take bread neither had they 
in the ship with them more than one loaf 

8 15 and he charg them say take heed bewar of the leaven of 
the pharis and of the leaven of herod 

8 16 and they reason among themselv say it is becau we have 
no bread 

8 17 and when jesu knew it he saith unto them whi reason ye 
becau ye have no bread perceiv ye not yet neither understand 
have ye your heart yet harden 8 18 have eye see ye not and 
have ear hear ye not and do ye not rememb 8 19 when i brake 
the five loaf among five thousand how mani basket full of 
fragment took ye up they say unto him twelv 

8 20 and when the seven among four thousand how mani basket full of 
fragment took ye up and they said seven 

8 21 and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand 8 22 
and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and 
besought him to touch him 

8 23 and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the 
town and when he had spit on hi eye and put hi hand upon him he 
ask him if he saw ought 

8 24 and he look up and said i see men a tree walk 

8 25 after that he put hi hand again upon hi eye and made him 
look up and he wa restor and saw everi man clearli 

8 26 and he sent him away to hi hou say neither go into the 
town nor tell it to ani in the town 

8 27 and jesu went out and hi discipl into the town of caesarea 
philippi and by the way he ask hi discipl say unto them 
whom do men say that i am 8 28 and they answer john the baptist 
but some say elia and other one of the prophet 

8 29 and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter 
answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ 

8 30 and he charg them that they should tell no man of him 

8 31 and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer mani 
thing and be reject of the elder and of the chief priest and 
scribe and be kill and after three day rise again 

8 32 and he spake that say openli and peter took him and began to 
rebuk him 

8 33 but when he had turn about and look on hi discipl he 
rebuk peter say get thee behind me satan for thou savourest 
not the thing that be of god but the thing that be of men 

8 34 and when he had call the peopl unto him with hi discipl 
also he said unto them whosoev will come after me let him deni 
himself and take up hi cross and follow me 

8 35 for whosoev will save hi life shall lose it but whosoev 
shall lose hi life for my sake and the gospel s the same shall save 
it 

8 36 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world 
and lose hi own soul 8 37 or what shall a man give in exchang for 
hi soul 8 38 whosoev therefor shall be asham of me and of my 
word in thi adult and sin gener of him also shall the 
son of man be asham when he cometh in the glori of hi father with 
the holi angel 

9 1 and he said unto them verili i say unto you that there be some 
of them that stand here which shall not tast of death till they 
have seen the kingdom of god come with power 

9 2 and after six day jesu taketh with him peter and jame and 
john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselv 
and he wa transfigur befor them 

9 3 and hi raiment becam shine exceed white a snow so a no 
fuller on earth can white them 

9 4 and there appear unto them elia with mose and they were 
talk with jesu 

9 5 and peter answer and said to jesu master it is good for u to 
be here and let u make three tabernacl one for thee and one for 
mose and one for elia 

9 6 for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid 

9 7 and there wa a cloud that overshadow them and a voic came out 
of the cloud say thi is my belov son hear him 

9 8 and suddenli when they had look round about they saw no man 
ani more save jesu onli with themselv 

9 9 and a they came down from the mountain he charg them that they 
should tell no man what thing they had seen till the son of man were 
risen from the dead 

9 10 and they kept that say with themselv question one with 
anoth what the rise from the dead should mean 

9 11 and they ask him say whi say the scribe that elia must 
first come 9 12 and he answer and told them elia verili cometh 
first and restoreth all thing and how it is written of the son of 
man that he must suffer mani thing and be set at nought 

9 13 but i say unto you that elia is ind come and they have done 
unto him whatsoev they list a it is written of him 

9 14 and when he came to hi discipl he saw a great multitud about 
them and the scribe question with them 

9 15 and straightway all the peopl when they beheld him were 
greatli amaz and run to him salut him 

9 16 and he ask the scribe what question ye with them 9 17 and 
one of the multitud answer and said master i have brought unto 
thee my son which hath a dumb spirit 9 18 and wheresoev he taketh 
him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with hi teeth and 
pineth away and i spake to thi discipl that they should cast him 
out and they could not 

9 19 he answereth him and saith o faithless gener how long 
shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me 

9 20 and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway 
the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallow foam 

9 21 and he ask hi father how long is it ago sinc thi came unto 
him and he said of a child 

9 22 and ofttim it hath cast him into the fire and into the water 
to destroy him but if thou canst do ani thing have compass on u 
and help u 

9 23 jesu said unto him if thou canst believ all thing are 
possibl to him that believeth 

9 24 and straightway the father of the child cri out and said with 
tear lord i believ help thou mine unbelief 

9 25 when jesu saw that the peopl came run togeth he rebuk 
the foul spirit say unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charg 
thee come out of him and enter no more into him 

9 26 and the spirit cri and rent him sore and came out of him and 
he wa a one dead insomuch that mani said he is dead 

9 27 but jesu took him by the hand and lift him up and he aro 

9 28 and when he wa come into the hou hi discipl ask him 
privat whi could not we cast him out 9 29 and he said unto them 
thi kind can come forth by noth but by prayer and fast 

9 30 and they depart thenc and pa through galil and he 
would not that ani man should know it 

9 31 for he taught hi discipl and said unto them the son of man 
is deliv into the hand of men and they shall kill him and after 
that he is kill he shall rise the third day 

9 32 but they understood not that say and were afraid to ask him 

9 33 and he came to capernaum and be in the hou he ask them 
what wa it that ye disput among yourselv by the way 9 34 but 
they held their peac for by the way they had disput among 
themselv who should be the greatest 

9 35 and he sat down and call the twelv and saith unto them if 
ani man desir to be first the same shall be last of all and servant 
of all 

9 36 and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when 
he had taken him in hi arm he said unto them 9 37 whosoev shall 
receiv one of such child in my name receiveth me and whosoev 
shall receiv me receiveth not me but him that sent me 

9 38 and john answer him say master we saw one cast out 
devil in thi name and he followeth not u and we forbad him 
becau he followeth not u 

9 39 but jesu said forbid him not for there is no man which shall 
do a miracl in my name that can lightli speak evil of me 

9 40 for he that is not against u is on our part 

9 41 for whosoev shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name 
becau ye belong to christ verili i say unto you he shall not lose 
hi reward 

9 42 and whosoev shall offend one of these littl one that believ 
in me it is better for him that a millston were hang about hi 
neck and he were cast into the sea 

9 43 and if thi hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to 
enter into life maim than have two hand to go into hell into 
the fire that never shall be quench 9 44 where their worm dieth 
not and the fire is not quench 

9 45 and if thi foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to 
enter halt into life than have two foot to be cast into hell into 
the fire that never shall be quench 9 46 where their worm dieth 
not and the fire is not quench 

9 47 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee 
to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than have two eye to 
be cast into hell fire 9 48 where their worm dieth not and the fire 
is not quench 

9 49 for everi one shall be salt with fire and everi sacrif 
shall be salt with salt 

9 50 salt is good but if the salt have lost hi salt wherewith 
will ye season it have salt in yourselv and have peac one with 
anoth 

10 1 and he aro from thenc and cometh into the coast of judaea by 
the farther side of jordan and the peopl resort unto him again and 
a he wa wont he taught them again 

10 2 and the pharis came to him and ask him is it law for a 
man to put away hi wife tempt him 

10 3 and he answer and said unto them what did mose command you 
10 4 and they said mose suffer to write a bill of divorc and 
to put her away 

10 5 and jesu answer and said unto them for the hard of your 
heart he wrote you thi precept 

10 6 but from the begin of the creation god made them male and 
femal 

10 7 for thi cau shall a man leav hi father and mother and 
cleav to hi wife 10 8 and they twain shall be one flesh so then 
they are no more twain but one flesh 

10 9 what therefor god hath join togeth let not man put asund 

10 10 and in the hou hi discipl ask him again of the same 
matter 

10 11 and he saith unto them whosoev shall put away hi wife and 
marri anoth committeth adulteri against her 

10 12 and if a woman shall put away her husband and be marri to 
anoth she committeth adulteri 

10 13 and they brought young child to him that he should touch 
them and hi discipl rebuk those that brought them 

10 14 but when jesu saw it he wa much displea and said unto 
them suffer the littl child to come unto me and forbid them not 
for of such is the kingdom of god 

10 15 verili i say unto you whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom 
of god a a littl child he shall not enter therein 

10 16 and he took them up in hi arm put hi hand upon them and 
bless them 

10 17 and when he wa gone forth into the way there came one run 
and kneel to him and ask him good master what shall i do that i 
may inherit etern life 10 18 and jesu said unto him whi callest 
thou me good there is none good but one that is god 

10 19 thou knowest the command do not commit adulteri do not 
kill do not steal do not bear fal wit defraud not honour thi 
father and mother 10 20 and he answer and said unto him master 
all these have i observ from my youth 

10 21 then jesu behold him love him and said unto him one thing 
thou lackest go thi way sell whatsoev thou hast and give to the 
poor and thou shalt have treasur in heaven and come take up the 
cross and follow me 

10 22 and he wa sad at that say and went away griev for he had 
great poss 

10 23 and jesu look round about and saith unto hi discipl how 
hardli shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god 
10 24 and the discipl were astonish at hi word but jesu 
answereth again and saith unto them child how hard is it for 
them that trust in rich to enter into the kingdom of god 10 25 it 
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needl than for a 
rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 

10 26 and they were astonish out of measur say among 
themselv who then can be save 10 27 and jesu look upon them 
saith with men it is imposs but not with god for with god all 
thing are possibl 

10 28 then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have 
follow thee 

10 29 and jesu answer and said verili i say unto you there is no 
man that hath left hou or brother or sister or father or 
mother or wife or child or land for my sake and the gospel s 
10 30 but he shall receiv an hundredfold now in thi time hou 
and brother and sister and mother and child and land with 
persecut and in the world to come etern life 

10 31 but mani that are first shall be last and the last first 

10 32 and they were in the way go up to jerusalem and jesu went 
befor them and they were amaz and a they follow they were 
afraid 

and he took again the twelv and began to tell them what thing 
should happen unto him 10 33 say behold we go up to jerusalem 
and the son of man shall be deliv unto the chief priest and unto 
the scribe and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliv 
him to the gentil 10 34 and they shall mock him and shall scourg 
him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he 
shall rise again 

10 35 and jame and john the son of zebed come unto him say

began to cast out them that sold and bought in the templ and 
overthrew the tabl of the moneychang and the seat of them that

vessel through the templ 

11 17 and he taught say unto them is it not written my hou 
shall be call of all nation the hou of prayer but ye have made 
it a den of thief 

11 18 and the scribe and chief priest heard it and sought how they

astonish at hi doctrin 

11 19 and when even wa come he went out of the citi

11 22 and jesu answer saith unto them have faith in god 

11 23 for verili i say unto you that whosoev shall say unto thi 
mountain be thou remov and be thou cast into the sea and shall 
not doubt in hi heart but shall believ that those thing which he

11 27 and they come again to jerusalem and a he wa walk in the 
templ there come to him the chief priest and the scribe and the 
elder 11 28 and say unto him by what author doest thou these 
thing and who gave thee thi author to do these thing 11 29 
and jesu answer and said unto them i will also ask of you one 
question and answer me and i will tell you by what author i do 
these thing 

11 30 the baptism of john wa it from heaven or of men answer me 

11 31 and they reason with themselv say if we shall say from 
heaven he will say whi then did ye not believ him 11 32 but if we 
shall say of men they fear the peopl for all men count john 
that he wa a prophet ind 

11 33 and they answer and said unto jesu we cannot tell and jesu 
answer saith unto them neither do i tell you by what author i 
do these thing 

12 1 and he began to speak unto them by parabl a certain man 
plant a vineyard and set an hedg about it and dig a place for 
the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandman and went 
into a far countri 

12 2 and at the season he sent to the husbandman a servant that he 
might receiv from the husbandman of the fruit of the vineyard 

12 3 and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empti 

12 4 and again he sent unto them anoth servant and at him they cast 
stone and wound him in the head and sent him away shame 
handl 

12 5 and again he sent anoth and him they kill and mani other 
beat some and kill some 

12 6 have yet therefor one son hi wellbelov he sent him also 
last unto them say they will rever my son 

12 7 but those husbandman said among themselv thi is the heir 
come let u kill him and the inherit shall be our s 

12 8 and they took him and kill him and cast him out of the 
vineyard 

12 9 what shall therefor the lord of the vineyard do he will come 
and destroy the husbandman and will give the vineyard unto other 

12 10 and have ye not read thi scriptur the stone which the 
builder reject is becom the head of the corner 12 11 thi wa the 
lord s do and it is marvel in our eye 12 12 and they sought 
to lay hold on him but fear the peopl for they knew that he had 
spoken the parabl against them and they left him and went their 
way 

12 13 and they send unto him certain of the pharis and of the 
herodian to catch him in hi word 

12 14 and when they were come they say unto him master we know that 
thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the 
person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it law to 
give tribut to caesar or not 12 15 shall we give or shall we not 
give but he know their hypocrisi said unto them whi tempt ye 
me bring me a penni that i may see it 

12 16 and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is thi imag 
and superscript and they said unto him caesar s 

12 17 and jesu answer said unto them render to caesar the thing 
that are caesar s and to god the thing that are god s and they 
marvel at him 

12 18 then come unto him the sadduc which say there is no 
resurrect and they ask him say 12 19 master mose wrote 
unto u if a man s brother die and leav hi wife behind him and 
leav no child that hi brother should take hi wife and rai up 
seed unto hi brother 

12 20 now there were seven brother and the first took a wife and 
die left no seed 

12 21 and the second took her and die neither left he ani seed and 
the third likewi 

12 22 and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman 
die also 

12 23 in the resurrect therefor when they shall rise whose wife 
shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife 

12 24 and jesu answer said unto them do ye not therefor err 
becau ye know not the scriptur neither the power of god 12 25 
for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marri nor are 
given in marriag but are a the angel which are in heaven 

12 26 and a touch the dead that they rise have ye not read in 
the book of mose how in the bush god spake unto him say i am 
the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob 12 27 
he is not the god of the dead but the god of the live ye therefor 
do greatli err 

12 28 and one of the scribe came and have heard them reason 
togeth and perceiv that he had answer them well ask him 
which is the first command of all 12 29 and jesu answer him 
the first of all the command is hear o israel the lord our god 
is one lord 12 30 and thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi 
heart and with all thi soul and with all thi mind and with all thi 
strength thi is the first command 

12 31 and the second is like name thi thou shalt love thi 
neighbour a thyself there is none other command greater than 
these 

12 32 and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the 
truth for there is one god and there is none other but he 12 33 and 
to love him with all the heart and with all the understand and 
with all the soul and with all the strength and to love hi 
neighbour a himself is more than all whole burnt offer and 
sacrif 

12 34 and when jesu saw that he answer discreetli he said unto 
him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that 
durst ask him ani question 

12 35 and jesu answer and said while he taught in the templ how 
say the scribe that christ is the son of david 12 36 for david 
himself said by the holi ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on 
my right hand till i make thine enemi thi footstool 

12 37 david therefor himself calleth him lord and whenc is he then 
hi son and the common peopl heard him gladli 

12 38 and he said unto them in hi doctrin bewar of the scribe 
which love to go in long cloth and love salut in the 
marketplac 12 39 and the chief seat in the synagogu and the 
uppermost room at feast 12 40 which devour widow hou and for 
a pretenc make long prayer these shall receiv greater damnat 

12 41 and jesu sat over against the treasuri and beheld how the 
peopl cast money into the treasuri and mani that were rich cast in 
much 

12 42 and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mite 
which make a farth 

12 43 and he call unto him hi discipl and saith unto them 
verili i say unto you that thi poor widow hath cast more in than 
all they which have cast into the treasuri 12 44 for all they did 
cast in of their abund but she of her want did cast in all that 
she had even all her live 

13 1 and a he went out of the templ one of hi discipl saith unto 
him master see what manner of stone and what build are here 
13 2 and jesu answer said unto him seest thou these great 
build there shall not be left one stone upon anoth that shall 
not be thrown down 

13 3 and a he sat upon the mount of oliv over against the templ 
peter and jame and john and andrew ask him privat 13 4 tell u 
when shall these thing be and what shall be the sign when all these 
thing shall be fulfil 13 5 and jesu answer them began to 
say take heed lest ani man deceiv you 13 6 for mani shall come in 
my name say i am christ and shall deceiv mani 

13 7 and when ye shall hear of war and rumour of war be ye not 
troubl for such thing must need be but the end shall not be yet 

13 8 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against 
kingdom and there shall be earthquak in diver place and there 
shall be famin and troubl these are the begin of sorrow 

13 9 but take heed to yourselv for they shall deliv you up to 
council and in the synagogu ye shall be beaten and ye shall be 
brought befor ruler and king for my sake for a testimoni against 
them 

13 10 and the gospel must first be publish among all nation 

13 11 but when they shall lead you and deliv you up take no 
thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premedit but 
whatsoev shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is 
not ye that speak but the holi ghost 

13 12 now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the 
father the son and child shall rise up against their parent and 
shall cau them to be put to death 

13 13 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name s sake but he that 
shall endur unto the end the same shall be save 

13 14 but when ye shall see the abomin of desol spoken of 
by daniel the prophet stand where it ought not let him that 
readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the 
mountain 13 15 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into 
the hou neither enter therein to take ani thing out of hi hou 
13 16 and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take 
up hi garment 

13 17 but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck 
in those day 13 18 and pray ye that your flight be not in the 
winter 

13 19 for in those day shall be afflict such a wa not from the 
begin of the creation which god creat unto thi time neither 
shall be 

13 20 and except that the lord had shorten those day no flesh 
should be save but for the elect s sake whom he hath chosen he 
hath shorten the day 

13 21 and then if ani man shall say to you lo here is christ or 
lo he is there believ him not 13 22 for fal christ and fal 
prophet shall rise and shall shew sign and wonder to seduc if 
it were possibl even the elect 

13 23 but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all thing 

13 24 but in those day after that tribul the sun shall be 
darken and the moon shall not give her light 13 25 and the star 
of heaven shall fall and the power that are in heaven shall be 
shaken 

13 26 and then shall they see the son of man come in the cloud with 
great power and glori 

13 27 and then shall he send hi angel and shall gather togeth hi 
elect from the four wind from the uttermost part of the earth to the 
uttermost part of heaven 

13 28 now learn a parabl of the fig tree when her branch is yet 
tender and putteth forth leaf ye know that summer is near 13 29 
so ye in like manner when ye shall see these thing come to pa 
know that it is nigh even at the door 

13 30 verili i say unto you that thi gener shall not pa till 
all these thing be done 

13 31 heaven and earth shall pa away but my word shall not pa 
away 

13 32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angel 
which are in heaven neither the son but the father 

13 33 take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is 

13 34 for the son of man is a a man take a far journey who left 
hi hou and gave author to hi servant and to everi man hi 
work and command the porter to watch 

13 35 watch ye therefor for ye know not when the master of the hou 
cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrow or in the 
morn 13 36 lest come suddenli he find you sleep 

13 37 and what i say unto you i say unto all watch 

14 1 after two day wa the feast of the passov and of unleaven 
bread and the chief priest and the scribe sought how they might 
take him by craft and put him to death 

14 2 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of

spikenard veri preciou and she brake the box and pour it on hi 
head 

14 4 and there were some that had indign within themselv and 
said whi wa thi wast of the ointment made 14 5 for it might have 
been sold for more than three hundr penni and have been given to 
the poor and they murmur against her 

14 6 and jesu said let her alon whi troubl ye her she hath 
wrought a good work on me 

14 7 for ye have the poor with you alway and whensoev ye will ye 
may do them good but me ye have not alway 

14 8 she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my 
bodi to the buri 

14 9 verili i say unto you wheresoev thi gospel shall be preach 
throughout the whole world thi also that she hath done shall be 
spoken of for a memori of her 

14 10 and juda iscariot one of the twelv went unto the chief 
priest to betray him unto them 

14 11 and when they heard it they were glad and promi to give him 
money and he sought how he might conveni betray him 

14 12 and the first day of unleaven bread when they kill the 
passov hi discipl said unto him where wilt thou that we go and 
prepar that thou mayest eat the passov 14 13 and he sendeth forth 
two of hi discipl and saith unto them go ye into the citi and 
there shall meet you a man bear a pitcher of water follow him 

14 14 and wheresoev he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the 
hou the master saith where is the guestchamb where i shall eat 
the passov with my discipl 14 15 and he will shew you a larg 
upper room furnish and prepar there make readi for u 

14 16 and hi discipl went forth and came into the citi and found 
a he had said unto them and they made readi the passov 

14 17 and in the even he cometh with the twelv 

14 18 and a they sat and did eat jesu said verili i say unto you 
one of you which eateth with me shall betray me 

14 19 and they began to be sorrow and to say unto him one by one

unto them it is one of the twelv that dippeth with me in the dish 

14 21 the son of man ind goeth a it is written of him but woe to 
that man by whom the son of man is betray good were it for that man 
if he had never been born 

14 22 and a they did eat jesu took bread and bless and brake 
it and gave to them and said take eat thi is my bodi 

14 23 and he took the cup and when he had given thank he gave it to 
them and they all drank of it 

14 24 and he said unto them thi is my blood of the new testament 
which is shed for mani 

14 25 verili i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the 
vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god 

14 26 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of 
oliv 

14 27 and jesu saith unto them all ye shall be offend becau of 
me thi night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the 
sheep shall be scatter 

14 28 but after that i am risen i will go befor you into galil 

14 29 but peter said unto him although all shall be offend yet 
will not i 

14 30 and jesu saith unto him verili i say unto thee that thi day 
even in thi night befor the cock crow twice thou shalt deni me 
thrice 

14 31 but he spake the more vehement if i should die with thee i

14 32 and they came to a place which wa name gethseman and he 
saith to hi discipl sit ye here while i shall pray

14 36 and he said abba father all thing are possibl unto thee 
take away thi cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what

14 37 and he cometh and findeth them sleep and saith unto peter 
simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour 14 38 watch

but the flesh is weak 

14 39 and again he went away and pray and spake the same word 

14 40 and when he return he found them asleep again for their

4 42 and when it wa day he depart and went into a desert place 
and the peopl sought him and came unto him and stay him that he 
should not depart from them 

4 43 and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other 
citi also for therefor am i sent 

4 44 and he preach in the synagogu of galil 

5 1 and it came to pa that a the peopl press upon him to hear 
the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret 5 2 and saw two

and were wash their net 

5 3 and he enter into one of the ship which wa simon s and

of the fish which they had taken 5 10 and so wa also jame and 
john the son of zebed which were partner with simon and jesu 
said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men

5 15 but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great 
multitud came togeth to hear and to be heal by him of their 
infirm 

5 16 and he withdrew himself into the wilder and pray 

5 17 and it came to pa on a certain day a he wa teach that 
there were pharis and doctor of the law sit by which were 
come out of everi town of galil and judaea and jerusalem and the 
power of the lord wa present to heal them 

5 18 and behold men brought in a bed a man which wa taken with a 
palsi and they sought mean to bring him in and to lay him befor 
him 

5 19 and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in 
becau of the multitud they went upon the housetop and let him 
down through the tile with hi couch into the midst befor jesu 

5 20 and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thi sin are 
forgiven thee 

5 21 and the scribe and the pharis began to reason say who is 
thi which speaketh blasphemi who can forgiv sin but god alon 
5 22 but when jesu perceiv their thought he answer said unto 
them what reason ye in your heart 5 23 whether is easier to say 
thi sin be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk 5 24 but that 
ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgiv sin 
he said unto the sick of the palsi i say unto thee ari and take 
up thi couch and go into thine hou 

5 25 and immedi he rose up befor them and took up that whereon 
he lay and depart to hi own hou glorifi god 

5 26 and they were all amaz and they glorifi god and were fill 
with fear say we have seen strang thing to day 

5 27 and after these thing he went forth and saw a publican name 
levi sit at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow 
me 

5 28 and he left all rose up and follow him 

5 29 and levi made him a great feast in hi own hou and there wa a 
great compani of publican and of other that sat down with them 

5 30 but their scribe and pharis murmur against hi discipl 
say whi do ye eat and drink with publican and sinner 5 31 and 
jesu answer said unto them they that are whole need not a 
physician but they that are sick 

5 32 i came not to call the righteou but sinner to repent 

5 33 and they said unto him whi do the discipl of john fast often 
and make prayer and likewi the discipl of the pharis but 
thine eat and drink 5 34 and he said unto them can ye make the 
child of the bridechamb fast while the bridegroom is with them 
5 35 but the day will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away 
from them and then shall they fast in those day 

5 36 and he spake also a parabl unto them no man putteth a piec of 
a new garment upon an old if otherwi then both the new maketh a 
rent and the piec that wa taken out of the new agreeth not with the 
old 

5 37 and no man putteth new wine into old bottl el the new wine 
will burst the bottl and be spill and the bottl shall perish 

5 38 but new wine must be put into new bottl and both are 
preserv 

5 39 no man also have drunk old wine straightway desireth new for 
he saith the old is better 

6 1 and it came to pa on the second sabbath after the first that he 
went through the corn field and hi discipl pluck the ear of 
corn and did eat rub them in their hand 

6 2 and certain of the pharis said unto them whi do ye that which 
is not law to do on the sabbath day 6 3 and jesu answer them 
said have ye not read so much a thi what david did when himself 
wa an hungr and they which were with him 6 4 how he went into the 
hou of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to 
them that were with him which it is not law to eat but for the 
priest alon 6 5 and he said unto them that the son of man is lord 
also of the sabbath 

6 6 and it came to pa also on anoth sabbath that he enter into 
the synagogu and taught and there wa a man whose right hand wa 
wither 

6 7 and the scribe and pharis watch him whether he would heal 
on the sabbath day that they might find an accu against him 

6 8 but he knew their thought and said to the man which had the 
wither hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he aro and 
stood forth 

6 9 then said jesu unto them i will ask you one thing is it law 
on the sabbath day to do good or to do evil to save life or to 
destroy it 6 10 and look round about upon them all he said unto 
the man stretch forth thi hand and he did so and hi hand wa 
restor whole a the other 

6 11 and they were fill with mad and commun one with anoth 
what they might do to jesu 

6 12 and it came to pa in those day that he went out into a 
mountain to pray and continu all night in prayer to god 

6 13 and when it wa day he call unto him hi discipl and of 
them he chose twelv whom also he name apostl 6 14 simon whom 
he also name peter and andrew hi brother jame and john philip 
and bartholomew 6 15 matthew and thoma jame the son of alphaeu 
and simon call zelot 6 16 and juda the brother of jame and 
juda iscariot which also wa the traitor 

6 17 and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the 
compani of hi discipl and a great multitud of peopl out of all 
judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which 
came to hear him and to be heal of their disea 6 18 and they 
that were vex with unclean spirit and they were heal 

6 19 and the whole multitud sought to touch him for there went 
virtu out of him and heal them all 

6 20 and he lift up hi eye on hi discipl and said bless be 
ye poor for your is the kingdom of god 

6 21 bless are ye that hunger now for ye shall be fill bless 
are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh 

6 22 bless are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall 
separ you from their compani and shall reproach you and cast out 
your name a evil for the son of man s sake 

6 23 rejoic ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your 
reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their father 
unto the prophet 

6 24 but woe unto you that are rich for ye have receiv your 
consol 

6 25 woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you 
that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep 

6 26 woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did 
their father to the fal prophet 

6 27 but i say unto you which hear love your enemi do good to them 
which hate you 6 28 bless them that cur you and pray for them 
which despit use you 

6 29 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the 
other and him that taketh away thi cloak forbid not to take thi coat 
also 

6 30 give to everi man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh 
away thi good ask them not again 

6 31 and a ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them 
likewi 

6 32 for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for 
sinner also love those that love them 

6 33 and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have 
ye for sinner also do even the same 

6 34 and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiv what thank 
have ye for sinner also lend to sinner to receiv a much again 

6 35 but love ye your enemi and do good and lend hope for 
noth again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the 
child of the highest for he is kind unto the unthank and to the 
evil 

6 36 be ye therefor merci a your father also is merci 

6 37 judg not and ye shall not be judg condemn not and ye shall 
not be condemn forgiv and ye shall be forgiven 6 38 give and it 
shall be given unto you good measur press down and shaken 
togeth and run over shall men give into your bosom for with 
the same measur that ye mete withal it shall be measur to you 
again 

6 39 and he spake a parabl unto them can the blind lead the blind 
shall they not both fall into the ditch 6 40 the discipl is not 
abov hi master but everi one that is perfect shall be a hi 
master 

6 41 and whi beholdest thou the mote that is in thi brother s eye but 
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye 6 42 either how 
canst thou say to thi brother brother let me pull out the mote that 
is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in 
thine own eye thou hypocrit cast out first the beam out of thine 
own eye and then shalt thou see clearli to pull out the mote that is 
in thi brother s eye 

6 43 for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a 
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit 

6 44 for everi tree is known by hi own fruit for of thorn men do 
not gather fig nor of a brambl bush gather they grape 

6 45 a good man out of the good treasur of hi heart bringeth forth 
that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasur of hi 
heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abund of the 
heart hi mouth speaketh 

6 46 and whi call ye me lord lord and do not the thing which i 
say 6 47 whosoev cometh to me and heareth my say and doeth 
them i will shew you to whom he is like 6 48 he is like a man which 
built an hou and dig deep and laid the foundat on a rock 
and when the flood aro the stream beat vehement upon that hou 
and could not shake it for it wa found upon a rock 

6 49 but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a 
foundat built an hou upon the earth against which the stream did 
beat vehement and immedi it fell and the ruin of that hou 
wa great 

7 1 now when he had end all hi say in the audienc of the 
peopl he enter into capernaum 

7 2 and a certain centurion s servant who wa dear unto him wa 
sick and readi to die 

7 3 and when he heard of jesu he sent unto him the elder of the 
jew beseech him that he would come and heal hi servant 

7 4 and when they came to jesu they besought him instantli say 
that he wa worthi for whom he should do thi 7 5 for he loveth our 
nation and he hath built u a synagogu 

7 6 then jesu went with them and when he wa now not far from the 
hou the centurion sent friend to him say unto him lord 
troubl not thyself for i am not worthi that thou shouldest enter 
under my roof 7 7 wherefor neither thought i myself worthi to come 
unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be heal 

7 8 for i also am a man set under author have under me soldier 
and i say unto one go and he goeth and to anoth come and he 
cometh and to my servant do thi and he doeth it 

7 9 when jesu heard these thing he marvel at him and turn him 
about and said unto the peopl that follow him i say unto you i 
have not found so great faith no not in israel 

7 10 and they that were sent return to the hou found the 
servant whole that had been sick 

7 11 and it came to pa the day after that he went into a citi 
call nain and mani of hi discipl went with him and much peopl 

7 12 now when he came nigh to the gate of the citi behold there wa 
a dead man carri out the onli son of hi mother and she wa a 
widow and much peopl of the citi wa with her 

7 13 and when the lord saw her he had compass on her and said 
unto her weep not 

7 14 and he came and touch the bier and they that bare him stood 
still 

and he said young man i say unto thee ari 

7 15 and he that wa dead sat up and began to speak and he deliv 
him to hi mother 

7 16 and there came a fear on all and they glorifi god say 
that a great prophet is risen up among u and that god hath visit 
hi peopl 

7 17 and thi rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and 
throughout all the region round about 

7 18 and the discipl of john shew him of all these thing 

7 19 and john call unto him two of hi discipl sent them to 
jesu say art thou he that should come or look we for anoth 
7 20 when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath 
sent u unto thee say art thou he that should come or look we 
for anoth 7 21 and in that same hour he cure mani of their 
infirm and plagu and of evil spirit and unto mani that were 
blind he gave sight 

7 22 then jesu answer said unto them go your way and tell john 
what thing ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame 
walk the leper are clean the deaf hear the dead are rai to 
the poor the gospel is preach 

7 23 and bless is he whosoev shall not be offend in me 

7 24 and when the messeng of john were depart he began to speak 
unto the peopl concern john what went ye out into the wilder 
for to see a reed shaken with the wind 7 25 but what went ye out 
for to see a man cloth in soft raiment behold they which are 
gorgeou apparel and live delic are in king court 

7 26 but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you 
and much more than a prophet 

7 27 thi is he of whom it is written behold i send my messeng 
befor thi face which shall prepar thi way befor thee 

7 28 for i say unto you among those that are born of woman there is 
not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in 
the kingdom of god is greater than he 

7 29 and all the peopl that heard him and the publican justifi 
god be baptiz with the baptism of john 

7 30 but the pharis and lawyer reject the counsel of god against 
themselv be not baptiz of him 

7 31 and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of thi 
gener and to what are they like 7 32 they are like unto 
child sit in the marketplac and call one to anoth and 
say we have pipe unto you and ye have not danc we have 
mourn to you and ye have not wept 

7 33 for john the baptist came neither eat bread nor drink wine 
and ye say he hath a devil 

7 34 the son of man is come eat and drink and ye say behold a 
glutton man and a winebibb a friend of publican and sinner 
7 35 but wisdom is justifi of all her child 

7 36 and one of the pharis desir him that he would eat with him 
and he went into the pharis s hou and sat down to meat 

7 37 and behold a woman in the citi which wa a sinner when she 
knew that jesu sat at meat in the pharis s hou brought an 
alabast box of ointment 7 38 and stood at hi foot behind him 
weep and began to wash hi foot with tear and did wipe them with 
the hair of her head and kiss hi foot and anoint them with the 
ointment 

7 39 now when the pharis which had bidden him saw it he spake 
within himself say thi man if he were a prophet would have 
known who and what manner of woman thi is that toucheth him for she 
is a sinner 

7 40 and jesu answer said unto him simon i have somewhat to say 
unto thee and he saith master say on 

7 41 there wa a certain creditor which had two debtor the one owe 
five hundr penni and the other fifti 

7 42 and when they had noth to pay he frankli forgav them both 
tell me therefor which of them will love him most 7 43 simon 
answer and said i suppo that he to whom he forgav most 

and he said unto him thou hast rightli judg 

7 44 and he turn to the woman and said unto simon seest thou thi 
woman i enter into thine hou thou gavest me no water for my 
foot but she hath wash my foot with tear and wipe them with the 
hair of her head 

7 45 thou gavest me no kiss but thi woman sinc the time i came in 
hath not cea to kiss my foot 

7 46 my head with oil thou didst not anoint but thi woman hath 
anoint my foot with ointment 

7 47 wherefor i say unto thee her sin which are mani are 
forgiven for she love much but to whom littl is forgiven the same 
loveth littl 

7 48 and he said unto her thi sin are forgiven 

7 49 and they that sat at meat with him began to say within 
themselv who is thi that forgiveth sin also 7 50 and he said to 
the woman thi faith hath save thee go in peac 

8 1 and it came to pa afterward that he went throughout everi citi 
and villag preach and shew the glad tide of the kingdom of 
god and the twelv were with him 8 2 and certain woman which had 
been heal of evil spirit and infirm mari call magdalen 
out of whom went seven devil 8 3 and joanna the wife of chuza 
herod s steward and susanna and mani other which minist unto 
him of their substanc 

8 4 and when much peopl were gather togeth and were come to him 
out of everi citi he spake by a parabl 8 5 a sower went out to sow 
hi seed and a he sow some fell by the way side and it wa 
trodden down and the fowl of the air devour it 

8 6 and some fell upon a rock and a soon a it wa sprung up it 
wither away becau it lack moistur 

8 7 and some fell among thorn and the thorn sprang up with it and 
choke it 

8 8 and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an 
hundredfold and when he had said these thing he cri he that hath 
ear to hear let him hear 

8 9 and hi discipl ask him say what might thi parabl be 
8 10 and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteri of the 
kingdom of god but to other in parabl that see they might not 
see and hear they might not understand 

8 11 now the parabl is thi the seed is the word of god 

8 12 those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil 
and taketh away the word out of their heart lest they should believ 
and be save 

8 13 they on the rock are they which when they hear receiv the 
word with joy and these have no root which for a while believ and 
in time of temptat fall away 

8 14 and that which fell among thorn are they which when they have 
heard go forth and are choke with care and rich and pleasur of 
thi life and bring no fruit to perfect 

8 15 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good 
heart have heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with 
patienc 

8 16 no man when he hath light a candl covereth it with a vessel 
or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they 
which enter in may see the light 

8 17 for noth is secret that shall not be made manifest neither 
ani thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad 

8 18 take heed therefor how ye hear for whosoev hath to him shall 
be given and whosoev hath not from him shall be taken even that 
which he seemeth to have 

8 19 then came to him hi mother and hi brother and could not come 
at him for the press 

8 20 and it wa told him by certain which said thi mother and thi 
brother stand without desir to see thee 

8 21 and he answer and said unto them my mother and my brother are 
these which hear the word of god and do it 

8 22 now it came to pa on a certain day that he went into a ship 
with hi discipl and he said unto them let u go over unto the 
other side of the lake and they launch forth 

8 23 but a they sail he fell asleep and there came down a storm of 
wind on the lake and they were fill with water and were in 
jeopardi 

8 24 and they came to him and awok him say master master we 
perish then he aro and rebuk the wind and the rage of the 
water and they cea and there wa a calm 

8 25 and he said unto them where is your faith and they be afraid 
wonder say one to anoth what manner of man is thi for he 
commandeth even the wind and water and they obey him 

8 26 and they arriv at the countri of the gadaren which is over 
against galil 

8 27 and when he went forth to land there met him out of the citi a 
certain man which had devil long time and ware no cloth neither 
abod in ani hou but in the tomb 

8 28 when he saw jesu he cri out and fell down befor him and 
with a loud voic said what have i to do with thee jesu thou son 
of god most high i beseech thee torment me not 

8 29 for he had command the unclean spirit to come out of the man 
for oftentim it had caught him and he wa kept bound with chain 
and in fetter and he brake the band and wa driven of the devil 
into the wilder 8 30 and jesu ask him say what is thi 
name and he said legion becau mani devil were enter into him 

8 31 and they besought him that he would not command them to go out 
into the deep 

8 32 and there wa there an herd of mani swine feed on the 
mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter 
into them and he suffer them 

8 33 then went the devil out of the man and enter into the swine 
and the herd ran violent down a steep place into the lake and were 
choke 

8 34 when they that fed them saw what wa done they fled and went 
and told it in the citi and in the countri 

8 35 then they went out to see what wa done and came to jesu and 
found the man out of whom the devil were depart sit at the 
foot of jesu cloth and in hi right mind and they were afraid 

8 36 they also which saw it told them by what mean he that wa 
poss of the devil wa heal 

8 37 then the whole multitud of the countri of the gadaren round 
about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great 
fear and he went up into the ship and return back again 

8 38 now the man out of whom the devil were depart besought him 
that he might be with him but jesu sent him away say 8 39 
return to thine own hou and shew how great thing god hath done 
unto thee and he went hi way and publish throughout the whole 
citi how great thing jesu had done unto him 

8 40 and it came to pa that when jesu wa return the peopl 
gladli receiv him for they were all wait for him 

8 41 and behold there came a man name jairu and he wa a ruler of 
the synagogu and he fell down at jesu foot and besought him that 
he would come into hi hou 8 42 for he had one onli daughter about 
twelv year of age and she lay a die but a he went the peopl 
throng him 

8 43 and a woman have an issu of blood twelv year which had 
spent all her live upon physician neither could be heal of ani 
8 44 came behind him and touch the border of hi garment and 
immedi her issu of blood stanch 

8 45 and jesu said who touch me when all deni peter and they 
that were with him said master the multitud throng thee and press 
thee and sayest thou who touch me 8 46 and jesu said somebodi 
hath touch me for i perceiv that virtu is gone out of me 

8 47 and when the woman saw that she wa not hid she came trembl 
and fall down befor him she declar unto him befor all the

should accomplish at jerusalem 

9 32 but peter and they that were with him were heavi with sleep and 
when they were awak they saw hi glori and the two men that stood

9 33 and it came to pa a they depart from him peter said unto 
jesu master it is good for u to be here and let u make three 
tabernacl one for thee and one for mose and one for elia not 
know what he said 

9 34 while he thu spake there came a cloud and overshadow them 
and they fear a they enter into the cloud 

9 35 and there came a voic out of the cloud say thi is my 
belov son hear him 

9 36 and when the voic wa past jesu wa found alon and they kept 
it close and told no man in those day ani of those thing which they

9 37 and it came to pa that on the next day when they were come 
down from the hill much peopl met him 

9 38 and behold a man of the compani cri out say master i 
beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine onli child 

9 39 and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenli crieth out and it 
teareth him that he foameth again and brui him hardli departeth 
from him 

9 40 and i besought thi discipl to cast him out and they could not 

9 41 and jesu answer said o faithless and perver gener 
how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thi son hither 

9 42 and a he wa yet a come the devil threw him down and tare 
him 

and jesu rebuk the unclean spirit and heal the child and 
deliv him again to hi father 

9 43 and they were all amaz at the mighti power of god but while 
they wonder everi one at all thing which jesu did he said unto 
hi discipl 9 44 let these say sink down into your ear for 
the son of man shall be deliv into the hand of men 

9 45 but they understood not thi say and it wa hid from them 
that they perceiv it not and they fear to ask him of that say 

9 46 then there aro a reason among them which of them should be 
greatest 

9 47 and jesu perceiv the thought of their heart took a child 
and set him by him 9 48 and said unto them whosoev shall receiv 
thi child in my name receiveth me and whosoev shall receiv me 
receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the 
same shall be great 

9 49 and john answer and said master we saw one cast out devil 
in thi name and we forbad him becau he followeth not with u 

9 50 and jesu said unto him forbid him not for he that is not 
against u is for u 

9 51 and it came to pa when the time wa come that he should be 
receiv up he stedfastli set hi face to go to jerusalem 9 52 and 
sent messeng befor hi face and they went and enter into a 
villag of the samaritan to make readi for him 

9 53 and they did not receiv him becau hi face wa a though he 
would go to jerusalem 

9 54 and when hi discipl jame and john saw thi they said lord 
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consum 
them even a elia did 9 55 but he turn and rebuk them and 
said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of 

9 56 for the son of man is not come to destroy men s life but to 
save them and they went to anoth villag 

9 57 and it came to pa that a they went in the way a certain man 
said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoev thou goest 

9 58 and jesu said unto him fox have hole and bird of the air 
have nest but the son of man hath not where to lay hi head 

9 59 and he said unto anoth follow me but he said lord suffer me 
first to go and buri my father 

9 60 jesu said unto him let the dead buri their dead but go thou 
and preach the kingdom of god 

9 61 and anoth also said lord i will follow thee but let me first 
go bid them farewel which are at home at my hou 

9 62 and jesu said unto him no man have put hi hand to the 
plough and look back is fit for the kingdom of god 

10 1 after these thing the lord appoint other seventi also and 
sent them two and two befor hi face into everi citi and place 
whither he himself would come 

10 2 therefor said he unto them the harvest truli is great but the 
labour are few pray ye therefor the lord of the harvest that he 
would send forth labour into hi harvest 

10 3 go your way behold i send you forth a lamb among wolf 

10 4 carri neither pur nor scrip nor shoe and salut no man by 
the way 

10 5 and into whatsoev hou ye enter first say peac be to thi 
hou 

10 6 and if the son of peac be there your peac shall rest upon it 
if not it shall turn to you again 

10 7 and in the same hou remain eat and drink such thing a 
they give for the labour is worthi of hi hire go not from hou 
to hou 

10 8 and into whatsoev citi ye enter and they receiv you eat such 
thing a are set befor you 10 9 and heal the sick that are therein 
and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you 

10 10 but into whatsoev citi ye enter and they receiv you not go 
your way out into the street of the same and say 10 11 even the 
veri dust of your citi which cleaveth on u we do wipe off against 
you notwithstand be ye sure of thi that the kingdom of god is 
come nigh unto you 

10 12 but i say unto you that it shall be more toler in that day 
for sodom than for that citi 

10 13 woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the 
mighti work had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in 
you they had a great while ago repent sit in sackcloth and 
ash 

10 14 but it shall be more toler for tyre and sidon at the 
judgment than for you 

10 15 and thou capernaum which art exalt to heaven shalt be 
thrust down to hell 

10 16 he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you 
despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me 

10 17 and the seventi return again with joy say lord even the 
devil are subject unto u through thi name 

10 18 and he said unto them i beheld satan a lightn fall from 
heaven 

10 19 behold i give unto you power to tread on serpent and 
scorpion and over all the power of the enemi and noth shall by 
ani mean hurt you 

10 20 notwithstand in thi rejoic not that the spirit are 
subject unto you but rather rejoic becau your name are written 
in heaven 

10 21 in that hour jesu rejoic in spirit and said i thank thee o 
father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these thing from 
the wise and prudent and hast reveal them unto babe even so 
father for so it seem good in thi sight 

10 22 all thing are deliv to me of my father and no man knoweth 
who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son 
and he to whom the son will reveal him 

10 23 and he turn him unto hi discipl and said privat 
bless are the eye which see the thing that ye see 10 24 for i 
tell you that mani prophet and king have desir to see those 
thing which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those thing 
which ye hear and have not heard them 

10 25 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempt him say 
master what shall i do to inherit etern life 10 26 he said unto 
him what is written in the law how readest thou 10 27 and he 
answer said thou shalt love the lord thi god with all thi heart 
and with all thi soul and with all thi strength and with all thi 
mind and thi neighbour a thyself 

10 28 and he said unto him thou hast answer right thi do and 
thou shalt live 

10 29 but he will to justifi himself said unto jesu and who is 
my neighbour 10 30 and jesu answer said a certain man went down 
from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thief which strip him 
of hi raiment and wound him and depart leav him half dead 

10 31 and by chanc there came down a certain priest that way and 
when he saw him he pa by on the other side 

10 32 and likewi a levit when he wa at the place came and look 
on him and pa by on the other side 

10 33 but a certain samaritan a he journey came where he wa and 
when he saw him he had compass on him 10 34 and went to him and 
bound up hi wound pour in oil and wine and set him on hi own 
beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him 

10 35 and on the morrow when he depart he took out two penni and 
gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and 
whatsoev thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee 

10 36 which now of these three thinkest thou wa neighbour unto him 
that fell among the thief 10 37 and he said he that shew merci 
on him then said jesu unto him go and do thou likewi 

10 38 now it came to pa a they went that he enter into a 
certain villag and a certain woman name martha receiv him into 
her hou 

10 39 and she had a sister call mari which also sat at jesu foot 
and heard hi word 

10 40 but martha wa cumber about much serv and came to him and 
said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serv 
alon bid her therefor that she help me 

10 41 and jesu answer and said unto her martha martha thou art 
care and troubl about mani thing 10 42 but one thing is 
need and mari hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken 
away from her 

11 1 and it came to pa that a he wa pray in a certain place 
when he cea one of hi discipl said unto him lord teach u to 
pray a john also taught hi discipl 

11 2 and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in 
heaven hallow be thi name thi kingdom come thi will be done a 
in heaven so in earth 

11 3 give u day by day our daili bread 

11 4 and forgiv u our sin for we also forgiv everi one that is 
indebt to u and lead u not into temptat but deliv u from 
evil 

11 5 and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and 
shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three 
loaf 11 6 for a friend of mine in hi journey is come to me and i 
have noth to set befor him 11 7 and he from within shall answer 
and say troubl me not the door is now shut and my child are 
with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee 

11 8 i say unto you though he will not rise and give him becau he 
is hi friend yet becau of hi importun he will rise and give 
him a mani a he needeth 

11 9 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye 
shall find knock and it shall be open unto you 

11 10 for everi one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh 
findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open 

11 11 if a son shall ask bread of ani of you that is a father will he 
give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a 
serpent 11 12 or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a 
scorpion 11 13 if ye then be evil know how to give good gift 
unto your child how much more shall your heavenli father give the 
holi spirit to them that ask him 11 14 and he wa cast out a 
devil and it wa dumb and it came to pa when the devil wa gone 
out the dumb spake and the peopl wonder 

11 15 but some of them said he casteth out devil through beelzebub 
the chief of the devil 

11 16 and other tempt him sought of him a sign from heaven 

11 17 but he know their thought said unto them everi kingdom 
divid against itself is brought to desol and a hou divid 
against a hou falleth 

11 18 if satan also be divid against himself how shall hi kingdom 
stand becau ye say that i cast out devil through beelzebub 

11 19 and if i by beelzebub cast out devil by whom do your son cast 
them out therefor shall they be your judg 

11 20 but if i with the finger of god cast out devil no doubt the 
kingdom of god is come upon you 

11 21 when a strong man arm keepeth hi palac hi good are in 
peac 11 22 but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and 
overcom him he taketh from him all hi armour wherein he trust 
and divideth hi spoil 

11 23 he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not 
with me scattereth 

11 24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through 
dri place seek rest and find none he saith i will return 
unto my hou whenc i came out 

11 25 and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnish 

11 26 then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirit more wick 
than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state 
of that man is wor than the first 

11 27 and it came to pa a he spake these thing a certain woman 
of the compani lift up her voic and said unto him bless is the 
womb that bare thee and the pap which thou hast suck 

11 28 but he said yea rather bless are they that hear the word of 
god and keep it 

11 29 and when the peopl were gather thick togeth he began to 
say thi is an evil gener they seek a sign and there shall no 
sign be given it but the sign of jona the prophet 

11 30 for a jona wa a sign unto the ninevit so shall also the 
son of man be to thi gener 

11 31 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the 
men of thi gener and condemn them for she came from the utmost 
part of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a 
greater than solomon is here 

11 32 the men of ninev shall rise up in the judgment with thi 
gener and shall condemn it for they repent at the preach 
of jona and behold a greater than jona is here 

11 33 no man when he hath light a candl putteth it in a secret 
place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which 
come in may see the light 

11 34 the light of the bodi is the eye therefor when thine eye is 
singl thi whole bodi also is full of light but when thine eye is 
evil thi bodi also is full of dark 

11 35 take heed therefor that the light which is in thee be not 
dark 

11 36 if thi whole bodi therefor be full of light have no part 
dark the whole shall be full of light a when the bright shine of 
a candl doth give thee light 

11 37 and a he spake a certain pharis besought him to dine with 
him and he went in and sat down to meat 

11 38 and when the pharis saw it he marvel that he had not first 
wash befor dinner 

11 39 and the lord said unto him now do ye pharis make clean the 
outsid of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of 
raven and wick 

11 40 ye fool did not he that made that which is without make that 
which is within also 11 41 but rather give alm of such thing a ye 
have and behold all thing are clean unto you 

11 42 but woe unto you pharis for ye tith mint and rue and all 
manner of herb and pa over judgment and the love of god these 
ought ye to have done and not to leav the other undon 

11 43 woe unto you pharis for ye love the uppermost seat in the 
synagogu and greet in the market 

11 44 woe unto you scribe and pharis hypocrit for ye are a 
graf which appear not and the men that walk over them are not awar 
of them 

11 45 then answer one of the lawyer and said unto him master 
thu say thou reproachest u also 

11 46 and he said woe unto you also ye lawyer for ye lade men with 
burden grievou to be born and ye yourselv touch not the burden 
with one of your finger 

11 47 woe unto you for ye build the sepulchr of the prophet and 
your father kill them 

11 48 truli ye bear wit that ye allow the deed of your father 
for they ind kill them and ye build their sepulchr 

11 49 therefor also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophet 
and apostl and some of them they shall slay and persecut 11 50 
that the blood of all the prophet which wa shed from the foundat 
of the world may be requir of thi gener 11 51 from the blood 
of abel unto the blood of zacharia which perish between the altar 
and the templ verili i say unto you it shall be requir of thi 
gener 

11 52 woe unto you lawyer for ye have taken away the key of 
knowledg ye enter not in yourselv and them that were enter 
in ye hinder 

11 53 and a he said these thing unto them the scribe and the 
pharis began to urg him vehement and to provok him to speak of 
mani thing 11 54 lay wait for him and seek to catch someth 
out of hi mouth that they might accu him 

12 1 in the mean time when there were gather togeth an 
innum multitud of peopl insomuch that they trode one upon 
anoth he began to say unto hi discipl first of all bewar ye of 
the leaven of the pharis which is hypocrisi 

12 2 for there is noth cover that shall not be reveal neither 
hid that shall not be known 

12 3 therefor whatsoev ye have spoken in dark shall be heard in 
the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closet shall 
be proclaim upon the housetop 

12 4 and i say unto you my friend be not afraid of them that kill 
the bodi and after that have no more that they can do 

12 5 but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after 
he hath kill hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear 
him 

12 6 are not five sparrow sold for two farth and not one of them 
is forgotten befor god 12 7 but even the veri hair of your head 
are all number fear not therefor ye are of more valu than mani 
sparrow 

12 8 also i say unto you whosoev shall confess me befor men him 
shall the son of man also confess befor the angel of god 12 9 but 
he that denieth me befor men shall be deni befor the angel of 
god 

12 10 and whosoev shall speak a word against the son of man it 
shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holi 
ghost it shall not be forgiven 

12 11 and when they bring you unto the synagogu and unto 
magistr and power take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall 
answer or what ye shall say 12 12 for the holi ghost shall teach you 
in the same hour what ye ought to say 

12 13 and one of the compani said unto him master speak to my 
brother that he divid the inherit with me 

12 14 and he said unto him man who made me a judg or a divid over 
you 12 15 and he said unto them take heed and bewar of 
covet for a man s life consisteth not in the abund of the 
thing which he possesseth 

12 16 and he spake a parabl unto them say the ground of a 
certain rich man brought forth plenti 12 17 and he thought 
within himself say what shall i do becau i have no room where 
to bestow my fruit 12 18 and he said thi will i do i will pull 
down my barn and build greater and there will i bestow all my 
fruit and my good 

12 19 and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much good laid up 
for mani year take thine ea eat drink and be merri 

12 20 but god said unto him thou fool thi night thi soul shall be 
requir of thee then whose shall those thing be which thou hast 
provid 12 21 so is he that layeth up treasur for himself and is 
not rich toward god 

12 22 and he said unto hi discipl therefor i say unto you take 
no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the bodi 
what ye shall put on 

12 23 the life is more than meat and the bodi is more than raiment 

12 24 consid the raven for they neither sow nor reap which 
neither have storeh nor barn and god feedeth them how much more 
are ye better than the fowl 12 25 and which of you with take 
thought can add to hi statur one cubit 12 26 if ye then be not 
abl to do that thing which is least whi take ye thought for the 
rest 12 27 consid the lili how they grow they toil not they 
spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all hi glori wa 
not array like one of these 

12 28 if then god so cloth the grass which is to day in the field 
and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he cloth you 
o ye of littl faith 12 29 and seek not ye what ye shall eat or 
what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubt mind 

12 30 for all these thing do the nation of the world seek after and 
your father knoweth that ye have need of these thing 

12 31 but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these thing 
shall be ad unto you 

12 32 fear not littl flock for it is your father s good pleasur to 
give you the kingdom 

12 33 sell that ye have and give alm provid yourselv bag which 
wax not old a treasur in the heaven that faileth not where no 
thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth 

12 34 for where your treasur is there will your heart be also 

12 35 let your loin be gird about and your light burn 12 36 
and ye yourselv like unto men that wait for their lord when he will 
return from the wed that when he cometh and knocketh they may 
open unto him immedi 

12 37 bless are those servant whom the lord when he cometh shall 
find watch verili i say unto you that he shall gird himself and 
make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serv them 

12 38 and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third 
watch and find them so bless are those servant 

12 39 and thi know that if the goodman of the hou had known what 
hour the thief would come he would have watch and not have 
suffer hi hou to be broken through 

12 40 be ye therefor readi also for the son of man cometh at an hour 
when ye think not 

12 41 then peter said unto him lord speakest thou thi parabl unto 
u or even to all 12 42 and the lord said who then is that 
faith and wise steward whom hi lord shall make ruler over hi 
household to give them their portion of meat in due season 12 43 
bless is that servant whom hi lord when he cometh shall find so 
do 

12 44 of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all 
that he hath 

12 45 but and if that servant say in hi heart my lord delayeth hi 
come and shall begin to beat the manserv and maiden and to 
eat and drink and to be drunken 12 46 the lord of that servant will 
come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is 
not awar and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him hi 
portion with the unbeliev 

12 47 and that servant which knew hi lord s will and prepar not 
himself neither did accord to hi will shall be beaten with mani 
stripe 

12 48 but he that knew not and did commit thing worthi of stripe 
shall be beaten with few stripe for unto whomsoev much is given 
of him shall be much requir and to whom men have commit much of 
him they will ask the more 

12 49 i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be 
alreadi kindl 12 50 but i have a baptism to be baptiz with and 
how am i straiten till it be accomplish 12 51 suppo ye that i 
am come to give peac on earth i tell you nay but rather divi 
12 52 for from henceforth there shall be five in one hou divid 
three against two and two against three 

12 53 the father shall be divid against the son and the son against 
the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against 
the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the 
daughter in law against her mother in law 

12 54 and he said also to the peopl when ye see a cloud rise out of 
the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is 

12 55 and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat 
and it cometh to pa 

12 56 ye hypocrit ye can discern the face of the sky and of the 
earth but how is it that ye do not discern thi time 12 57 yea and 
whi even of yourselv judg ye not what is right 12 58 when thou 
goest with thine adversari to the magistr a thou art in the way 
give dilig that thou mayest be deliv from him lest he hale 
thee to the judg and the judg deliv thee to the offic and the 
offic cast thee into prison 

12 59 i tell thee thou shalt not depart thenc till thou hast paid 
the veri last mite 

13 1 there were present at that season some that told him of the 
galilaean whose blood pilat had mingl with their sacrif 

13 2 and jesu answer said unto them suppo ye that these 
galilaean were sinner abov all the galilaean becau they 
suffer such thing 13 3 i tell you nay but except ye repent ye 
shall all likewi perish 

13 4 or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew 
them think ye that they were sinner abov all men that dwelt in 
jerusalem 13 5 i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all 
likewi perish 

13 6 he spake also thi parabl a certain man had a fig tree plant 
in hi vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none 

13 7 then said he unto the dresser of hi vineyard behold these 
three year i come seek fruit on thi fig tree and find none cut 
it down whi cumbereth it the ground 13 8 and he answer said unto 
him lord let it alon thi year also till i shall dig about it and 
dung it 13 9 and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that 
thou shalt cut it down 

13 10 and he wa teach in one of the synagogu on the sabbath 

13 11 and behold there wa a woman which had a spirit of infirm 
eighteen year and wa bow togeth and could in no wise lift up 
herself 

13 12 and when jesu saw her he call her to him and said unto her 
woman thou art loo from thine infirm 

13 13 and he laid hi hand on her and immedi she wa made 
straight and glorifi god 

13 14 and the ruler of the synagogu answer with indign 
becau that jesu had heal on the sabbath day and said unto the 
peopl there are six day in which men ought to work in them 
therefor come and be heal and not on the sabbath day 

13 15 the lord then answer him and said thou hypocrit doth not 
each one of you on the sabbath loo hi ox or hi a from the stall 
and lead him away to water 13 16 and ought not thi woman be 
a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen 
year be loo from thi bond on the sabbath day 13 17 and when he 
had said these thing all hi adversari were asham and all the 
peopl rejoic for all the gloriou thing that were done by him 

13 18 then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and 
whereunto shall i resembl it 13 19 it is like a grain of mustard 
seed which a man took and cast into hi garden and it grew and 
wax a great tree and the fowl of the air lodg in the branch of 
it 

13 20 and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god 
13 21 it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measur 
of meal till the whole wa leaven 

13 22 and he went through the citi and villag teach and 
journey toward jerusalem 

13 23 then said one unto him lord are there few that be save and 
he said unto them 13 24 strive to enter in at the strait gate for 
mani i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be abl 

13 25 when onc the master of the hou is risen up and hath shut to 
the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door 
say lord lord open unto u and he shall answer and say unto 
you i know you not whenc ye are 13 26 then shall ye begin to say 
we have eaten and drunk in thi presenc and thou hast taught in our 
street 

13 27 but he shall say i tell you i know you not whenc ye are 
depart from me all ye worker of iniqu 

13 28 there shall be weep and gnash of teeth when ye shall see 
abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophet in the kingdom of 
god and you yourselv thrust out 

13 29 and they shall come from the east and from the west and from 
the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of 
god 

13 30 and behold there are last which shall be first and there are 
first which shall be last 

13 31 the same day there came certain of the pharis say unto 
him get thee out and depart henc for herod will kill thee 

13 32 and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast 
out devil and i do cure to day and to morrow and the third day i 
shall be perfect 

13 33 nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day 
follow for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem 

13 34 o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophet and stonest 
them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gather thi 
child togeth a a hen doth gather her brood under her wing and 
ye would not 13 35 behold your hou is left unto you desol and 
verili i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when 
ye shall say bless is he that cometh in the name of the lord 

14 1 and it came to pa a he went into the hou of one of the 
chief pharis to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watch 
him 

14 2 and behold there wa a certain man befor him which had the 
dropsi 

14 3 and jesu answer spake unto the lawyer and pharis say 
is it law to heal on the sabbath day 14 4 and they held their 
peac and he took him and heal him and let him go 14 5 and 
answer them say which of you shall have an a or an ox fallen 
into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day 
14 6 and they could not answer him again to these thing 

14 7 and he put forth a parabl to those which were bidden when he 
mark how they chose out the chief room say unto them 

14 8 when thou art bidden of ani man to a wed sit not down in the 
highest room lest a more honour man than thou be bidden of him 
14 9 and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give thi man 
place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room 

14 10 but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room 
that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go 
up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presenc of them that 
sit at meat with thee 

14 11 for whosoev exalteth himself shall be aba and he that 
humbleth himself shall be exalt 

14 12 then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a 
dinner or a supper call not thi friend nor thi brother neither 
thi kinsman nor thi rich neighbour lest they also bid thee again 
and a recomp be made thee 

14 13 but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maim the 
lame the blind 14 14 and thou shalt be bless for they cannot 
recompen thee for thou shalt be recompen at the resurrect of 
the just 

14 15 and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these 
thing he said unto him bless is he that shall eat bread in the 
kingdom of god 

14 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and 
bade mani 14 17 and sent hi servant at supper time to say to them 
that were bidden come for all thing are now readi 

14 18 and they all with one consent began to make excu the first 
said unto him i have bought a piec of ground and i must need go 
and see it i pray thee have me excu 

14 19 and anoth said i have bought five yoke of ox and i go to 
prove them i pray thee have me excu 

14 20 and anoth said i have marri a wife and therefor i cannot 
come 

14 21 so that servant came and shew hi lord these thing then the 
master of the hou be angri said to hi servant go out quickli 
into the street and lane of the citi and bring in hither the poor 
and the maim and the halt and the blind 

14 22 and the servant said lord it is done a thou hast command 
and yet there is room 

14 23 and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highway and 
hedg and compel them to come in that my hou may be fill 

14 24 for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden 
shall tast of my supper 

14 25 and there went great multitud with him and he turn and 
said unto them 14 26 if ani man come to me and hate not hi father 
and mother and wife and child and brother and sister yea 
and hi own life also he cannot be my discipl 

14 27 and whosoev doth not bear hi cross and come after me cannot 
be my discipl 

14 28 for which of you intend to build a tower sitteth not down 
first and counteth the cost whether he have suffici to finish it 
14 29 lest hapli after he hath laid the foundat and is not abl 
to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him 14 30 say thi 
man began to build and wa not abl to finish 

14 31 or what king go to make war against anoth king sitteth 
not down first and consulteth whether he be abl with ten thousand to 
meet him that cometh against him with twenti thousand 14 32 or el 
while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassag and 
desireth condit of peac 

14 33 so likewi whosoev he be of you that forsaketh not all that 
he hath he cannot be my discipl 

14 34 salt is good but if the salt have lost hi savour wherewith 
shall it be season 14 35 it is neither fit for the land nor yet 
for the dunghil but men cast it out he that hath ear to hear let 
him hear 

15 1 then drew near unto him all the publican and sinner for to hear 
him 

15 2 and the pharis and scribe murmur say thi man 
receiveth sinner and eateth with them 

15 3 and he spake thi parabl unto them say 15 4 what man of 
you have an hundr sheep if he lose one of them doth not leav 
the nineti and nine in the wilder and go after that which is 
lost until he find it 15 5 and when he hath found it he layeth it 
on hi shoulder rejoic 

15 6 and when he cometh home he calleth togeth hi friend and 
neighbour say unto them rejoic with me for i have found my 
sheep which wa lost 

15 7 i say unto you that likewi joy shall be in heaven over one 
sinner that repenteth more than over nineti and nine just person 
which need no repent 

15 8 either what woman have ten piec of silver if she lose one 
piec doth not light a candl and sweep the hou and seek 
dilig till she find it 15 9 and when she hath found it she 
calleth her friend and her neighbour togeth say rejoic with 
me for i have found the piec which i had lost 

15 10 likewi i say unto you there is joy in the presenc of the 
angel of god over one sinner that repenteth 

15 11 and he said a certain man had two son 15 12 and the younger 
of them said to hi father father give me the portion of good that 
falleth to me and he divid unto them hi live 

15 13 and not mani day after the younger son gather all togeth 
and took hi journey into a far countri and there wast hi 
substanc with riotou live 

15 14 and when he had spent all there aro a mighti famin in that 
land and he began to be in want 

15 15 and he went and join himself to a citizen of that countri and 
he sent him into hi field to feed swine 

15 16 and he would fain have fill hi belli with the husk that the 
swine did eat and no man gave unto him 

15 17 and when he came to himself he said how mani hire servant of 
my father s have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger 
15 18 i will ari and go to my father and will say unto him father 
i have sin against heaven and befor thee 15 19 and am no more 
worthi to be call thi son make me a one of thi hire servant 

15 20 and he aro and came to hi father but when he wa yet a 
great way off hi father saw him and had compass and ran and 
fell on hi neck and kiss him 

15 21 and the son said unto him father i have sin against heaven 
and in thi sight and am no more worthi to be call thi son 

15 22 but the father said to hi servant bring forth the best robe 
and put it on him and put a ring on hi hand and shoe on hi foot 
15 23 and bring hither the fat calf and kill it and let u eat 
and be merri 15 24 for thi my son wa dead and is aliv again he 
wa lost and is found and they began to be merri 

15 25 now hi elder son wa in the field and a he came and drew nigh 
to the hou he heard musick and danc 

15 26 and he call one of the servant and ask what these thing 
meant 

15 27 and he said unto him thi brother is come and thi father hath 
kill the fat calf becau he hath receiv him safe and sound 

15 28 and he wa angri and would not go in therefor came hi father 
out and intreat him 

15 29 and he answer said to hi father lo these mani year do i 
serv thee neither transgress i at ani time thi command and 
yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merri with my 
friend 15 30 but a soon a thi thi son wa come which hath 
devour thi live with harlot thou hast kill for him the fat 
calf 

15 31 and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i 
have is thine 

15 32 it wa meet that we should make merri and be glad for thi thi 
brother wa dead and is aliv again and wa lost and is found 

16 1 and he said also unto hi discipl there wa a certain rich 
man which had a steward and the same wa accu unto him that he 
had wast hi good 

16 2 and he call him and said unto him how is it that i hear thi 
of thee give an account of thi stewardship for thou mayest be no 
longer steward 

16 3 then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my 
lord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am 
asham 

16 4 i am resolv what to do that when i am put out of the 
stewardship they may receiv me into their hou 

16 5 so he call everi one of hi lord s debtor unto him and said 
unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord 16 6 and he said 
an hundr measur of oil and he said unto him take thi bill and 
sit down quickli and write fifti 

16 7 then said he to anoth and how much owest thou and he said an 
hundr measur of wheat and he said unto him take thi bill and 
write fourscor 

16 8 and the lord commend the unjust steward becau he had done 
wise for the child of thi world are in their gener wiser 
than the child of light 

16 9 and i say unto you make to yourselv friend of the mammon of 
unright that when ye fail they may receiv you into 
everlast habit 

16 10 he that is faith in that which is least is faith also in 
much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much 

16 11 if therefor ye have not been faith in the unright 
mammon who will commit to your trust the true rich 16 12 and if 
ye have not been faith in that which is anoth man s who shall 
give you that which is your own 16 13 no servant can serv two 
master for either he will hate the one and love the other or el 
he will hold to the one and despi the other ye cannot serv god 
and mammon 

16 14 and the pharis also who were covet heard all these 
thing and they derid him 

16 15 and he said unto them ye are they which justifi yourselv 
befor men but god knoweth your heart for that which is highli 
esteem among men is abomin in the sight of god 

16 16 the law and the prophet were until john sinc that time the 
kingdom of god is preach and everi man presseth into it 

16 17 and it is easier for heaven and earth to pa than one tittl 
of the law to fail 

16 18 whosoev putteth away hi wife and marrieth anoth 
committeth adulteri and whosoev marrieth her that is put away from 
her husband committeth adulteri 

16 19 there wa a certain rich man which wa cloth in purpl and 
fine linen and fare sumptuou everi day 16 20 and there wa a 
certain beggar name lazaru which wa laid at hi gate full of 
sore 16 21 and desir to be fed with the crumb which fell from 
the rich man s tabl moreov the dog came and lick hi sore 

16 22 and it came to pa that the beggar die and wa carri by 
the angel into abraham s bosom the rich man also die and wa 
buri 16 23 and in hell he lift up hi eye be in torment and 
seeth abraham afar off and lazaru in hi bosom 

16 24 and he cri and said father abraham have merci on me and 
send lazaru that he may dip the tip of hi finger in water and cool 
my tongu for i am torment in thi flame 

16 25 but abraham said son rememb that thou in thi lifetim 
receivedst thi good thing and likewi lazaru evil thing but now 
he is comfort and thou art torment 

16 26 and besid all thi between u and you there is a great gulf 
fix so that they which would pa from henc to you cannot neither 
can they pa to u that would come from thenc 

16 27 then he said i pray thee therefor father that thou wouldest 
send him to my father s hou 16 28 for i have five brother that he 
may testifi unto them lest they also come into thi place of torment 

16 29 abraham saith unto him they have mose and the prophet let 
them hear them 

16 30 and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from 
the dead they will repent 

16 31 and he said unto him if they hear not mose and the prophet 
neither will they be persuad though one rose from the dead 

17 1 then said he unto the discipl it is imposs but that 
offenc will come but woe unto him through whom they come 17 2 it 
were better for him that a millston were hang about hi neck and 
he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these littl 
one 

17 3 take heed to yourselv if thi brother trespass against thee 
rebuk him and if he repent forgiv him 

17 4 and if he trespass against thee seven time in a day and seven 
time in a day turn again to thee say i repent thou shalt 
forgiv him 

17 5 and the apostl said unto the lord increa our faith 

17 6 and the lord said if ye had faith a a grain of mustard seed ye 
might say unto thi sycamin tree be thou pluck up by the root and 
be thou plant in the sea and it should obey you 

17 7 but which of you have a servant plow or feed cattl 
will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and 
sit down to meat 17 8 and will not rather say unto him make readi 
wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serv me till i have eaten 
and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink 17 9 doth he 
thank that servant becau he did the thing that were command him 
i trow not 

17 10 so likewi ye when ye shall have done all those thing which 
are command you say we are unprofit servant we have done 
that which wa our duti to do 

17 11 and it came to pa a he went to jerusalem that he pa 
through the midst of samaria and galil 

17 12 and a he enter into a certain villag there met him ten men 
that were leper which stood afar off 17 13 and they lift up their 
voic and said jesu master have merci on u 

17 14 and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselv unto 
the priest and it came to pa that a they went they were 
clean 

17 15 and one of them when he saw that he wa heal turn back 
and with a loud voic glorifi god 17 16 and fell down on hi face 
at hi foot give him thank and he wa a samaritan 

17 17 and jesu answer said were there not ten clean but where 
are the nine 17 18 there are not found that return to give glori 
to god save thi stranger 

17 19 and he said unto him ari go thi way thi faith hath made 
thee whole 

17 20 and when he wa demand of the pharis when the kingdom of 
god should come he answer them and said the kingdom of god cometh 
not with observ 17 21 neither shall they say lo here or lo 
there for behold the kingdom of god is within you 

17 22 and he said unto the discipl the day will come when ye 
shall desir to see one of the day of the son of man and ye shall 
not see it 

17 23 and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after 
them nor follow them 

17 24 for a the lightn that lighteneth out of the one part under 
heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the 
son of man be in hi day 

17 25 but first must he suffer mani thing and be reject of thi 
gener 

17 26 and a it wa in the day of noe so shall it be also in the 
day of the son of man 

17 27 they did eat they drank they marri wife they were given in 
marriag until the day that noe enter into the ark and the flood 
came and destroy them all 

17 28 likewi also a it wa in the day of lot they did eat they 
drank they bought they sold they plant they build 17 29 but 
the same day that lot went out of sodom it rain fire and brimston 
from heaven and destroy them all 

17 30 even thu shall it be in the day when the son of man is 
reveal 

17 31 in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and hi stuff 
in the hou let him not come down to take it away and he that is in 
the field let him likewi not return back 

17 32 rememb lot s wife 

17 33 whosoev shall seek to save hi life shall lose it and 
whosoev shall lose hi life shall preserv it 

17 34 i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the 
one shall be taken and the other shall be left 

17 35 two woman shall be grind togeth the one shall be taken 
and the other left 

17 36 two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the 
other left 

17 37 and they answer and said unto him where lord and he said 
unto them wheresoev the bodi is thither will the eagl be 
gather togeth 

18 1 and he spake a parabl unto them to thi end that men ought 
alway to pray and not to faint 18 2 say there wa in a citi a 
judg which fear not god neither regard man 18 3 and there wa 
a widow in that citi and she came unto him say aveng me of mine 
adversari 

18 4 and he would not for a while but afterward he said within 
himself though i fear not god nor regard man 18 5 yet becau thi 
widow troubleth me i will aveng her lest by her continu come 
she weari me 

18 6 and the lord said hear what the unjust judg saith 

18 7 and shall not god aveng hi own elect which cri day and night 
unto him though he bear long with them 18 8 i tell you that he will 
aveng them speedili nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall 
he find faith on the earth 18 9 and he spake thi parabl unto 
certain which trust in themselv that they were righteou and 
despi other 18 10 two men went up into the templ to pray the 
one a pharis and the other a publican 

18 11 the pharis stood and pray thu with himself god i thank 
thee that i am not a other men are extort unjust 
adult or even a thi publican 

18 12 i fast twice in the week i give tith of all that i po 

18 13 and the publican stand afar off would not lift up so much 
a hi eye unto heaven but smote upon hi breast say god be 
merci to me a sinner 

18 14 i tell you thi man went down to hi hou justifi rather 
than the other for everi one that exalteth himself shall be aba 
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalt 

18 15 and they brought unto him also infant that he would touch 
them but when hi discipl saw it they rebuk them 

18 16 but jesu call them unto him and said suffer littl child 
to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of 
god 

18 17 verili i say unto you whosoev shall not receiv the kingdom 
of god a a littl child shall in no wise enter therein 

18 18 and a certain ruler ask him say good master what shall i 
do to inherit etern life 18 19 and jesu said unto him whi 
callest thou me good none is good save one that is god 

18 20 thou knowest the command do not commit adulteri do not 
kill do not steal do not bear fal wit honour thi father and 
thi mother 

18 21 and he said all these have i kept from my youth up 

18 22 now when jesu heard these thing he said unto him yet lackest 
thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribut unto the poor 
and thou shalt have treasur in heaven and come follow me 

18 23 and when he heard thi he wa veri sorrow for he wa veri 
rich 

18 24 and when jesu saw that he wa veri sorrow he said how 
hardli shall they that have rich enter into the kingdom of god 
18 25 for it is easier for a camel to go through a needl s eye than 
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 

18 26 and they that heard it said who then can be save 18 27 and 
he said the thing which are imposs with men are possibl with 
god 

18 28 then peter said lo we have left all and follow thee 

18 29 and he said unto them verili i say unto you there is no man 
that hath left hou or parent or brother or wife or child 
for the kingdom of god s sake 18 30 who shall not receiv manifold 
more in thi present time and in the world to come life everlast 

18 31 then he took unto him the twelv and said unto them behold we 
go up to jerusalem and all thing that are written by the prophet 
concern the son of man shall be accomplish 

18 32 for he shall be deliv unto the gentil and shall be 
mock and spite entreat and spit on 18 33 and they shall 
scourg him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise 
again 

18 34 and they understood none of these thing and thi say wa 
hid from them neither knew they the thing which were spoken 

18 35 and it came to pa that a he wa come nigh unto jericho a 
certain blind man sat by the way side beg 18 36 and hear the 
multitud pa by he ask what it meant 

18 37 and they told him that jesu of nazareth passeth by 

18 38 and he cri say jesu thou son of david have merci on 
me 

18 39 and they which went befor rebuk him that he should hold hi 
peac but he cri so much the more thou son of david have merci on 
me 

18 40 and jesu stood and command him to be brought unto him and 
when he wa come near he ask him 18 41 say what wilt thou that 
i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receiv my sight

thief 

19 47 and he taught daili in the templ but the chief priest and the 
scribe and the chief of the peopl sought to destroy him 19 48 and 
could not find what they might do for all the peopl were veri 
attent to hear him 

20 1 and it came to pa that on one of those day a he taught the 
peopl in the templ and preach the gospel the chief priest and 
the scribe came upon him with the elder 20 2 and spake unto him 
say tell u by what author doest thou these thing or who is 
he that gave thee thi author 20 3 and he answer and said unto 
them i will also ask you one thing and answer me 20 4 the baptism 
of john wa it from heaven or of men 20 5 and they reason with 
themselv say if we shall say from heaven he will say whi 
then believ ye him not 20 6 but and if we say of men all the 
peopl will stone u for they be persuad that john wa a prophet 

20 7 and they answer that they could not tell whenc it wa 

20 8 and jesu said unto them neither tell i you by what author i 
do these thing 

20 9 then began he to speak to the peopl thi parabl a certain man 
plant a vineyard and let it forth to husbandman and went into a 
far countri for a long time 

20 10 and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandman that they 
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandman beat 
him and sent him away empti 

20 11 and again he sent anoth servant and they beat him also and 
entreat him shame and sent him away empti 

20 12 and again he sent a third and they wound him also and cast 
him out 

20 13 then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send 
my belov son it may be they will rever him when they see him 

20 14 but when the husbandman saw him they reason among themselv 
say thi is the heir come let u kill him that the inherit 
may be our 

20 15 so they cast him out of the vineyard and kill him what 
therefor shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them 20 16 he shall 
come and destroy these husbandman and shall give the vineyard to 
other and when they heard it they said god forbid 

20 17 and he beheld them and said what is thi then that is written 
the stone which the builder reject the same is becom the head of 
the corner 20 18 whosoev shall fall upon that stone shall be 
broken but on whomsoev it shall fall it will grind him to powder 

20 19 and the chief priest and the scribe the same hour sought to 
lay hand on him and they fear the peopl for they perceiv that 
he had spoken thi parabl against them 

20 20 and they watch him and sent forth spi which should feign 
themselv just men that they might take hold of hi word that so 
they might deliv him unto the power and author of the governor 

20 21 and they ask him say master we know that thou sayest and 
teachest rightli neither acceptest thou the person of ani but 
teachest the way of god truli 20 22 is it law for u to give 
tribut unto caesar or no 20 23 but he perceiv their crafti 
and said unto them whi tempt ye me 20 24 shew me a penni whose 
imag and superscript hath it they answer and said caesar s 

20 25 and he said unto them render therefor unto caesar the thing 
which be caesar s and unto god the thing which be god s 

20 26 and they could not take hold of hi word befor the peopl and 
they marvel at hi answer and held their peac 

20 27 then came to him certain of the sadduc which deni that there 
is ani resurrect and they ask him 20 28 say master mose 
wrote unto u if ani man s brother die have a wife and he die 
without child that hi brother should take hi wife and rai up 
seed unto hi brother 

20 29 there were therefor seven brother and the first took a wife 
and die without child 

20 30 and the second took her to wife and he die childless 

20 31 and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and 
they left no child and die 

20 32 last of all the woman die also 

20 33 therefor in the resurrect whose wife of them is she for 
seven had her to wife 

20 34 and jesu answer said unto them the child of thi world 
marri and are given in marriag 20 35 but they which shall be 
account worthi to obtain that world and the resurrect from the 
dead neither marri nor are given in marriag 20 36 neither can they 
die ani more for they are equal unto the angel and are the child 
of god be the child of the resurrect 

20 37 now that the dead are rai even mose shew at the bush 
when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and 
the god of jacob 

20 38 for he is not a god of the dead but of the live for all live 
unto him 

20 39 then certain of the scribe answer said master thou hast 
well said 

20 40 and after that they durst not ask him ani question at all 

20 41 and he said unto them how say they that christ is david s son 
20 42 and david himself saith in the book of psalm the lord said 
unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 20 43 till i make thine 
enemi thi footstool 

20 44 david therefor calleth him lord how is he then hi son 20 45 
then in the audienc of all the peopl he said unto hi discipl 
20 46 bewar of the scribe which desir to walk in long robe and 
love greet in the market and the highest seat in the 
synagogu and the chief room at feast 20 47 which devour widow 
hou and for a shew make long prayer the same shall receiv 
greater damnat 

21 1 and he look up and saw the rich men cast their gift into 
the treasuri 

21 2 and he saw also a certain poor widow cast in thither two 
mite 

21 3 and he said of a truth i say unto you that thi poor widow hath 
cast in more than they all 21 4 for all these have of their abund 
cast in unto the offer of god but she of her penuri hath cast in 
all the live that she had 

21 5 and a some spake of the templ how it wa adorn with goodli 
stone and gift he said 21 6 a for these thing which ye behold 
the day will come in the which there shall not be left one stone 
upon anoth that shall not be thrown down 

21 7 and they ask him say master but when shall these thing 
be and what sign will there be when these thing shall come to pa 
21 8 and he said take heed that ye be not deceiv for mani shall

not therefor after them 

21 9 but when ye shall hear of war and commot be not terrifi 
for these thing must first come to pa but the end is not by and

21 10 then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and 
kingdom against kingdom 21 11 and great earthquak shall be in 
diver place and famin and pestil and fear sight and 
great sign shall there be from heaven 

21 12 but befor all these they shall lay their hand on you and

be brought befor king and ruler for my name s sake 

21 13 and it shall turn to you for a testimoni

ye shall answer 21 15 for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which 
all your adversari shall not be abl to gainsay nor resist 

21 16 and ye shall be betray both by parent and brother and 
kinsfolk and friend and some of you shall they cau to be put to 
death 

21 17 and ye shall be hate of all men for my name s sake 

21 18 but there shall not an hair of your head perish 

21 19 in your patienc po ye your soul 

21 20 and when ye shall see jerusalem compass with armi then know 
that the desol thereof is nigh 

21 21 then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountain and let 
them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that 
are in the countri enter thereinto 

21 22 for these be the day of vengeanc that all thing which are 
written may be fulfil 

21 23 but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give 
suck in those day for there shall be great distress in the land 
and wrath upon thi peopl 

21 24 and they shall fall by the edg of the sword and shall be led

power and great glori 

21 28 and when these thing begin to come to pa then look up and 
lift up your head for your redempt draweth nigh 

21 29 and he spake to them a parabl behold the fig tree and all the 
tree 21 30 when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own 
self that summer is now nigh at hand 

21 31 so likewi ye when ye see these thing come to pa know ye 
that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand 

21 32 verili i say unto you thi gener shall not pa away till

23 44 and it wa about the sixth hour and there wa a dark over 
all the earth until the ninth hour 

23 45 and the sun wa darken and the veil of the templ wa rent in 
the midst 

23 46 and when jesu had cri with a loud voic he said father

the ghost 

23 47 now when the centurion saw what wa done he glorifi god 
say certainli thi wa a righteou man 

23 48 and all the peopl that came togeth to that sight behold 
the thing which were done smote their breast and return

23 52 thi man went unto pilat and beg the bodi of jesu

sepulchr that wa hewn in stone wherein never man befor wa laid

24 2 and they found the stone roll away from the sepulchr 

24 3 and they enter in and found not the bodi of the lord jesu

24 7 say the son of man must be deliv into the hand of sin

24 8 and they rememb hi word 24 9 and return from the 
sepulchr and told all these thing unto the eleven and to all the

24 10 it wa mari magdalen and joanna and mari the mother of jame

24 22 yea and certain woman also of our compani made u astonish 
which were earli at the sepulchr 24 23 and when they found not hi

which said that he wa aliv 

24 24 and certain of them which were with u went to the sepulchr

the gospel accord to saint john 


1 1 in the begin wa the word and the word wa with god and the 
word wa god 

1 2 the same wa in the begin with god 

1 3 all thing were made by him and without him wa not ani thing 
made that wa made 

1 4 in him wa life and the life wa the light of men 

1 5 and the light shineth in dark and the dark comprehend 
it not 

1 6 there wa a man sent from god whose name wa john 

1 7 the same came for a wit to bear wit of the light that 
all men through him might believ 

1 8 he wa not that light but wa sent to bear wit of that light 

1 9 that wa the true light which lighteth everi man that cometh into 
the world 

1 10 he wa in the world and the world wa made by him and the world 
knew him not 

1 11 he came unto hi own and hi own receiv him not 

1 12 but a mani a receiv him to them gave he power to becom the 
son of god even to them that believ on hi name 1 13 which were 
born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of 
man but of god 

1 14 and the word wa made flesh and dwelt among u and we beheld 
hi glori the glori a of the onli begotten of the father full of 
grace and truth 

1 15 john bare wit of him and cri say thi wa he of whom 
i spake he that cometh after me is prefer befor me for he wa 
befor me 

1 16 and of hi ful have all we receiv and grace for grace 

1 17 for the law wa given by mose but grace and truth came by jesu 
christ 

1 18 no man hath seen god at ani time the onli begotten son which is 
in the bosom of the father he hath declar him 

1 19 and thi is the record of john when the jew sent priest and 
levit from jerusalem to ask him who art thou 1 20 and he 
confess and deni not but confess i am not the christ 

1 21 and they ask him what then art thou elia and he saith i am 
not art thou that prophet and he answer no 

1 22 then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer 
to them that sent u what sayest thou of thyself 1 23 he said i am 
the voic of one cri in the wilder make straight the way of 
the lord a said the prophet esaia 

1 24 and they which were sent were of the pharis 

1 25 and they ask him and said unto him whi baptizest thou then 
if thou be not that christ nor elia neither that prophet 1 26 
john answer them say i baptiz with water but there standeth 
one among you whom ye know not 1 27 he it is who come after me is 
prefer befor me whose shoe s latchet i am not worthi to unloo 

1 28 these thing were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john wa 
baptiz 

1 29 the next day john seeth jesu come unto him and saith behold 
the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world 

1 30 thi is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is 
prefer befor me for he wa befor me 

1 31 and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to 
israel therefor am i come baptiz with water 

1 32 and john bare record say i saw the spirit descend from 
heaven like a dove and it abod upon him 

1 33 and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptiz with water 
the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descend 
and remain on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holi 
ghost 

1 34 and i saw and bare record that thi is the son of god 

1 35 again the next day after john stood and two of hi discipl 
1 36 and look upon jesu a he walk he saith behold the lamb of 
god 1 37 and the two discipl heard him speak and they follow 
jesu 

1 38 then jesu turn and saw them follow and saith unto them 
what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say be 
interpret master where dwellest thou 1 39 he saith unto them 
come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abod with him 
that day for it wa about the tenth hour 

1 40 one of the two which heard john speak and follow him wa 
andrew simon peter s brother 

1 41 he first findeth hi own brother simon and saith unto him we 
have found the messia which is be interpret the christ 

1 42 and he brought him to jesu and when jesu beheld him he said 
thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be call cepha which is 
by interpret a stone 

1 43 the day follow jesu would go forth into galil and findeth 
philip and saith unto him follow me 

1 44 now philip wa of bethsaida the citi of andrew and peter 

1 45 philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him 
of whom mose in the law and the prophet did write jesu of 
nazareth the son of joseph 

1 46 and nathanael said unto him can there ani good thing come out of 
nazareth philip saith unto him come and see 

1 47 jesu saw nathanael come to him and saith of him behold an 
israelit ind in whom is no guil 1 48 nathanael saith unto him 
whenc knowest thou me jesu answer and said unto him befor that 
philip call thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee 

1 49 nathanael answer and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of 
god thou art the king of israel 

1 50 jesu answer and said unto him becau i said unto thee i saw 
thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater thing 
than these 

1 51 and he saith unto him verili verili i say unto you hereaft 
ye shall see heaven open and the angel of god ascend and 
descend upon the son of man 

2 1 and the third day there wa a marriag in cana of galil and the 
mother of jesu wa there 2 2 and both jesu wa call and hi 
discipl to the marriag 

2 3 and when they want wine the mother of jesu saith unto him 
they have no wine 

2 4 jesu saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine 
hour is not yet come 

2 5 hi mother saith unto the servant whatsoev he saith unto you 
do it 

2 6 and there were set there six waterpot of stone after the manner 
of the purifi of the jew contain two or three firkin apiec 

2 7 jesu saith unto them fill the waterpot with water and they 
fill them up to the brim 

2 8 and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor 
of the feast and they bare it 

2 9 when the ruler of the feast had tast the water that wa made 
wine and knew not whenc it wa but the servant which drew the 
water knew the governor of the feast call the bridegroom 2 10 and 
saith unto him everi man at the begin doth set forth good wine 
and when men have well drunk then that which is wor but thou hast 
kept the good wine until now 

2 11 thi begin of miracl did jesu in cana of galil and 
manifest forth hi glori and hi discipl believ on him 

2 12 after thi he went down to capernaum he and hi mother and hi 
brother and hi discipl and they continu there not mani day 

2 13 and the jew passov wa at hand and jesu went up to 
jerusalem 

2 14 and found in the templ those that sold ox and sheep and dove 
and the changer of money sit 2 15 and when he had made a scourg 
of small cord he drove them all out of the templ and the sheep 
and the ox and pour out the changer money and overthrew the 
tabl 2 16 and said unto them that sold dove take these thing 
henc make not my father s hou an hou of merchandi 

2 17 and hi discipl rememb that it wa written the zeal of 
thine hou hath eaten me up 

2 18 then answer the jew and said unto him what sign shewest thou 
unto u see that thou doest these thing 2 19 jesu answer and 
said unto them destroy thi templ and in three day i will rai it 
up 

2 20 then said the jew forti and six year wa thi templ in 
build and wilt thou rear it up in three day 2 21 but he spake 
of the templ of hi bodi 

2 22 when therefor he wa risen from the dead hi discipl 
rememb that he had said thi unto them and they believ the 
scriptur and the word which jesu had said 

2 23 now when he wa in jerusalem at the passov in the feast day 
mani believ in hi name when they saw the miracl which he did 

2 24 but jesu did not commit himself unto them becau he knew all 
men 2 25 and need not that ani should testifi of man for he knew 
what wa in man 

3 1 there wa a man of the pharis name nicodemu a ruler of the 
jew 3 2 the same came to jesu by night and said unto him rabbi 
we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these 
miracl that thou doest except god be with him 

3 3 jesu answer and said unto him verili verili i say unto thee 
except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god 

3 4 nicodemu saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old 
can he enter the second time into hi mother s womb and be born 3 5 
jesu answer verili verili i say unto thee except a man be born 
of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god 

3 6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born 
of the spirit is spirit 

3 7 marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again 

3 8 the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound 
thereof but canst not tell whenc it cometh and whither it goeth so 
is everi one that is born of the spirit 

3 9 nicodemu answer and said unto him how can these thing be 
3 10 jesu answer and said unto him art thou a master of israel 
and knowest not these thing 3 11 verili verili i say unto thee 
we speak that we do know and testifi that we have seen and ye 
receiv not our wit 

3 12 if i have told you earthli thing and ye believ not how shall 
ye believ if i tell you of heavenli thing 3 13 and no man hath 
ascend up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son 
of man which is in heaven 

3 14 and a mose lift up the serpent in the wilder even so 
must the son of man be lift up 3 15 that whosoev believeth in him 
should not perish but have etern life 

3 16 for god so love the world that he gave hi onli begotten son 
that whosoev believeth in him should not perish but have 
everlast life 

3 17 for god sent not hi son into the world to condemn the world but 
that the world through him might be save 

3 18 he that believeth on him is not condemn but he that believeth 
not is condemn alreadi becau he hath not believ in the name of 
the onli begotten son of god 

3 19 and thi is the condemn that light is come into the world 
and men love dark rather than light becau their deed were 
evil 

3 20 for everi one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to 
the light lest hi deed should be reprov 

3 21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that hi deed may 
be made manifest that they are wrought in god 

3 22 after these thing came jesu and hi discipl into the land of 
judaea and there he tarri with them and baptiz 

3 23 and john also wa baptiz in aenon near to salim becau there 
wa much water there and they came and were baptiz 

3 24 for john wa not yet cast into prison 

3 25 then there aro a question between some of john s discipl and 
the jew about purifi 

3 26 and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that wa 
with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest wit behold the same 
baptizeth and all men come to him 

3 27 john answer and said a man can receiv noth except it be 
given him from heaven 

3 28 ye yourselv bear me wit that i said i am not the christ 
but that i am sent befor him 

3 29 he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the 
bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatli becau 
of the bridegroom s voic thi my joy therefor is fulfil 

3 30 he must increa but i must decrea 

3 31 he that cometh from abov is abov all he that is of the earth 
is earthli and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is 
abov all 

3 32 and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man 
receiveth hi testimoni 

3 33 he that hath receiv hi testimoni hath set to hi seal that god 
is true 

3 34 for he whom god hath sent speaketh the word of god for god 
giveth not the spirit by measur unto him 

3 35 the father loveth the son and hath given all thing into hi 
hand 

3 36 he that believeth on the son hath everlast life and he that 
believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth 
on him 

4 1 when therefor the lord knew how the pharis had heard that 
jesu made and baptiz more discipl than john 4 2 though jesu 
himself baptiz not but hi discipl 4 3 he left judaea and 
depart again into galil 

4 4 and he must need go through samaria 

4 5 then cometh he to a citi of samaria which is call sychar near 
to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to hi son joseph 

4 6 now jacob s well wa there jesu therefor be weari with 
hi journey sat thu on the well and it wa about the sixth hour 

4 7 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesu saith unto 
her give me to drink 

4 8 for hi discipl were gone away unto the citi to buy meat 4 9 
then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou be a 
jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jew 
have no deal with the samaritan 

4 10 jesu answer and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of 
god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest 
have ask of him and he would have given thee live water 

4 11 the woman saith unto him sir thou hast noth to draw with 
and the well is deep from whenc then hast thou that live water 
4 12 art thou greater than our father jacob which gave u the well 
and drank thereof himself and hi child and hi cattl 4 13 
jesu answer and said unto her whosoev drinketh of thi water 
shall thirst again 4 14 but whosoev drinketh of the water that i 
shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him 
shall be in him a well of water spring up into everlast life 

4 15 the woman saith unto him sir give me thi water that i thirst 
not neither come hither to draw 

4 16 jesu saith unto her go call thi husband and come hither 

4 17 the woman answer and said i have no husband jesu said unto 
her thou hast well said i have no husband 4 18 for thou hast had 
five husband and he whom thou now hast is not thi husband in that 
saidst thou truli 

4 19 the woman saith unto him sir i perceiv that thou art a 
prophet 

4 20 our father worship in thi mountain and ye say that in 
jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship 

4 21 jesu saith unto her woman believ me the hour cometh when ye 
shall neither in thi mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the 
father 

4 22 ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for 
salvat is of the jew 

4 23 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipp shall 
worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such 
to worship him 

4 24 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in 
spirit and in truth 

4 25 the woman saith unto him i know that messia cometh which is 
call christ when he is come he will tell u all thing 

4 26 jesu saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he 

4 27 and upon thi came hi discipl and marvel that he talk 
with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or whi talkest 
thou with her 4 28 the woman then left her waterpot and went her 
way into the citi and saith to the men 4 29 come see a man which 
told me all thing that ever i did is not thi the christ 4 30 then 
they went out of the citi and came unto him 

4 31 in the mean while hi discipl pray him say master eat 

4 32 but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of 

4 33 therefor said the discipl one to anoth hath ani man brought 
him ought to eat 4 34 jesu saith unto them my meat is to do the 
will of him that sent me and to finish hi work 

4 35 say not ye there are yet four month and then cometh harvest 
behold i say unto you lift up your eye and look on the field for 
they are white alreadi to harvest 

4 36 and he that reapeth receiveth wage and gathereth fruit unto 
life etern that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoic 
togeth 

4 37 and herein is that say true one soweth and anoth reapeth 

4 38 i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestow no labour other men 
labour and ye are enter into their labour 

4 39 and mani of the samaritan of that citi believ on him for the 
say of the woman which testifi he told me all that ever i did 

4 40 so when the samaritan were come unto him they besought him that 
he would tarri with them and he abod there two day 

4 41 and mani more believ becau of hi own word 4 42 and said 
unto the woman now we believ not becau of thi say for we have 
heard him ourselv and know that thi is ind the christ the 
saviour of the world 

4 43 now after two day he depart thenc and went into galil 

4 44 for jesu himself testifi that a prophet hath no honour in hi 
own countri 

4 45 then when he wa come into galil the galilaean receiv him 
have seen all the thing that he did at jerusalem at the feast for 
they also went unto the feast 

4 46 so jesu came again into cana of galil where he made the water 
wine and there wa a certain nobleman whose son wa sick at 
capernaum 

4 47 when he heard that jesu wa come out of judaea into galil he 
went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal hi 
son for he wa at the point of death 

4 48 then said jesu unto him except ye see sign and wonder ye 
will not believ 

4 49 the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die 

4 50 jesu saith unto him go thi way thi son liveth and the man 
believ the word that jesu had spoken unto him and he went hi way 

4 51 and a he wa now go down hi servant met him and told him 
say thi son liveth 

4 52 then enquir he of them the hour when he began to amend and 
they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him 

4 53 so the father knew that it wa at the same hour in the which 
jesu said unto him thi son liveth and himself believ and hi 
whole hou 

4 54 thi is again the second miracl that jesu did when he wa come 
out of judaea into galil 

5 1 after thi there wa a feast of the jew and jesu went up to 
jerusalem 

5 2 now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is 
call in the hebrew tongu bethesda have five porch 

5 3 in these lay a great multitud of impot folk of blind halt 
wither wait for the move of the water 

5 4 for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and 
troubl the water whosoev then first after the troubl of the 
water step in wa made whole of whatsoev disea he had 

5 5 and a certain man wa there which had an infirm thirti and 
eight year 

5 6 when jesu saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time 
in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole 5 7 the 
impot man answer him sir i have no man when the water is 
troubl to put me into the pool but while i am come anoth 
steppeth down befor me 

5 8 jesu saith unto him rise take up thi bed and walk 

5 9 and immedi the man wa made whole and took up hi bed and 
walk and on the same day wa the sabbath 

5 10 the jew therefor said unto him that wa cure it is the 
sabbath day it is not law for thee to carri thi bed 

5 11 he answer them he that made me whole the same said unto me 
take up thi bed and walk 

5 12 then ask they him what man is that which said unto thee take 
up thi bed and walk 5 13 and he that wa heal wist not who it 
wa for jesu had convey himself away a multitud be in that 
place 

5 14 afterward jesu findeth him in the templ and said unto him 
behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a wor thing come unto 
thee 

5 15 the man depart and told the jew that it wa jesu which had 
made him whole 

5 16 and therefor did the jew persecut jesu and sought to slay 
him becau he had done these thing on the sabbath day 

5 17 but jesu answer them my father worketh hitherto and i work 

5 18 therefor the jew sought the more to kill him becau he not 
onli had broken the sabbath but said also that god wa hi father 
make himself equal with god 

5 19 then answer jesu and said unto them verili verili i say 
unto you the son can do noth of himself but what he seeth the 
father do for what thing soever he doeth these also doeth the son 
likewi 

5 20 for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all thing that 
himself doeth and he will shew him greater work than these that ye 
may marvel 

5 21 for a the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even 
so the son quickeneth whom he will 

5 22 for the father judgeth no man but hath commit all judgment 
unto the son 5 23 that all men should honour the son even a they 
honour the father 

he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent 
him 

5 24 verili verili i say unto you he that heareth my word and 
believeth on him that sent me hath everlast life and shall not 
come into condemn but is pa from death unto life 

5 25 verili verili i say unto you the hour is come and now is 
when the dead shall hear the voic of the son of god and they that 
hear shall live 

5 26 for a the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the 
son to have life in himself 5 27 and hath given him author to 
execut judgment also becau he is the son of man 

5 28 marvel not at thi for the hour is come in the which all that 
are in the graf shall hear hi voic 5 29 and shall come forth 
they that have done good unto the resurrect of life and they that 
have done evil unto the resurrect of damnat 

5 30 i can of mine own self do noth a i hear i judg and my 
judgment is just becau i seek not mine own will but the will of 
the father which hath sent me 

5 31 if i bear wit of myself my wit is not true 

5 32 there is anoth that beareth wit of me and i know that the 
wit which he witnesseth of me is true 

5 33 ye sent unto john and he bare wit unto the truth 

5 34 but i receiv not testimoni from man but these thing i say 
that ye might be save 

5 35 he wa a burn and a shine light and ye were will for a 
season to rejoic in hi light 

5 36 but i have greater wit than that of john for the work which 
the father hath given me to finish the same work that i do bear 
wit of me that the father hath sent me 

5 37 and the father himself which hath sent me hath born wit of 
me 

ye have neither heard hi voic at ani time nor seen hi shape 

5 38 and ye have not hi word abid in you for whom he hath sent 
him ye believ not 

5 39 search the scriptur for in them ye think ye have etern life 
and they are they which testifi of me 

5 40 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life 

5 41 i receiv not honour from men 

5 42 but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you 

5 43 i am come in my father s name and ye receiv me not if anoth 
shall come in hi own name him ye will receiv 

5 44 how can ye believ which receiv honour one of anoth and seek 
not the honour that cometh from god onli 5 45 do not think that i 
will accu you to the father there is one that accuseth you even 
mose in whom ye trust 

5 46 for had ye believ mose ye would have believ me for he 
wrote of me 

5 47 but if ye believ not hi write how shall ye believ my 
word 6 1 after these thing jesu went over the sea of galil 
which is the sea of tiberia 

6 2 and a great multitud follow him becau they saw hi miracl 
which he did on them that were disea 

6 3 and jesu went up into a mountain and there he sat with hi 
discipl 

6 4 and the passov a feast of the jew wa nigh 

6 5 when jesu then lift up hi eye and saw a great compani come 
unto him he saith unto philip whenc shall we buy bread that these 
may eat 6 6 and thi he said to prove him for he himself knew what 
he would do 

6 7 philip answer him two hundr pennyworth of bread is not 
suffici for them that everi one of them may take a littl 

6 8 one of hi discipl andrew simon peter s brother saith unto 
him 6 9 there is a lad here which hath five barley loaf and two 
small fish but what are they among so mani 6 10 and jesu said 
make the men sit down now there wa much grass in the place so the 
men sat down in number about five thousand 

6 11 and jesu took the loaf and when he had given thank he 
distribut to the discipl and the discipl to them that were set 
down and likewi of the fish a much a they would 

6 12 when they were fill he said unto hi discipl gather up the 
fragment that remain that noth be lost 

6 13 therefor they gather them togeth and fill twelv basket 
with the fragment of the five barley loaf which remain over and 
abov unto them that had eaten 

6 14 then those men when they had seen the miracl that jesu did 
said thi is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world 

6 15 when jesu therefor perceiv that they would come and take him 
by forc to make him a king he depart again into a mountain 
himself alon 

6 16 and when even wa now come hi discipl went down unto the sea 
6 17 and enter into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum 
and it wa now dark and jesu wa not come to them 

6 18 and the sea aro by reason of a great wind that blew 

6 19 so when they had row about five and twenti or thirti furlong 
they see jesu walk on the sea and draw nigh unto the ship and 
they were afraid 

6 20 but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid 

6 21 then they willingli receiv him into the ship and immedi 
the ship wa at the land whither they went 

6 22 the day follow when the peopl which stood on the other side 
of the sea saw that there wa none other boat there save that one 
whereinto hi discipl were enter and that jesu went not with hi 
discipl into the boat but that hi discipl were gone away alon 
6 23 howbeit there came other boat from tiberia nigh unto the place 
where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thank 6 24 
when the peopl therefor saw that jesu wa not there neither hi 
discipl they also took ship and came to capernaum seek for 
jesu 

6 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they 
said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither 6 26 jesu answer 
them and said verili verili i say unto you ye seek me not becau 
ye saw the miracl but becau ye did eat of the loaf and were 
fill 

6 27 labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which 
endureth unto everlast life which the son of man shall give unto 
you for him hath god the father seal 

6 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the 
work of god 6 29 jesu answer and said unto them thi is the 
work of god that ye believ on him whom he hath sent 

6 30 they said therefor unto him what sign shewest thou then that 
we may see and believ thee what dost thou work 6 31 our father 
did eat manna in the desert a it is written he gave them bread from 
heaven to eat 

6 32 then jesu said unto them verili verili i say unto you mose 
gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true 
bread from heaven 

6 33 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and 
giveth life unto the world 

6 34 then said they unto him lord evermor give u thi bread 

6 35 and jesu said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh 
to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never 
thirst 

6 36 but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believ not 

6 37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that 
cometh to me i will in no wise cast out 

6 38 for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the 
will of him that sent me 

6 39 and thi is the father s will which hath sent me that of all 
which he hath given me i should lose noth but should rai it up 
again at the last day 

6 40 and thi is the will of him that sent me that everi one which 
seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlast life and i 
will rai him up at the last day 

6 41 the jew then murmur at him becau he said i am the bread 
which came down from heaven 

6 42 and they said is not thi jesu the son of joseph whose father 
and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from 
heaven 6 43 jesu therefor answer and said unto them murmur not 
among yourselv 

6 44 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw 
him and i will rai him up at the last day 

6 45 it is written in the prophet and they shall be all taught of 
god 

everi man therefor that hath heard and hath learn of the father 
cometh unto me 

6 46 not that ani man hath seen the father save he which is of god 
he hath seen the father 

6 47 verili verili i say unto you he that believeth on me hath 
everlast life 

6 48 i am that bread of life 

6 49 your father did eat manna in the wilder and are dead 

6 50 thi is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may 
eat thereof and not die 

6 51 i am the live bread which came down from heaven if ani man eat 
of thi bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give 
is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world 

6 52 the jew therefor strove among themselv say how can thi 
man give u hi flesh to eat 6 53 then jesu said unto them verili 
verili i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and 
drink hi blood ye have no life in you 

6 54 whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath etern life 
and i will rai him up at the last day 

6 55 for my flesh is meat ind and my blood is drink ind 

6 56 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me 
and i in him 

6 57 a the live father hath sent me and i live by the father so 
he that eateth me even he shall live by me 

6 58 thi is that bread which came down from heaven not a your 
father did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of thi bread 
shall live for ever 

6 59 these thing said he in the synagogu a he taught in capernaum 

6 60 mani therefor of hi discipl when they had heard thi said 
thi is an hard say who can hear it 6 61 when jesu knew in 
himself that hi discipl murmur at it he said unto them doth 
thi offend you 6 62 what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend 
up where he wa befor 6 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the 
flesh profiteth noth the word that i speak unto you they are 
spirit and they are life 

6 64 but there are some of you that believ not for jesu knew from 
the begin who they were that believ not and who should betray 
him 

6 65 and he said therefor said i unto you that no man can come unto 
me except it were given unto him of my father 

6 66 from that time mani of hi discipl went back and walk no 
more with him 

6 67 then said jesu unto the twelv will ye also go away 6 68 then 
simon peter answer him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the 
word of etern life 

6 69 and we believ and are sure that thou art that christ the son of 
the live god 

6 70 jesu answer them have not i chosen you twelv and one of you 
is a devil 6 71 he spake of juda iscariot the son of simon for he 
it wa that should betray him be one of the twelv 

7 1 after these thing jesu walk in galil for he would not walk 
in jewri becau the jew sought to kill him 

7 2 now the jew s feast of tabernacl wa at hand 

7 3 hi brother therefor said unto him depart henc and go into 
judaea that thi discipl also may see the work that thou doest 

7 4 for there is no man that doeth ani thing in secret and he himself 
seeketh to be known openli if thou do these thing shew thyself to 
the world 

7 5 for neither did hi brother believ in him 

7 6 then jesu said unto them my time is not yet come but your time 
is alway readi 

7 7 the world cannot hate you but me it hateth becau i testifi of 
it that the work thereof are evil 

7 8 go ye up unto thi feast i go not up yet unto thi feast for my 
time is not yet full come 

7 9 when he had said these word unto them he abod still in galil 

7 10 but when hi brother were gone up then went he also up unto the 
feast not openli but a it were in secret 

7 11 then the jew sought him at the feast and said where is he 
7 12 and there wa much murmur among the peopl concern him for 
some said he is a good man other said nay but he deceiveth the 
peopl 

7 13 howbeit no man spake openli of him for fear of the jew 

7 14 now about the midst of the feast jesu went up into the templ 
and taught 

7 15 and the jew marvel say how knoweth thi man letter 
have never learn 7 16 jesu answer them and said my doctrin 
is not mine but hi that sent me 

7 17 if ani man will do hi will he shall know of the doctrin 
whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself 

7 18 he that speaketh of himself seeketh hi own glori but he that 
seeketh hi glori that sent him the same is true and no 
unright is in him 

7 19 did not mose give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the 
law whi go ye about to kill me 7 20 the peopl answer and said 
thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee 7 21 jesu answer 
and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel 

7 22 mose therefor gave unto you circumci not becau it is of 
mose but of the father and ye on the sabbath day circumci a 
man 

7 23 if a man on the sabbath day receiv circumci that the law of 
mose should not be broken are ye angri at me becau i have made a 
man everi whit whole on the sabbath day 7 24 judg not accord to 
the appear but judg righteou judgment 

7 25 then said some of them of jerusalem is not thi he whom they 
seek to kill 7 26 but lo he speaketh boldli and they say noth 
unto him do the ruler know ind that thi is the veri christ 
7 27 howbeit we know thi man whenc he is but when christ cometh no 
man knoweth whenc he is 

7 28 then cri jesu in the templ a he taught say ye both know 
me and ye know whenc i am and i am not come of myself but he that 
sent me is true whom ye know not 

7 29 but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me 

7 30 then they sought to take him but no man laid hand on him 
becau hi hour wa not yet come 

7 31 and mani of the peopl believ on him and said when christ 
cometh will he do more miracl than these which thi man hath done 
7 32 the pharis heard that the peopl murmur such thing 
concern him and the pharis and the chief priest sent offic 
to take him 

7 33 then said jesu unto them yet a littl while am i with you and 
then i go unto him that sent me 

7 34 ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither 
ye cannot come 

7 35 then said the jew among themselv whither will he go that we 
shall not find him will he go unto the disper among the gentil 
and teach the gentil 7 36 what manner of say is thi that he 
said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither 
ye cannot come 7 37 in the last day that great day of the feast 
jesu stood and cri say if ani man thirst let him come unto 
me and drink 

7 38 he that believeth on me a the scriptur hath said out of hi 
belli shall flow river of live water 

7 39 but thi spake he of the spirit which they that believ on him 
should receiv for the holi ghost wa not yet given becau that 
jesu wa not yet glorifi 7 40 mani of the peopl therefor when 
they heard thi say said of a truth thi is the prophet 

7 41 other said thi is the christ but some said shall christ come 
out of galil 7 42 hath not the scriptur said that christ cometh 
of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david 
wa 7 43 so there wa a divi among the peopl becau of him 

7 44 and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hand on 
him 

7 45 then came the offic to the chief priest and pharis and 
they said unto them whi have ye not brought him 7 46 the offic 
answer never man spake like thi man 

7 47 then answer them the pharis are ye also deceiv 7 48 
have ani of the ruler or of the pharis believ on him 7 49 but 
thi peopl who knoweth not the law are cur 

7 50 nicodemu saith unto them he that came to jesu by night be 
one of them 7 51 doth our law judg ani man befor it hear him and 
know what he doeth 7 52 they answer and said unto him art thou 
also of galil search and look for out of galil ariseth no 
prophet 

7 53 and everi man went unto hi own hou 

8 1 jesu went unto the mount of oliv 

8 2 and earli in the morn he came again into the templ and all 
the peopl came unto him and he sat down and taught them 

8 3 and the scribe and pharis brought unto him a woman taken in 
adulteri and when they had set her in the midst 8 4 they say unto 
him master thi woman wa taken in adulteri in the veri act 

8 5 now mose in the law command u that such should be stone but 
what sayest thou 8 6 thi they said tempt him that they might 
have to accu him but jesu stoop down and with hi finger wrote 
on the ground a though he heard them not 

8 7 so when they continu ask him he lift up himself and said 
unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a 
stone at her 

8 8 and again he stoop down and wrote on the ground 

8 9 and they which heard it be convict by their own conscienc 
went out one by one begin at the eldest even unto the last and 
jesu wa left alon and the woman stand in the midst 

8 10 when jesu had lift up himself and saw none but the woman he 
said unto her woman where are those thine accu hath no man 
condemn thee 8 11 she said no man lord and jesu said unto her 
neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more 

8 12 then spake jesu again unto them say i am the light of the 
world he that followeth me shall not walk in dark but shall have 
the light of life 

8 13 the pharis therefor said unto him thou bearest record of 
thyself thi record is not true 

8 14 jesu answer and said unto them though i bear record of 
myself yet my record is true for i know whenc i came and whither i 
go but ye cannot tell whenc i come and whither i go 

8 15 ye judg after the flesh i judg no man 

8 16 and yet if i judg my judgment is true for i am not alon but 
i and the father that sent me 

8 17 it is also written in your law that the testimoni of two men is 
true 

8 18 i am one that bear wit of myself and the father that sent me 
beareth wit of me 

8 19 then said they unto him where is thi father jesu answer ye 
neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have 
known my father also 

8 20 these word spake jesu in the treasuri a he taught in the 
templ and no man laid hand on him for hi hour wa not yet come 

8 21 then said jesu again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek 
me and shall die in your sin whither i go ye cannot come 

8 22 then said the jew will he kill himself becau he saith 
whither i go ye cannot come 

8 23 and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from abov ye 
are of thi world i am not of thi world 

8 24 i said therefor unto you that ye shall die in your sin for if 
ye believ not that i am he ye shall die in your sin 

8 25 then said they unto him who art thou and jesu saith unto them 
even the same that i said unto you from the begin 

8 26 i have mani thing to say and to judg of you but he that sent 
me is true and i speak to the world those thing which i have heard 
of him 

8 27 they understood not that he spake to them of the father 

8 28 then said jesu unto them when ye have lift up the son of man 
then shall ye know that i am he and that i do noth of myself but 
a my father hath taught me i speak these thing 

8 29 and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me 
alon for i do alway those thing that plea him 

8 30 a he spake these word mani believ on him 

8 31 then said jesu to those jew which believ on him if ye 
continu in my word then are ye my discipl ind 8 32 and ye 
shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free 

8 33 they answer him we be abraham s seed and were never in 
bondag to ani man how sayest thou ye shall be made free 8 34 
jesu answer them verili verili i say unto you whosoev 
committeth sin is the servant of sin 

8 35 and the servant abideth not in the hou for ever but the son 
abideth ever 

8 36 if the son therefor shall make you free ye shall be free 
ind 

8 37 i know that ye are abraham s seed but ye seek to kill me 
becau my word hath no place in you 

8 38 i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that 
which ye have seen with your father 

8 39 they answer and said unto him abraham is our father jesu 
saith unto them if ye were abraham s child ye would do the work 
of abraham 

8 40 but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth 
which i have heard of god thi did not abraham 

8 41 ye do the deed of your father then said they to him we be not 
born of fornic we have one father even god 

8 42 jesu said unto them if god were your father ye would love me 
for i proceed forth and came from god neither came i of myself but 
he sent me 

8 43 whi do ye not understand my speech even becau ye cannot hear 
my word 

8 44 ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye 
will do he wa a murder from the begin and abod not in the 
truth becau there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he 
speaketh of hi own for he is a liar and the father of it 

8 45 and becau i tell you the truth ye believ me not 

8 46 which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth whi do 
ye not believ me 8 47 he that is of god heareth god s word ye 
therefor hear them not becau ye are not of god 

8 48 then answer the jew and said unto him say we not well that 
thou art a samaritan and hast a devil 8 49 jesu answer i have 
not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me 

8 50 and i seek not mine own glori there is one that seeketh and 
judgeth 

8 51 verili verili i say unto you if a man keep my say he shall 
never see death 

8 52 then said the jew unto him now we know that thou hast a devil 

abraham is dead and the prophet and thou sayest if a man keep my 
say he shall never tast of death 

8 53 art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the 
prophet are dead whom makest thou thyself 8 54 jesu answer if 
i honour myself my honour is noth it is my father that honoureth 
me of whom ye say that he is your god 8 55 yet ye have not known 
him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a 
liar like unto you but i know him and keep hi say 

8 56 your father abraham rejoic to see my day and he saw it and 
wa glad 

8 57 then said the jew unto him thou art not yet fifti year old 
and hast thou seen abraham 8 58 jesu said unto them verili 
verili i say unto you befor abraham wa i am 

8 59 then took they up stone to cast at him but jesu hid himself 
and went out of the templ go through the midst of them and so 
pa by 

9 1 and a jesu pa by he saw a man which wa blind from hi 
birth 

9 2 and hi discipl ask him say master who did sin thi 
man or hi parent that he wa born blind 9 3 jesu answer 
neither hath thi man sin nor hi parent but that the work of 
god should be made manifest in him 

9 4 i must work the work of him that sent me while it is day the 
night cometh when no man can work 

9 5 a long a i am in the world i am the light of the world 

9 6 when he had thu spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of 
the spittl and he anoint the eye of the blind man with the clay 
9 7 and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by 
interpret sent he went hi way therefor and wash and came 
see 

9 8 the neighbour therefor and they which befor had seen him that 
he wa blind said is not thi he that sat and beg 9 9 some 
said thi is he other said he is like him but he said i am he 

9 10 therefor said they unto him how were thine eye open 9 11 
he answer and said a man that is call jesu made clay and 
anoint mine eye and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and 
wash and i went and wash and i receiv sight 

9 12 then said they unto him where is he he said i know not 

9 13 they brought to the pharis him that aforetim wa blind 

9 14 and it wa the sabbath day when jesu made the clay and open 
hi eye 

9 15 then again the pharis also ask him how he had receiv hi 
sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eye and i wash 
and do see 

9 16 therefor said some of the pharis thi man is not of god 
becau he keepeth not the sabbath day other said how can a man 
that is a sinner do such miracl and there wa a divi among 
them 

9 17 they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that 
he hath open thine eye he said he is a prophet 

9 18 but the jew did not believ concern him that he had been 
blind and receiv hi sight until they call the parent of him 
that had receiv hi sight 

9 19 and they ask them say is thi your son who ye say wa 
born blind how then doth he now see 9 20 hi parent answer them 
and said we know that thi is our son and that he wa born blind 
9 21 but by what mean he now seeth we know not or who hath open 
hi eye we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for 
himself 

9 22 these word spake hi parent becau they fear the jew for 
the jew had agr alreadi that if ani man did confess that he wa 
christ he should be put out of the synagogu 

9 23 therefor said hi parent he is of age ask him 

9 24 then again call they the man that wa blind and said unto him 
give god the prai we know that thi man is a sinner 

9 25 he answer and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not 
one thing i know that wherea i wa blind now i see 

9 26 then said they to him again what did he to thee how open he 
thine eye 9 27 he answer them i have told you alreadi and ye 
did not hear wherefor would ye hear it again will ye also be hi 
discipl 9 28 then they revil him and said thou art hi 
discipl but we are mose discipl 

9 29 we know that god spake unto mose a for thi fellow we know 
not from whenc he is 

9 30 the man answer and said unto them whi herein is a marvel 
thing that ye know not from whenc he is and yet he hath open mine 
eye 

9 31 now we know that god heareth not sinner but if ani man be a 
worshipp of god and doeth hi will him he heareth 

9 32 sinc the world began wa it not heard that ani man open the 
eye of one that wa born blind 

9 33 if thi man were not of god he could do noth 

9 34 they answer and said unto him thou wast altogeth born in 
sin and dost thou teach u and they cast him out 

9 35 jesu heard that they had cast him out and when he had found 
him he said unto him dost thou believ on the son of god 9 36 he 
answer and said who is he lord that i might believ on him 9 37 
and jesu said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that 
talketh with thee 

9 38 and he said lord i believ and he worship him 

9 39 and jesu said for judgment i am come into thi world that they 
which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind 

9 40 and some of the pharis which were with him heard these word 
and said unto him are we blind also 9 41 jesu said unto them if 
ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see 
therefor your sin remaineth 

10 1 verili verili i say unto you he that entereth not by the door 
into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a 
thief and a robber 

10 2 but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep 

10 3 to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear hi voic and he 
calleth hi own sheep by name and leadeth them out 

10 4 and when he putteth forth hi own sheep he goeth befor them 
and the sheep follow him for they know hi voic 

10 5 and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for 
they know not the voic of stranger 

10 6 thi parabl spake jesu unto them but they understood not what 
thing they were which he spake unto them 

10 7 then said jesu unto them again verili verili i say unto you 
i am the door of the sheep 

10 8 all that ever came befor me are thief and robber but the 
sheep did not hear them 

10 9 i am the door by me if ani man enter in he shall be save and 
shall go in and out and find pastur 

10 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to 
destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have 
it more abundantli 

10 11 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth hi life for 
the sheep 

10 12 but he that is an hirel and not the shepherd whose own the 
sheep are not seeth the wolf come and leaveth the sheep and 
fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep 

10 13 the hirel fleeth becau he is an hirel and careth not 
for the sheep 

10 14 i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine 

10 15 a the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay 
down my life for the sheep 

10 16 and other sheep i have which are not of thi fold them also i 
must bring and they shall hear my voic and there shall be one fold 
and one shepherd 

10 17 therefor doth my father love me becau i lay down my life 
that i might take it again 

10 18 no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have 
power to lay it down and i have power to take it again thi 
command have i receiv of my father 

10 19 there wa a divi therefor again among the jew for these 
say 

10 20 and mani of them said he hath a devil and is mad whi hear ye 
him 10 21 other said these are not the word of him that hath a 
devil can a devil open the eye of the blind 10 22 and it wa at 
jerusalem the feast of the dedic and it wa winter 

10 23 and jesu walk in the templ in solomon s porch 

10 24 then came the jew round about him and said unto him how long 
dost thou make u to doubt if thou be the christ tell u plainli 

10 25 jesu answer them i told you and ye believ not the work 
that i do in my father s name they bear wit of me 

10 26 but ye believ not becau ye are not of my sheep a i said 
unto you 

10 27 my sheep hear my voic and i know them and they follow me 
10 28 and i give unto them etern life and they shall never perish 
neither shall ani man pluck them out of my hand 

10 29 my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man 
is abl to pluck them out of my father s hand 

10 30 i and my father are one 

10 31 then the jew took up stone again to stone him 

10 32 jesu answer them mani good work have i shew you from my 
father for which of those work do ye stone me 10 33 the jew 
answer him say for a good work we stone thee not but for 
blasphemi and becau that thou be a man makest thyself god 

10 34 jesu answer them is it not written in your law i said ye 
are god 10 35 if he call them god unto whom the word of god 
came and the scriptur cannot be broken 10 36 say ye of him whom 
the father hath sanctifi and sent into the world thou blasphemest 
becau i said i am the son of god 10 37 if i do not the work of 
my father believ me not 

10 38 but if i do though ye believ not me believ the work that 
ye may know and believ that the father is in me and i in him 

10 39 therefor they sought again to take him but he escap out of 
their hand 10 40 and went away again beyond jordan into the place 
where john at first baptiz and there he abod 

10 41 and mani resort unto him and said john did no miracl but 
all thing that john spake of thi man were true 

10 42 and mani believ on him there 

11 1 now a certain man wa sick name lazaru of bethani the town 
of mari and her sister martha 

11 2 it wa that mari which anoint the lord with ointment and 
wipe hi foot with her hair whose brother lazaru wa sick 11 3 
therefor hi sister sent unto him say lord behold he whom 
thou lovest is sick 

11 4 when jesu heard that he said thi sick is not unto death 
but for the glori of god that the son of god might be glorifi 
therebi 

11 5 now jesu love martha and her sister and lazaru 

11 6 when he had heard therefor that he wa sick he abod two day 
still in the same place where he wa 

11 7 then after that saith he to hi discipl let u go into judaea 
again 

11 8 hi discipl say unto him master the jew of late sought to 
stone thee and goest thou thither again 11 9 jesu answer are 
there not twelv hour in the day if ani man walk in the day he 
stumbleth not becau he seeth the light of thi world 

11 10 but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth becau there is 
no light in him 

11 11 these thing said he and after that he saith unto them our 
friend lazaru sleepeth but i go that i may awak him out of sleep 

11 12 then said hi discipl lord if he sleep he shall do well 

11 13 howbeit jesu spake of hi death but they thought that he had 
spoken of take of rest in sleep 

11 14 then said jesu unto them plainli lazaru is dead 

11 15 and i am glad for your sake that i wa not there to the intent 
ye may believ nevertheless let u go unto him 

11 16 then said thoma which is call didymu unto hi 
fellowdiscipl let u also go that we may die with him 

11 17 then when jesu came he found that he had lain in the grave 
four day alreadi 

11 18 now bethani wa nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlong off 
11 19 and mani of the jew came to martha and mari to comfort them 
concern their brother 

11 20 then martha a soon a she heard that jesu wa come went 
and met him but mari sat still in the hou 

11 21 then said martha unto jesu lord if thou hadst been here my 
brother had not die 

11 22 but i know that even now whatsoev thou wilt ask of god god 
will give it thee 

11 23 jesu saith unto her thi brother shall rise again 

11 24 martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the 
resurrect at the last day 

11 25 jesu said unto her i am the resurrect and the life he 
that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live 11 26 
and whosoev liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest 
thou thi 11 27 she saith unto him yea lord i believ that thou 
art the christ the son of god which should come into the world 

11 28 and when she had so said she went her way and call mari her 
sister secretli say the master is come and calleth for thee 

11 29 a soon a she heard that she aro quickli and came unto him 

11 30 now jesu wa not yet come into the town but wa in that place 
where martha met him 

11 31 the jew then which were with her in the hou and comfort 
her when they saw mari that she rose up hastili and went out 
follow her say she goeth unto the grave to weep there 

11 32 then when mari wa come where jesu wa and saw him she fell 
down at hi foot say unto him lord if thou hadst been here my 
brother had not die 

11 33 when jesu therefor saw her weep and the jew also weep 
which came with her he groan in the spirit and wa troubl 

11 34 and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come 
and see 

11 35 jesu wept 

11 36 then said the jew behold how he love him 11 37 and some of 
them said could not thi man which open the eye of the blind 
have cau that even thi man should not have die 11 38 jesu 
therefor again groan in himself cometh to the grave it wa a 
cave and a stone lay upon it 

11 39 jesu said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him 
that wa dead saith unto him lord by thi time he stinketh for he 
hath been dead four day 

11 40 jesu saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou 
wouldest believ thou shouldest see the glori of god 11 41 then 
they took away the stone from the place where the dead wa laid and 
jesu lift up hi eye and said father i thank thee that thou 
hast heard me 

11 42 and i knew that thou hearest me alway but becau of the 
peopl which stand by i said it that they may believ that thou hast 
sent me 

11 43 and when he thu had spoken he cri with a loud voic 
lazaru come forth 

11 44 and he that wa dead came forth bound hand and foot with 
gravecloth and hi face wa bound about with a napkin jesu saith 
unto them loo him and let him go 

11 45 then mani of the jew which came to mari and had seen the 
thing which jesu did believ on him 

11 46 but some of them went their way to the pharis and told them 
what thing jesu had done 

11 47 then gather the chief priest and the pharis a council and 
said what do we for thi man doeth mani miracl 

11 48 if we let him thu alon all men will believ on him and the 
roman shall come and take away both our place and nation 

11 49 and one of them name caiapha be the high priest that same 
year said unto them ye know noth at all 11 50 nor consid that 
it is expedi for u that one man should die for the peopl and 
that the whole nation perish not 

11 51 and thi spake he not of himself but be high priest that 
year he prophesi that jesu should die for that nation 11 52 and 
not for that nation onli but that also he should gather togeth in 
one the child of god that were scatter abroad 

11 53 then from that day forth they took counsel togeth for to put 
him to death 

11 54 jesu therefor walk no more openli among the jew but went 
thenc unto a countri near to the wilder into a citi call 
ephraim and there continu with hi discipl 

11 55 and the jew passov wa nigh at hand and mani went out of 
the countri up to jerusalem befor the passov to purifi themselv 

11 56 then sought they for jesu and spake among themselv a they 
stood in the templ what think ye that he will not come to the 
feast 11 57 now both the chief priest and the pharis had given a 
command that if ani man knew where he were he should shew it 
that they might take him 

12 1 then jesu six day befor the passov came to bethani where 
lazaru wa which had been dead whom he rai from the dead 

12 2 there they made him a supper and martha serv but lazaru wa 
one of them that sat at the tabl with him 

12 3 then took mari a pound of ointment of spikenard veri costli and 
anoint the foot of jesu and wipe hi foot with her hair and the 
hou wa fill with the odour of the ointment 

12 4 then saith one of hi discipl juda iscariot simon s son 
which should betray him 12 5 whi wa not thi ointment sold for three 
hundr penni and given to the poor 12 6 thi he said not that he 
care for the poor but becau he wa a thief and had the bag and 
bare what wa put therein 

12 7 then said jesu let her alon against the day of my buri 
hath she kept thi 

12 8 for the poor alway ye have with you but me ye have not alway 

12 9 much peopl of the jew therefor knew that he wa there and 
they came not for jesu sake onli but that they might see lazaru 
also whom he had rai from the dead 

12 10 but the chief priest consult that they might put lazaru also 
to death 12 11 becau that by reason of him mani of the jew went 
away and believ on jesu 

12 12 on the next day much peopl that were come to the feast when 
they heard that jesu wa come to jerusalem 12 13 took branch of 
palm tree and went forth to meet him and cri hosanna bless is 
the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord 

12 14 and jesu when he had found a young a sat thereon a it is 
written 12 15 fear not daughter of sion behold thi king cometh 
sit on an a s colt 

12 16 these thing understood not hi discipl at the first but when 
jesu wa glorifi then rememb they that these thing were 
written of him and that they had done these thing unto him 

12 17 the peopl therefor that wa with him when he call lazaru 
out of hi grave and rai him from the dead bare record 

12 18 for thi cau the peopl also met him for that they heard that 
he had done thi miracl 

12 19 the pharis therefor said among themselv perceiv ye how 
ye prevail noth behold the world is gone after him 

12 20 and there were certain greek among them that came up to worship 
at the feast 12 21 the same came therefor to philip which wa of 
bethsaida of galil and desir him say sir we would see 
jesu 

12 22 philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip 
tell jesu 

12 23 and jesu answer them say the hour is come that the son 
of man should be glorifi 

12 24 verili verili i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into 
the ground and die it abideth alon but if it die it bringeth forth 
much fruit 

12 25 he that loveth hi life shall lose it and he that hateth hi 
life in thi world shall keep it unto life etern 

12 26 if ani man serv me let him follow me and where i am there 
shall also my servant be if ani man serv me him will my father 
honour 

12 27 now is my soul troubl and what shall i say father save me 
from thi hour but for thi cau came i unto thi hour 

12 28 father glorifi thi name then came there a voic from heaven 
say i have both glorifi it and will glorifi it again 

12 29 the peopl therefor that stood by and heard it said that it 
thunder other said an angel spake to him 

12 30 jesu answer and said thi voic came not becau of me but 
for your sake 

12 31 now is the judgment of thi world now shall the princ of thi 
world be cast out 

12 32 and i if i be lift up from the earth will draw all men unto 
me 

12 33 thi he said signifi what death he should die 

12 34 the peopl answer him we have heard out of the law that 
christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be 
lift up who is thi son of man 12 35 then jesu said unto them 
yet a littl while is the light with you 

walk while ye have the light lest dark come upon you for he that 
walketh in dark knoweth not whither he goeth 

12 36 while ye have light believ in the light that ye may be the 
child of light these thing spake jesu and depart and did 
hide himself from them 

12 37 but though he had done so mani miracl befor them yet they 
believ not on him 12 38 that the say of esaia the prophet might 
be fulfil which he spake lord who hath believ our report and 
to whom hath the arm of the lord been reveal 12 39 therefor they 
could not believ becau that esaia said again 12 40 he hath 
blind their eye and harden their heart that they should not see 
with their eye nor understand with their heart and be convert 
and i should heal them 

12 41 these thing said esaia when he saw hi glori and spake of 
him 

12 42 nevertheless among the chief ruler also mani believ on him 
but becau of the pharis they did not confess him lest they 
should be put out of the synagogu 12 43 for they love the prai of 
men more than the prai of god 

12 44 jesu cri and said he that believeth on me believeth not on 
me but on him that sent me 

12 45 and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me 

12 46 i am come a light into the world that whosoev believeth on me 
should not abid in dark 

12 47 and if ani man hear my word and believ not i judg him not 
for i came not to judg the world but to save the world 

12 48 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my word hath one that 
judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judg him in 
the last day 

12 49 for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me 
he gave me a command what i should say and what i should speak 

12 50 and i know that hi command is life everlast whatsoev 
i speak therefor even a the father said unto me so i speak 

13 1 now befor the feast of the passov when jesu knew that hi 
hour wa come that he should depart out of thi world unto the father 
have love hi own which were in the world he love them unto the 
end 

13 2 and supper be end the devil have now put into the heart 
of juda iscariot simon s son to betray him 13 3 jesu know that 
the father had given all thing into hi hand and that he wa come 
from god and went to god 13 4 he riseth from supper and laid asid 
hi garment and took a towel and gird himself 

13 5 after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the 
discipl foot and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he wa 
gird 

13 6 then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord 
dost thou wash my foot 13 7 jesu answer and said unto him what i 
do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereaft 

13 8 peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my foot jesu 
answer him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me 

13 9 simon peter saith unto him lord not my foot onli but also my 
hand and my head 

13 10 jesu saith to him he that is wash needeth not save to wash 
hi foot but is clean everi whit and ye are clean but not all 

13 11 for he knew who should betray him therefor said he ye are not 
all clean 

13 12 so after he had wash their foot and had taken hi garment 
and wa set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to 
you 13 13 ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am 

13 14 if i then your lord and master have wash your foot ye also 
ought to wash one anoth s foot 

13 15 for i have given you an exampl that ye should do a i have 
done to you 

13 16 verili verili i say unto you the servant is not greater than 
hi lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him 

13 17 if ye know these thing happi are ye if ye do them 

13 18 i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the 
scriptur may be fulfil he that eateth bread with me hath lift 
up hi heel against me 

13 19 now i tell you befor it come that when it is come to pa ye 
may believ that i am he 

13 20 verili verili i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoev i 
send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent 
me 

13 21 when jesu had thu said he wa troubl in spirit and 
testifi and said verili verili i say unto you that one of you 
shall betray me 

13 22 then the discipl look one on anoth doubt of whom he 
spake 

13 23 now there wa lean on jesu bosom one of hi discipl whom 
jesu love 

13 24 simon peter therefor beckon to him that he should ask who it 
should be of whom he spake 

13 25 he then lie on jesu breast saith unto him lord who is it 
13 26 jesu answer he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i 
have dip it and when he had dip the sop he gave it to juda 
iscariot the son of simon 

13 27 and after the sop satan enter into him then said jesu unto 
him that thou doest do quickli 

13 28 now no man at the tabl knew for what intent he spake thi unto 
him 

13 29 for some of them thought becau juda had the bag that jesu 
had said unto him buy those thing that we have need of against the 
feast or that he should give someth to the poor 

13 30 he then have receiv the sop went immedi out and it wa 
night 

13 31 therefor when he wa gone out jesu said now is the son of 
man glorifi and god is glorifi in him 

13 32 if god be glorifi in him god shall also glorifi him in 
himself and shall straightway glorifi him 

13 33 littl child yet a littl while i am with you ye shall seek 
me and a i said unto the jew whither i go ye cannot come so now 
i say to you 

13 34 a new command i give unto you that ye love one anoth a 
i have love you that ye also love one anoth 

13 35 by thi shall all men know that ye are my discipl if ye have 
love one to anoth 

13 36 simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesu 
answer him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou 
shalt follow me afterward 

13 37 peter said unto him lord whi cannot i follow thee now i will 
lay down my life for thi sake 

13 38 jesu answer him wilt thou lay down thi life for my sake 
verili verili i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou 
hast deni me thrice 

14 1 let not your heart be troubl ye believ in god believ also

14 4 and whither i go ye know and the way ye know 

14 5 thoma saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and 
how can we know the way 14 6 jesu saith unto him i am the way the 
truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me 

14 7 if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from 
henceforth ye know him and have seen him 

14 8 philip saith unto him lord shew u the father and it sufficeth

14 9 jesu saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet 
hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the 
father and how sayest thou then shew u the father 14 10 believest 
thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the word

will love him and will manifest myself to him 

14 22 juda saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou 
wilt manifest thyself unto u and not unto the world 14 23 jesu 
answer and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my word 
and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our 
abod with him 

14 24 he that loveth me not keepeth not my say and the word which

21 15 so when they had dine jesu saith to simon peter simon son 
of jona lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea

21 16 he saith to him again the second time simon son of jona

girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou

gird thee and carri thee whither thou wouldest not 

21 19 thi spake he signifi by what death he should glorifi god

die but if i will that he tarri till i come what is that to thee 
21 24 thi is the discipl which testifieth of these thing and wrote

21 25 and there are also mani other thing which jesu did the which 
if they should be written everi one i suppo that even the world 
itself could not contain the book that should be written amen 




the act of the apostl 


1 1 the former treati have i made o theophilu of all that jesu 
began both to do and teach 1 2 until the day in which he wa taken

1 8 but ye shall receiv power after that the holi ghost is come upon

1 10 and while they look stedfastli toward heaven a he went up 
behold two men stood by them in white apparel 1 11 which also said

of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen 1 25 that he 
may take part of thi ministri and apostleship from which juda by 
transgress fell that he might go to hi own place 

1 26 and they gave forth their lot and the lot fell upon matthia 
and he wa number with the eleven apostl 

2 1 and when the day of pentecost wa fulli come they were all with 
one accord in one place 

2 2 and suddenli there came a sound from heaven a of a rush mighti

make thi foe thi footstool 

2 36 therefor let all the hou of israel know assuredli that god 
hath made the same jesu whom ye have crucifi both lord and

2 37 now when they heard thi they were prick in their heart and 
said unto peter and to the rest of the apostl men and brother 
what shall we do 2 38 then peter said unto them repent and be 
baptiz everi one of you in the name of jesu christ for the 
remiss of sin and ye shall receiv the gift of the holi ghost 

2 39 for the promi is unto you and to your child and to all

2 42 and they continu stedfastli in the apostl doctrin and 
fellowship and in break of bread and in prayer 

2 43 and fear came upon everi soul and mani wonder and sign were

2 44 and all that believ were togeth and had all thing common 
2 45 and sold their poss and good and part them to all men 
a everi man had need 

2 46 and they continu daili with one accord in the templ and 
break bread from hou to hou did eat their meat with glad

3 1 now peter and john went up togeth into the templ at the hour of 
prayer be the ninth hour 

3 2 and a certain man lame from hi mother s womb wa carri whom 
they laid daili at the gate of the templ which is call beauti 
to ask alm of them that enter into the templ 3 3 who see peter 
and john about to go into the templ ask an alm 

3 4 and peter fasten hi eye upon him with john said look on

3 11 and a the lame man which wa heal held peter and john all the 
peopl ran togeth unto them in the porch that is call solomon s 
greatli wonder 

3 12 and when peter saw it he answer unto the peopl ye men of

though by our own power or holi we had made thi man to walk 
3 13 the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our

3 16 and hi name through faith in hi name hath made thi man strong 
whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him 
thi perfect sound in the presenc of you all 

3 17 and now brother i wot that through ignor ye did it a did

3 18 but those thing which god befor had shew by the mouth of all 
hi prophet that christ should suffer he hath so fulfil 

3 19 repent ye therefor and be convert that your sin may be 
blot out when the time of refresh shall come from the presenc

3 20 and he shall send jesu christ which befor wa preach unto 
you 3 21 whom the heaven must receiv until the time of restitut 
of all thing which god hath spoken by the mouth of all hi holi 
prophet sinc the world began 

3 22 for mose truli said unto the father a prophet shall the lord 
your god rai up unto you of your brother like unto me him shall 
ye hear in all thing whatsoev he shall say unto you 

3 23 and it shall come to pa that everi soul which will not hear

3 25 ye are the child of the prophet and of the coven which 
god made with our father say unto abraham and in thi seed shall 
all the kindr of the earth be bless 

3 26 unto you first god have rai up hi son jesu sent him to 
bless you in turn away everi one of you from hi iniqu 

4 1 and a they spake unto the peopl the priest and the captain of 
the templ and the sadduc came upon them 4 2 be griev that 
they taught the peopl and preach through jesu the resurrect 
from the dead 

4 3 and they laid hand on them and put them in hold unto the next 
day for it wa now eventid 

4 4 howbeit mani of them which heard the word believ and the number 
of the men wa about five thousand 

4 5 and it came to pa on the morrow that their ruler and elder 
and scribe 4 6 and anna the high priest and caiapha and john 
and alexand and a mani a were of the kindr of the high priest 
were gather togeth at jerusalem 

4 7 and when they had set them in the midst they ask by what 
power or by what name have ye done thi 4 8 then peter fill 
with the holi ghost said unto them ye ruler of the peopl and 
elder of israel 4 9 if we thi day be examin of the good deed done 
to the impot man by what mean he is made whole 4 10 be it known 
unto you all and to all the peopl of israel that by the name of 
jesu christ of nazareth whom ye crucifi whom god rai from the 
dead even by him doth thi man stand here befor you whole 

4 11 thi is the stone which wa set at nought of you builder which 
is becom the head of the corner 

4 12 neither is there salvat in ani other for there is none other 
name under heaven given among men wherebi we must be save 

4 13 now when they saw the bold of peter and john and perceiv 
that they were unlearn and ignor men they marvel and they 
took knowledg of them that they had been with jesu 

4 14 and behold the man which wa heal stand with them they 
could say noth against it 

4 15 but when they had command them to go asid out of the council 
they confer among themselv 4 16 say what shall we do to 
these men for that ind a notabl miracl hath been done by them is 
manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deni it 

4 17 but that it spread no further among the peopl let u straitli 
threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in thi name 

4 18 and they call them and command them not to speak at all nor 
teach in the name of jesu 

4 19 but peter and john answer and said unto them whether it be 
right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god 
judg ye 

4 20 for we cannot but speak the thing which we have seen and heard 

4 21 so when they had further threaten them they let them go 
find noth how they might punish them becau of the peopl for 
all men glorifi god for that which wa done 

4 22 for the man wa abov forti year old on whom thi miracl of 
heal wa shew 

4 23 and be let go they went to their own compani and report 
all that the chief priest and elder had said unto them 

4 24 and when they heard that they lift up their voic to god with 
one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and 
earth and the sea and all that in them is 4 25 who by the mouth of 
thi servant david hast said whi did the heathen rage and the peopl 
imagin vain thing 4 26 the king of the earth stood up and the 
ruler were gather togeth against the lord and against hi 
christ 

4 27 for of a truth against thi holi child jesu whom thou hast 
anoint both herod and pontiu pilat with the gentil and the 
peopl of israel were gather togeth 4 28 for to do whatsoev 
thi hand and thi counsel determin befor to be done 

4 29 and now lord behold their threaten and grant unto thi 
servant that with all bold they may speak thi word 4 30 by 
stretch forth thine hand to heal and that sign and wonder may be 
done by the name of thi holi child jesu 

4 31 and when they had pray the place wa shaken where they were 
assembl togeth and they were all fill with the holi ghost and 
they spake the word of god with bold 

4 32 and the multitud of them that believ were of one heart and of 
one soul neither said ani of them that ought of the thing which he 
poss wa hi own but they had all thing common 

4 33 and with great power gave the apostl wit of the 
resurrect of the lord jesu and great grace wa upon them all 

4 34 neither wa there ani among them that lack for a mani a were 
possessor of land or hou sold them and brought the price of the 
thing that were sold 4 35 and laid them down at the apostl foot 
and distribut wa made unto everi man accord a he had need 

4 36 and jose who by the apostl wa surnam barnaba which is 
be interpret the son of consol a levit and of the 
countri of cypru 4 37 have land sold it and brought the money 
and laid it at the apostl foot 

5 1 but a certain man name anania with sapphira hi wife sold a 
poss 5 2 and kept back part of the price hi wife also be 
privi to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostl 
foot 

5 3 but peter said anania whi hath satan fill thine heart to lie 
to the holi ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land 
5 4 while it remain wa it not thine own and after it wa sold 
wa it not in thine own power whi hast thou conceiv thi thing in 
thine heart thou hast not lie unto men but unto god 

5 5 and anania hear these word fell down and gave up the ghost 
and great fear came on all them that heard these thing 

5 6 and the young men aro wound him up and carri him out and 
buri him 

5 7 and it wa about the space of three hour after when hi wife 
not know what wa done came in 

5 8 and peter answer unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for 
so much and she said yea for so much 

5 9 then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agr togeth 
to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the foot of them which have 
buri thi husband are at the door and shall carri thee out 

5 10 then fell she down straightway at hi foot and yield up the 
ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carri 
her forth buri her by her husband 

5 11 and great fear came upon all the church and upon a mani a 
heard these thing 

5 12 and by the hand of the apostl were mani sign and wonder 
wrought among the peopl and they were all with one accord in 
solomon s porch 

5 13 and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the peopl 
magnifi them 

5 14 and believ were the more ad to the lord multitud both of 
men and woman 5 15 insomuch that they brought forth the sick into 
the street and laid them on bed and couch that at the least the 
shadow of peter pa by might overshadow some of them 

5 16 there came also a multitud out of the citi round about unto 
jerusalem bring sick folk and them which were vex with unclean 
spirit and they were heal everi one 

5 17 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him 
which is the sect of the sadduc and were fill with 
indign 5 18 and laid their hand on the apostl and put them 
in the common prison 

5 19 but the angel of the lord by night open the prison door and 
brought them forth and said 5 20 go stand and speak in the templ 
to the peopl all the word of thi life 

5 21 and when they heard that they enter into the templ earli in 
the morn and taught but the high priest came and they that were 
with him and call the council togeth and all the senat of the 
child of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought 

5 22 but when the offic came and found them not in the prison 
they return and told 5 23 say the prison truli found we shut 
with all safeti and the keeper stand without befor the door 
but when we had open we found no man within 

5 24 now when the high priest and the captain of the templ and the 
chief priest heard these thing they doubt of them whereunto thi 
would grow 

5 25 then came one and told them say behold the men whom ye put 
in prison are stand in the templ and teach the peopl 

5 26 then went the captain with the offic and brought them without 
violenc for they fear the peopl lest they should have been 
stone 

5 27 and when they had brought them they set them befor the council 
and the high priest ask them 5 28 say did not we straitli 
command you that ye should not teach in thi name and behold ye 
have fill jerusalem with your doctrin and intend to bring thi 
man s blood upon u 

5 29 then peter and the other apostl answer and said we ought to 
obey god rather than men 

5 30 the god of our father rai up jesu whom ye slew and hang 
on a tree 

5 31 him hath god exalt with hi right hand to be a princ and a 
saviour for to give repent to israel and forgiv of sin 

5 32 and we are hi wit of these thing and so is also the holi 
ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him 

5 33 when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took 
counsel to slay them 

5 34 then stood there up one in the council a pharis name 
gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reput among all the peopl 
and command to put the apostl forth a littl space 5 35 and said 
unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselv what ye intend to 
do a touch these men 

5 36 for befor these day rose up theuda boast himself to be 
somebodi to whom a number of men about four hundr join 
themselv who wa slain and all a mani a obey him were 
scatter and brought to nought 

5 37 after thi man rose up juda of galil in the day of the 
tax and drew away much peopl after him he also perish and 
all even a mani a obey him were disper 

5 38 and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them 
alon for if thi counsel or thi work be of men it will come to 
nought 5 39 but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest hapli 
ye be found even to fight against god 

5 40 and to him they agr and when they had call the apostl 
and beaten them they command that they should not speak in the name 
of jesu and let them go 

5 41 and they depart from the presenc of the council rejoic 
that they were count worthi to suffer shame for hi name 

5 42 and daili in the templ and in everi hou they cea not to 
teach and preach jesu christ 

6 1 and in those day when the number of the discipl wa 
multipli there aro a murmur of the grecian against the 
hebrew becau their widow were neglect in the daili 
ministr 

6 2 then the twelv call the multitud of the discipl unto them 
and said it is not reason that we should leav the word of god and 
serv tabl 

6 3 wherefor brother look ye out among you seven men of honest 
report full of the holi ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over 
thi busi 

6 4 but we will give ourselv continu to prayer and to the 
ministri of the word 

6 5 and the say plea the whole multitud and they chose 
stephen a man full of faith and of the holi ghost and philip and 
prochoru and nicanor and timon and parmena and nicola a 
proselyt of antioch 6 6 whom they set befor the apostl and when 
they had pray they laid their hand on them 

6 7 and the word of god increa and the number of the discipl 
multipli in jerusalem greatli and a great compani of the priest 
were obedi to the faith 

6 8 and stephen full of faith and power did great wonder and 
miracl among the peopl 

6 9 then there aro certain of the synagogu which is call the 
synagogu of the libertin and cyrenian and alexandrian and of 
them of cilicia and of asia disput with stephen 

6 10 and they were not abl to resist the wisdom and the spirit by 
which he spake 

6 11 then they suborn men which said we have heard him speak 
blasphem word against mose and against god 

6 12 and they stir up the peopl and the elder and the scribe 
and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council 
6 13 and set up fal wit which said thi man ceaseth not to 
speak blasphem word against thi holi place and the law 6 14 for 
we have heard him say that thi jesu of nazareth shall destroy thi 
place and shall chang the custom which mose deliv u 

6 15 and all that sat in the council look stedfastli on him saw 
hi face a it had been the face of an angel 

7 1 then said the high priest are these thing so 7 2 and he said 
men brother and father hearken the god of glori appear unto 
our father abraham when he wa in mesopotamia befor he dwelt in 
charran 7 3 and said unto him get thee out of thi countri and from 
thi kindr and come into the land which i shall shew thee 

7 4 then came he out of the land of the chaldaean and dwelt in 
charran and from thenc when hi father wa dead he remov him 
into thi land wherein ye now dwell 

7 5 and he gave him none inherit in it no not so much a to set 
hi foot on yet he promi that he would give it to him for a 
poss and to hi seed after him when a yet he had no child 

7 6 and god spake on thi wise that hi seed should sojourn in a 
strang land and that they should bring them into bondag and 
entreat them evil four hundr year 

7 7 and the nation to whom they shall be in bondag will i judg said 
god and after that shall they come forth and serv me in thi place 

7 8 and he gave him the coven of circumci and so abraham begat 
isaac and circumci him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and 
jacob begat the twelv patriarch 

7 9 and the patriarch move with envi sold joseph into egypt but 
god wa with him 7 10 and deliv him out of all hi afflict 
and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt 
and he made him governor over egypt and all hi hou

13 29 and when they had fulfil all that wa written of him they

13 45 but when the jew saw the multitud they were fill with 
envi and spake against those thing which were spoken by paul 
contradict and blasphem 

13 46 then paul and barnaba wax bold and said it wa necessari 
that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but see 
ye put it from you and judg yourselv unworthi of everlast life 
lo we turn to the gentil 

13 47 for so hath the lord command u say i have set thee to be 
a light of the gentil that thou shouldest be for salvat unto the 
end of the earth 

13 48 and when the gentil heard thi they were glad and glorifi

believ 

13 49 and the word of the lord wa publish throughout all the 
region 

13 50 but the jew stir up the devout and honour woman and the 
chief men of the citi and rai persecut against paul and 
barnaba and expel them out of their coast 

13 51 but they shook off the dust of their foot against them and came

13 52 and the discipl were fill with joy and with the holi ghost 

14 1 and it came to pa in iconium that they went both togeth into 
the synagogu of the jew and so spake that a great multitud both 
of the jew and also of the greek believ 

14 2 but the unbeliev jew stir up the gentil and made their 
mind evil affect against the brother 

14 3 long time therefor abod they speak boldli in the lord which 
gave testimoni unto the word of hi grace and grant sign and 
wonder to be done by their hand 

14 4 but the multitud of the citi wa divid and part held with the 
jew and part with the apostl 

14 5 and when there wa an assault made both of the gentil and also 
of the jew with their ruler to use them despit and to stone 
them 14 6 they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derb 
citi of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about 14 7 
and there they preach the gospel 

14 8 and there sat a certain man at lystra impot in hi foot 
be a crippl from hi mother s womb who never had walk 14 9 the 
same heard paul speak who stedfastli behold him and perceiv 
that he had faith to be heal 14 10 said with a loud voic stand 
upright on thi foot and he leap and walk 

14 11 and when the peopl saw what paul had done they lift up their 
voic say in the speech of lycaonia the god are come down to u 
in the like of men 

14 12 and they call barnaba jupit and paul mercuriu becau 
he wa the chief speaker 

14 13 then the priest of jupit which wa befor their citi brought 
ox and garland unto the gate and would have done sacrif with 
the peopl 

14 14 which when the apostl barnaba and paul heard of they rent 
their cloth and ran in among the peopl cri out 14 15 and 
say sir whi do ye these thing we also are men of like passion 
with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vaniti 
unto the live god which made heaven and earth and the sea and 
all thing that are therein 14 16 who in time past suffer all 
nation to walk in their own way 

14 17 nevertheless he left not himself without wit in that he did 
good and gave u rain from heaven and fruit season fill our 
heart with food and glad 

14 18 and with these say scarc restrain they the peopl that 
they had not done sacrif unto them 

14 19 and there came thither certain jew from antioch and iconium 
who persuad the peopl and have stone paul drew him out of the 
citi suppo he had been dead 

14 20 howbeit a the discipl stood round about him he rose up and 
came into the citi and the next day he depart with barnaba to 
derb 

14 21 and when they had preach the gospel to that citi and had 
taught mani they return again to lystra and to iconium and 
antioch 14 22 confirm the soul of the discipl and exhort 
them to continu in the faith and that we must through much 
tribul enter into the kingdom of god 

14 23 and when they had ordain them elder in everi church and had 
pray with fast they commend them to the lord on whom they 
believ 

14 24 and after they had pa throughout pisidia they came to 
pamphylia 

14 25 and when they had preach the word in perga they went down 
into attalia 14 26 and thenc sail to antioch from whenc they had 
been recommend to the grace of god for the work which they 
fulfil 

14 27 and when they were come and had gather the church togeth 
they rehear all that god had done with them and how he had open 
the door of faith unto the gentil 

14 28 and there they abod long time with the discipl 

15 1 and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brother 
and said except ye be circumci after the manner of mose ye 
cannot be save 

15 2 when therefor paul and barnaba had no small dissen and 
disput with them they determin that paul and barnaba and 
certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostl and 
elder about thi question 

15 3 and be brought on their way by the church they pa through 
phenic and samaria declar the conver of the gentil and 
they cau great joy unto all the brother 

15 4 and when they were come to jerusalem they were receiv of the 
church and of the apostl and elder and they declar all thing 
that god had done with them 

15 5 but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharis which 
believ say that it wa need to circumci them and to 
command them to keep the law of mose 

15 6 and the apostl and elder came togeth for to consid of thi 
matter 

15 7 and when there had been much disput peter rose up and said 
unto them men and brother ye know how that a good while ago god 
made choic among u that the gentil by my mouth should hear the 
word of the gospel and believ 

15 8 and god which knoweth the heart bare them wit give them 
the holi ghost even a he did unto u 15 9 and put no differ 
between u and them purifi their heart by faith 

15 10 now therefor whi tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of 
the discipl which neither our father nor we were abl to bear 
15 11 but we believ that through the grace of the lord jesu christ 
we shall be save even a they 

15 12 then all the multitud kept silenc and gave audienc to 
barnaba and paul declar what miracl and wonder god had wrought 
among the gentil by them 

15 13 and after they had held their peac jame answer say men 
and brother hearken unto me 15 14 simeon hath declar how god at 
the first did visit the gentil to take out of them a peopl for hi 
name 

15 15 and to thi agr the word of the prophet a it is written 
15 16 after thi i will return and will build again the tabernacl of 
david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruin thereof 
and i will set it up 15 17 that the residu of men might seek after 
the lord and all the gentil upon whom my name is call saith the 
lord who doeth all these thing 

15 18 known unto god are all hi work from the begin of the 
world 

15 19 wherefor my sentenc is that we troubl not them which from 
among the gentil are turn to god 15 20 but that we write unto 
them that they abstain from pollut of idol and from 
fornic and from thing strangl and from blood 

15 21 for mose of old time hath in everi citi them that preach him 
be read in the synagogu everi sabbath day 

15 22 then plea it the apostl and elder with the whole church 
to send chosen men of their own compani to antioch with paul and 
barnaba name juda surnam barsaba and sila chief men among 
the brother 15 23 and they wrote letter by them after thi manner 
the apostl and elder and brother send greet unto the brother 
which are of the gentil in antioch and syria and cilicia 

15 24 forasmuch a we have heard that certain which went out from u 
have troubl you with word subvert your soul say ye must 
be circumci and keep the law to whom we gave no such command 
15 25 it seem good unto u be assembl with one accord to send 
chosen men unto you with our belov barnaba and paul 15 26 men that 
have hazard their life for the name of our lord jesu christ 

15 27 we have sent therefor juda and sila who shall also tell you 
the same thing by mouth 

15 28 for it seem good to the holi ghost and to u to lay upon you 
no greater burden than these necessari thing 15 29 that ye abstain 
from meat offer to idol and from blood and from thing 
strangl and from fornic from which if ye keep yourselv ye 
shall do well fare ye well 

15 30 so when they were dismiss they came to antioch and when they 
had gather the multitud togeth they deliv the epistl 15 31 
which when they had read they rejoic for the consol 

15 32 and juda and sila be prophet also themselv exhort 
the brother with mani word and confirm them 

15 33 and after they had tarri there a space they were let go in 
peac from the brother unto the apostl 

15 34 notwithstand it plea sila to abid there still 

15 35 paul also and barnaba continu in antioch teach and 
preach the word of the lord with mani other also 

15 36 and some day after paul said unto barnaba let u go again and 
visit our brother in everi citi where we have preach the word of 
the lord and see how they do 

15 37 and barnaba determin to take with them john whose surnam 
wa mark 

15 38 but paul thought not good to take him with them who depart 
from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work 

15 39 and the content wa so sharp between them that they depart 
asund one from the other and so barnaba took mark and sail unto 
cypru 15 40 and paul chose sila and depart be recommend by 
the brother unto the grace of god 

15 41 and he went through syria and cilicia confirm the church 

16 1 then came he to derb and lystra and behold a certain discipl 
wa there name timotheu the son of a certain woman which wa a 
jewess and believ but hi father wa a greek 16 2 which wa well 
report of by the brother that were at lystra and iconium 

16 3 him would paul have to go forth with him and took and 
circumci him becau of the jew which were in those quarter for 
they knew all that hi father wa a greek 

16 4 and a they went through the citi they deliv them the 
decr for to keep that were ordain of the apostl and elder 
which were at jerusalem 

16 5 and so were the church establish in the faith and increa 
in number daili 

16 6 now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of 
galatia and were forbidden of the holi ghost to preach the word in 
asia 16 7 after they were come to mysia they assay to go into 
bithynia but the spirit suffer them not 

16 8 and they pa by mysia came down to troa 

16 9 and a vision appear to paul in the night there stood a man of 
macedonia and pray him say come over into macedonia and help 
u 

16 10 and after he had seen the vision immedi we endeavour to 
go into macedonia assuredli gather that the lord had call u for 
to preach the gospel unto them 

16 11 therefor loo from troa we came with a straight cour to 
samothracia and the next day to neapoli 16 12 and from thenc to 
philippi which is the chief citi of that part of macedonia and a 
coloni and we were in that citi abid certain day 

16 13 and on the sabbath we went out of the citi by a river side 
where prayer wa wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the 
woman which resort thither 

16 14 and a certain woman name lydia a seller of purpl of the citi 
of thyatira which worship god heard u whose heart the lord 
open that she attend unto the thing which were spoken of paul 

16 15 and when she wa baptiz and her household she besought u 
say if ye have judg me to be faith to the lord come into my 
hou and abid there and she constrain u 

16 16 and it came to pa a we went to prayer a certain damsel 
poss with a spirit of divin met u which brought her 
master much gain by soothsay 16 17 the same follow paul and u 
and cri say these men are the servant of the most high god 
which shew unto u the way of salvat 

16 18 and thi did she mani day but paul be griev turn and 
said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesu christ to come 
out of her 

and he came out the same hour 

16 19 and when her master saw that the hope of their gain wa gone 
they caught paul and sila and drew them into the marketplac unto 
the ruler 16 20 and brought them to the magistr say these 
men be jew do exceedingli troubl our citi 16 21 and teach 
custom which are not law for u to receiv neither to observ 
be roman 

16 22 and the multitud rose up togeth against them and the 
magistr rent off their cloth and command to beat them 

16 23 and when they had laid mani stripe upon them they cast them 
into prison charg the jailor to keep them safe 16 24 who 
have receiv such a charg thrust them into the inner prison and 
made their foot fast in the stock 

16 25 and at midnight paul and sila pray and sang prai unto 
god and the prison heard them 

16 26 and suddenli there wa a great earthquak so that the 
foundat of the prison were shaken and immedi all the door 
were open and everi one s band were loo 

16 27 and the keeper of the prison awak out of hi sleep and 
see the prison door open he drew out hi sword and would have 
kill himself suppo that the prison had been fled 

16 28 but paul cri with a loud voic say do thyself no harm 
for we are all here 

16 29 then he call for a light and sprang in and came trembl 
and fell down befor paul and sila 16 30 and brought them out and 
said sir what must i do to be save 16 31 and they said believ 
on the lord jesu christ and thou shalt be save and thi hou 

16 32 and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that 
were in hi hou 

16 33 and he took them the same hour of the night and wash their 
stripe and wa baptiz he and all hi straightway 

16 34 and when he had brought them into hi hou he set meat befor 
them and rejoic believ in god with all hi hou 

16 35 and when it wa day the magistr sent the serjeant say 
let those men go 

16 36 and the keeper of the prison told thi say to paul the 
magistr have sent to let you go now therefor depart and go in 
peac 

16 37 but paul said unto them they have beaten u openli uncondemn 
be roman and have cast u into prison and now do they thrust u 
out privili nay verili but let them come themselv and fetch u

16 38 and the serjeant told these word unto the magistr and 
they fear when they heard that they were roman 

16 39 and they came and besought them and brought them out and 
desir them to depart out of the citi 

16 40 and they went out of the prison and enter into the hou of 
lydia and when they had seen the brother they comfort them and 
depart 

17 1 now when they had pa through amphipoli and apollonia they 
came to thessalonica where wa a synagogu of the jew 17 2 and 
paul a hi manner wa went in unto them and three sabbath day 
reason with them out of the scriptur 17 3 open and alleg

and that thi jesu whom i preach unto you is christ 

17 4 and some of them believ and consort with paul and sila and

17 5 but the jew which believ not move with envi took unto them 
certain lewd fellow of the baser sort and gather a compani and 
set all the citi on an uproar and assault the hou of jason and 
sought to bring them out to the peopl 

17 6 and when they found them not they drew jason and certain 
brother unto the ruler of the citi cri these that have turn 
the world upsid down are come hither also 17 7 whom jason hath 
receiv and these all do contrari to the decr of caesar say 
that there is anoth king one jesu 

17 8 and they troubl the peopl and the ruler of the citi when 
they heard these thing 

17 9 and when they had taken secur of jason and of the other they 
let them go 

17 10 and the brother immedi sent away paul and sila by night 
unto berea who come thither went into the synagogu of the jew 

17 11 these were more nobl than those in thessalonica in that they 
receiv the word with all readi of mind and search the 
scriptur daili whether those thing were so 

17 12 therefor mani of them believ also of honour woman which 
were greek and of men not a few 

17 13 but when the jew of thessalonica had knowledg that the word of 
god wa preach of paul at berea they came thither also and stir

17 14 and then immedi the brother sent away paul to go a it 
were to the sea but sila and timotheu abod there still 

17 15 and they that conduct paul brought him unto athen and 
receiv a command unto sila and timotheu for to come to him 
with all speed they depart 

17 16 now while paul wait for them at athen hi spirit wa stir 
in him when he saw the citi wholli given to idolatri 

17 17 therefor disput he in the synagogu with the jew and with 
the devout person and in the market daili with them that met with

17 18 then certain philosoph of the epicurean and of the stoick 
encount him and some said what will thi babbler say other 
some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strang god becau he 
preach unto them jesu and the resurrect 

17 19 and they took him and brought him unto areopagu say may 
we know what thi new doctrin whereof thou speakest is 17 20 for 
thou bringest certain strang thing to our ear we would know 
therefor what these thing mean 

17 21 for all the athenian and stranger which were there spent 
their time in noth el but either to tell or to hear some new 
thing 17 22 then paul stood in the midst of mar hill and said 
ye men of athen i perceiv that in all thing ye are too 
superst 

17 23 for a i pa by and beheld your devot i found an altar 
with thi inscript to the unknown god whom therefor ye 
ignorantli worship him declar i unto you 

17 24 god that made the world and all thing therein see that he 
is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in templ made with hand 
17 25 neither is worship with men s hand a though he need ani 
thing see he giveth to all life and breath and all thing 17 26 
and hath made of one blood all nation of men for to dwell on all the 
face of the earth and hath determin the time befor appoint and 
the bound of their habit 17 27 that they should seek the lord 
if hapli they might feel after him and find him though he be not far 
from everi one of u 17 28 for in him we live and move and have our 
be a certain also of your own poet have said for we are also 
hi offspr 

17 29 forasmuch then a we are the offspr of god we ought not to 
think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven 
by art and man s devic 

17 30 and the time of thi ignor god wink at but now 
commandeth all men everi where to repent 17 31 becau he hath 
appoint a day in the which he will judg the world in righteou 
by that man whom he hath ordain whereof he hath given assur 
unto all men in that he hath rai him from the dead 

17 32 and when they heard of the resurrect of the dead some 
mock and other said we will hear thee again of thi matter 

17 33 so paul depart from among them 

17 34 howbeit certain men clave unto him and believ among the

other with them 

18 1 after these thing paul depart from athen and came to

18 11 and he continu there a year and six month teach the word 
of god among them 

18 12 and when gallio wa the deputi of achaia the jew made 
insurrect with one accord against paul and brought him to the 
judgment seat 18 13 say thi fellow persuadeth men to worship god 
contrari to the law 

18 14 and when paul wa now about to open hi mouth gallio said unto 
the jew if it were a matter of wrong or wick lewd o ye jew 
reason would that i should bear with you 18 15 but if it be a 
question of word and name and of your law look ye to it for i 
will be no judg of such matter 

18 16 and he drave them from the judgment seat 

18 17 then all the greek took sosthen the chief ruler of the 
synagogu and beat him befor the judgment seat and gallio care for 
none of those thing 

18 18 and paul after thi tarri there yet a good while and then 
took hi leav of the brother and sail thenc into syria and with 
him priscilla and aquila have shorn hi head in cenchrea for he 
had a vow 

18 19 and he came to ephesu and left them there but he himself 
enter into the synagogu and reason with the jew 

18 20 when they desir him to tarri longer time with them he 
consent not 18 21 but bade them farewel say i must by all 
mean keep thi feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return 
again unto you if god will and he sail from ephesu 

18 22 and when he had land at caesarea and gone up and salut the 
church he went down to antioch 

18 23 and after he had spent some time there he depart and went 
over all the countri of galatia and phrygia in order strengthen 
all the discipl 

18 24 and a certain jew name apollo born at alexandria an eloqu 
man and mighti in the scriptur came to ephesu 

18 25 thi man wa instruct in the way of the lord and be 
fervent in the spirit he spake and taught dilig the thing of 
the lord know onli the baptism of john 

18 26 and he began to speak boldli in the synagogu whom when aquila 
and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expound unto 
him the way of god more perfectli 

18 27 and when he wa dispo to pa into achaia the brother 
wrote exhort the discipl to receiv him who when he wa come 
help them much which had believ through grace 18 28 for he 
mightili convinc the jew and that publickli shew by the 
scriptur that jesu wa christ 

19 1 and it came to pa that while apollo wa at corinth paul 
have pa through the upper coast came to ephesu and find 
certain discipl 19 2 he said unto them have ye receiv the holi 
ghost sinc ye believ and they said unto him we have not so much 
a heard whether there be ani holi ghost 

19 3 and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptiz and they 
said unto john s baptism 

19 4 then said paul john verili baptiz with the baptism of 
repent say unto the peopl that they should believ on him 
which should come after him that is on christ jesu 

19 5 when they heard thi they were baptiz in the name of the lord 
jesu 

19 6 and when paul had laid hi hand upon them the holi ghost came 
on them and they spake with tongu and prophesi 

19 7 and all the men were about twelv 

19 8 and he went into the synagogu and spake boldli for the space of 
three month disput and persuad the thing concern the 
kingdom of god 

19 9 but when diver were harden and believ not but spake evil 
of that way befor the multitud he depart from them and separ 
the discipl disput daili in the school of one tyrannu 

19 10 and thi continu by the space of two year so that all they 
which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesu both jew and 
greek 

19 11 and god wrought special miracl by the hand of paul 19 12 so 
that from hi bodi were brought unto the sick handkerchief or apron 
and the disea depart from them and the evil spirit went out of 
them 

19 13 then certain of the vagabond jew exorcist took upon them to 
call over them which had evil spirit the name of the lord jesu 
say we adjur you by jesu whom paul preacheth 

19 14 and there were seven son of one sceva a jew and chief of the 
priest which did so 

19 15 and the evil spirit answer and said jesu i know and paul i 
know but who are ye 19 16 and the man in whom the evil spirit wa 
leap on them and overcam them and prevail against them so that 
they fled out of that hou nake and wound 

19 17 and thi wa known to all the jew and greek also dwell at 
ephesu and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesu wa 
magnifi 

19 18 and mani that believ came and confess and shew their 
deed 

19 19 mani of them also which use curiou art brought their book 
togeth and burn them befor all men and they count the price 
of them and found it fifti thousand piec of silver 

19 20 so mightili grew the word of god and prevail 

19 21 after these thing were end paul purpo in the spirit when 
he had pa through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem 
say after i have been there i must also see rome 

19 22 so he sent into macedonia two of them that minist unto him 
timotheu and erastu but he himself stay in asia for a season 

19 23 and the same time there aro no small stir about that way 

19 24 for a certain man name demetriu a silversmith which made 
silver shrine for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsman 
19 25 whom he call togeth with the workman of like occup and 
said sir ye know that by thi craft we have our wealth 

19 26 moreov ye see and hear that not alon at ephesu but almost 
throughout all asia thi paul hath persuad and turn away much 
peopl say that they be no god which are made with hand 19 27 
so that not onli thi our craft is in danger to be set at nought but 
also that the templ of the great goddess diana should be despi 
and her magnif should be destroy whom all asia and the world 
worshippeth 

19 28 and when they heard these say they were full of wrath and 
cri out say great is diana of the ephesian 

19 29 and the whole citi wa fill with confu and have caught 
gaiu and aristarchu men of macedonia paul s companion in travel 
they rush with one accord into the theatr 

19 30 and when paul would have enter in unto the peopl the 
discipl suffer him not 

19 31 and certain of the chief of asia which were hi friend sent 
unto him desir him that he would not adventur himself into the 
theatr 

19 32 some therefor cri one thing and some anoth for the 
assembl wa confu and the more part knew not wherefor they were 
come togeth 

19 33 and they drew alexand out of the multitud the jew put 
him forward and alexand beckon with the hand and would have made 
hi defenc unto the peopl 

19 34 but when they knew that he wa a jew all with one voic about 
the space of two hour cri out great is diana of the ephesian 

19 35 and when the townclerk had appea the peopl he said ye men 
of ephesu what man is there that knoweth not how that the citi of 
the ephesian is a worshipp of the great goddess diana and of the 
imag which fell down from jupit 19 36 see then that these 
thing cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do 
noth rashli 

19 37 for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robber 
of church nor yet blasphem of your goddess 

19 38 wherefor if demetriu and the craftsman which are with him 
have a matter against ani man the law is open and there are 
deputi let them implead one anoth 

19 39 but if ye enquir ani thing concern other matter it shall 
be determin in a law assembl 

19 40 for we are in danger to be call in question for thi day s 
uproar there be no cau wherebi we may give an account of thi 
concour 

19 41 and when he had thu spoken he dismiss the assembl 

20 1 and after the uproar wa cea paul call unto him the 
discipl and embrac them and depart for to go into macedonia 

20 2 and when he had gone over those part and had given them much 
exhort he came into greec 20 3 and there abod three month 
and when the jew laid wait for him a he wa about to sail into 
syria he purpo to return through macedonia 

20 4 and there accompani him into asia sopat of berea and of the 
thessalonian aristarchu and secundu and gaiu of derb and 
timotheu and of asia tychicu and trophimu 

20 5 these go befor tarri for u at troa 

20 6 and we sail away from philippi after the day of unleaven 
bread and came unto them to troa in five day where we abod seven 
day 

20 7 and upon the first day of the week when the discipl came 
togeth to break bread paul preach unto them readi to depart on 
the morrow and continu hi speech until midnight 

20 8 and there were mani light in the upper chamber where they were 
gather togeth 

20 9 and there sat in a window a certain young man name eutychu 
be fallen into a deep sleep and a paul wa long preach he 
sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and wa taken 
up dead 

20 10 and paul went down and fell on him and embrac him said 
troubl not yourselv for hi life is in him 

20 11 when he therefor wa come up again and had broken bread and 
eaten and talk a long while even till break of day so he

20 12 and they brought the young man aliv and were not a littl 
comfort 

20 13 and we went befor to ship and sail unto asso there 
intend to take in paul for so had he appoint mind himself to 
go afoot 

20 14 and when he met with u at asso we took him in and came to 
mitylen 

20 15 and we sail thenc and came the next day over against chio 
and the next day we arriv at samo and tarri at trogyllium and 
the next day we came to miletu 

20 16 for paul had determin to sail by ephesu becau he would not 
spend the time in asia for he hast if it were possibl for him to 
be at jerusalem the day of pentecost 

20 17 and from miletu he sent to ephesu and call the elder of 
the church 

20 18 and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from 
the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been 
with you at all season 20 19 serv the lord with all humil of 
mind and with mani tear and temptat which befel me by the 
lie in wait of the jew 20 20 and how i kept back noth that wa 
profit unto you but have shew you and have taught you 
publickli and from hou to hou 20 21 testifi both to the jew 
and also to the greek repent toward god and faith toward our 
lord jesu christ 

20 22 and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not 
know the thing that shall befal me there 20 23 save that the 
holi ghost witnesseth in everi citi say that bond and afflict 
abid me 

20 24 but none of these thing move me neither count i my life dear 
unto myself so that i might finish my cour with joy and the 
ministri which i have receiv of the lord jesu to testifi the 
gospel of the grace of god 

20 25 and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone 
preach the kingdom of god shall see my face no more 

20 26 wherefor i take you to record thi day that i am pure from the 
blood of all men 

20 27 for i have not shun to declar unto you all the counsel of 
god 

20 28 take heed therefor unto yourselv and to all the flock over 
the which the holi ghost hath made you over to feed the church 
of god which he hath purcha with hi own blood 

20 29 for i know thi that after my depart shall grievou wolf 
enter in among you not spare the flock 

20 30 also of your own self shall men ari speak perver 
thing to draw away discipl after them 

20 31 therefor watch and rememb that by the space of three year 
i cea not to warn everi one night and day with tear 

20 32 and now brother i commend you to god and to the word of hi 
grace which is abl to build you up and to give you an inherit 
among all them which are sanctifi 

20 33 i have covet no man s silver or gold or apparel 

20 34 yea ye yourselv know that these hand have minist unto 
my necess and to them that were with me 

20 35 i have shew you all thing how that so labour ye ought to 
support the weak and to rememb the word of the lord jesu how he 
said it is more bless to give than to receiv 

20 36 and when he had thu spoken he kneel down and pray with 
them all 

20 37 and they all wept sore and fell on paul s neck and kiss him 
20 38 sorrow most of all for the word which he spake that they 
should see hi face no more and they accompani him unto the ship 

21 1 and it came to pa that after we were gotten from them and had 
launch we came with a straight cour unto coo and the day 
follow unto rhode and from thenc unto patara 21 2 and find a 
ship sail over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth 

21 3 now when we had discov cypru we left it on the left hand 
and sail into syria and land at tyre for there the ship wa to 
unlad her burden 

21 4 and find discipl we tarri there seven day who said to 
paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem 

21 5 and when we had accomplish those day we depart and went our 
way and they all brought u on our way with wife and child till 
we were out of the citi and we kneel down on the shore and pray 

21 6 and when we had taken our leav one of anoth we took ship and 
they return home again 

21 7 and when we had finish our cour from tyre we came to 
ptolemai and salut the brother and abod with them one day 

21 8 and the next day we that were of paul s compani depart and 
came unto caesarea and we enter into the hou of philip the 
evangelist which wa one of the seven and abod with him 

21 9 and the same man had four daughter virgin which did prophesi 

21 10 and a we tarri there mani day there came down from judaea a 
certain prophet name agabu 

21 11 and when he wa come unto u he took paul s girdl and bound 
hi own hand and foot and said thu saith the holi ghost so shall 
the jew at jerusalem bind the man that owneth thi girdl and shall 
deliv him into the hand of the gentil 

21 12 and when we heard these thing both we and they of that place 
besought him not to go up to jerusalem 

21 13 then paul answer what mean ye to weep and to break mine 
heart for i am readi not to be bound onli but also to die at 
jerusalem for the name of the lord jesu 

21 14 and when he would not be persuad we cea say the will 
of the lord be done 

21 15 and after those day we took up our carriag and went up to 
jerusalem 

21 16 there went with u also certain of the discipl of caesarea 
and brought with them one mnason of cypru an old discipl with whom 
we should lodg 

21 17 and when we were come to jerusalem the brother receiv u

the elder were present 

21 19 and when he had salut them he declar particularli what 
thing god had wrought among the gentil by hi ministri 

21 20 and when they heard it they glorifi the lord and said unto 
him thou seest brother how mani thousand of jew there are which 
believ and they are all zealou of the law 21 21 and they are 
inform of thee that thou teachest all the jew which are among the 
gentil to forsak mose say that they ought not to circumci 
their child neither to walk after the custom 

21 22 what is it therefor the multitud must need come togeth 
for they will hear that thou art come 

21 23 do therefor thi that we say to thee we have four men which 
have a vow on them 21 24 them take and purifi thyself with them and 
be at charg with them that they may shave their head and all may 
know that those thing whereof they were inform concern thee

21 25 a touch the gentil which believ we have written and 
conclud that they observ no such thing save onli that they keep 
themselv from thing offer to idol and from blood and from

21 27 and when the seven day were almost end the jew which were

21 30 and all the citi wa move and the peopl ran togeth and 
they took paul and drew him out of the templ and forthwith the

madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilder four thousand 
men that were murder 21 39 but paul said i am a man which am a 
jew of tarsu a citi in cilicia a citizen of no mean citi and i

22 6 and it came to pa that a i made my journey and wa come 
nigh unto damascu about noon suddenli there shone from heaven a 
great light round about me 

22 7 and i fell unto the ground and heard a voic say unto me 
saul saul whi persecutest thou me 22 8 and i answer who art 
thou lord and he said unto me i am jesu of nazareth whom thou 
persecutest 

22 9 and they that were with me saw ind the light and were afraid 
but they heard not the voic of him that spake to me 

22 10 and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me

22 23 and a they cri out and cast off their cloth and threw 
dust into the air 22 24 the chief captain command him to be brought 
into the castl and bade that he should be examin by scourg 
that he might know wherefor they cri so against him 

22 25 and a they bound him with thong paul said unto the centurion

and uncondemn 22 26 when the centurion heard that he went and 
told the chief captain say take heed what thou doest for thi

22 30 on the morrow becau he would have known the certainti 
wherefor he wa accu of the jew he loo him from hi band 
and command the chief priest and all their council to appear and

for sittest thou to judg me after the law and commandest me to be 
smitten contrari to the law 23 4 and they that stood by said 
revilest thou god s high priest 23 5 then said paul i wist not

23 6 but when paul perceiv that the one part were sadduc and the 
other pharis he cri out in the council men and brother i am a

went and enter into the castl and told paul 

23 17 then paul call one of the centurion unto him and said bring 
thi young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to

23 23 and he call unto him two centurion say make readi two 
hundr soldier to go to caesarea and horseman threescor and ten 
and spearmen two hundr at the third hour of the night 23 24 and 
provid them beast that they may set paul on and bring him safe 
unto felix the governor 

23 25 and he wrote a letter after thi manner 23 26 claudiu lysia 
unto the most excel governor felix sendeth greet 

23 27 thi man wa taken of the jew and should have been kill of 
them then came i with an armi and rescu him have understood 
that he wa a roman 

23 28 and when i would have known the cau wherefor they accu 
him i brought him forth into their council 23 29 whom i perceiv to 
be accu of question of their law but to have noth laid to hi 
charg worthi of death or of bond 

23 30 and when it wa told me how that the jew laid wait for the man 
i sent straightway to thee and gave command to hi accu also 
to say befor thee what they had against him farewel 

23 31 then the soldier a it wa command them took paul and 
brought him by night to antipatri 

23 32 on the morrow they left the horseman to go with him and 
return to the castl 23 33 who when they came to caesarea and 
deliv the epistl to the governor present paul also befor him 

23 34 and when the governor had read the letter he ask of what 
provinc he wa and when he understood that he wa of cilicia 23 35 
i will hear thee said he when thine accu are also come and he 
command him to be kept in herod s judgment hall 

24 1 and after five day anania the high priest descend with the 
elder and with a certain orat name tertullu who inform the 
governor against paul 

24 2 and when he wa call forth tertullu began to accu him 
say see that by thee we enjoy great quiet and that veri 
worthi deed are done unto thi nation by thi provid 24 3 we 
accept it alway and in all place most nobl felix with all 
thank 

24 4 notwithstand that i be not further tediou unto thee i pray 
thee that thou wouldest hear u of thi clemenc a few word 

24 5 for we have found thi man a pestil fellow and a mover of 
sedit among all the jew throughout the world and a ringlead of 
the sect of the nazaren 24 6 who also hath gone about to profan 
the templ whom we took and would have judg accord to our law 

24 7 but the chief captain lysia came upon u and with great 
violenc took him away out of our hand 24 8 command hi accu 
to come unto thee by examin of whom thyself mayest take knowledg 
of all these thing whereof we accu him 

24 9 and the jew also assent say that these thing were so 

24 10 then paul after that the governor had beckon unto him to 
speak answer forasmuch a i know that thou hast been of mani year 
a judg unto thi nation i do the more cheer answer for myself 
24 11 becau that thou mayest understand that there are yet but 
twelv day sinc i went up to jerusalem for to worship 

24 12 and they neither found me in the templ disput with ani man 
neither rai up the peopl neither in the synagogu nor in the 
citi 24 13 neither can they prove the thing whereof they now accu 
me 

24 14 but thi i confess unto thee that after the way which they call 
heresi so worship i the god of my father believ all thing which 
are written in the law and in the prophet 24 15 and have hope toward 
god which they themselv also allow that there shall be a 
resurrect of the dead both of the just and unjust 

24 16 and herein do i exerci myself to have alway a conscienc 
void to offenc toward god and toward men 

24 17 now after mani year i came to bring alm to my nation and 
offer 

24 18 whereupon certain jew from asia found me purifi in the 
templ neither with multitud nor with tumult 

24 19 who ought to have been here befor thee and object if they had 
ought against me 

24 20 or el let these same here say if they have found ani evil 
do in me while i stood befor the council 24 21 except it be for 
thi one voic that i cri stand among them touch the 
resurrect of the dead i am call in question by you thi day 

24 22 and when felix heard these thing have more perfect knowledg 
of that way he defer them and said when lysia the chief captain 
shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter 

24 23 and he command a centurion to keep paul and to let him have 
liberti and that he should forbid none of hi acquaint to 
minist or come unto him 

24 24 and after certain day when felix came with hi wife drusilla 
which wa a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concern the 
faith in christ 

24 25 and a he reason of righteou temper and judgment to 
come felix trembl and answer go thi way for thi time when i 
have a conveni season i will call for thee 

24 26 he hope also that money should have been given him of paul 
that he might loo him wherefor he sent for him the often and 
commun with him 

24 27 but after two year porciu festu came into felix room and 
felix will to shew the jew a pleasur left paul bound 

25 1 now when festu wa come into the provinc after three day he 
ascend from caesarea to jerusalem 

25 2 then the high priest and the chief of the jew inform him 
against paul and besought him 25 3 and desir favour against him 
that he would send for him to jerusalem lay wait in the way to 
kill him 

25 4 but festu answer that paul should be kept at caesarea and 
that he himself would depart shortli thither 

25 5 let them therefor said he which among you are abl go down 
with me and accu thi man if there be ani wick in him 

25 6 and when he had tarri among them more than ten day he went 
down unto caesarea and the next day sit on the judgment seat 
command paul to be brought 

25 7 and when he wa come the jew which came down from jerusalem 
stood round about and laid mani and grievou complaint against paul 
which they could not prove 

25 8 while he answer for himself neither against the law of the 
jew neither against the templ nor yet against caesar have i 
offend ani thing at all 

25 9 but festu will to do the jew a pleasur answer paul and 
said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judg of these 
thing befor me 25 10 then said paul i stand at caesar s judgment 
seat where i ought to be judg to the jew have i done no wrong a 
thou veri well knowest 

25 11 for if i be an offend or have commit ani thing worthi of 
death i refu not to die but if there be none of these thing 
whereof these accu me no man may deliv me unto them i appeal 
unto caesar 

25 12 then festu when he had confer with the council answer 
hast thou appeal unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go 

25 13 and after certain day king agrippa and bernic came unto 
caesarea to salut festu 

25 14 and when they had been there mani day festu declar paul s 
cau unto the king say there is a certain man left in bond by 
felix 25 15 about whom when i wa at jerusalem the chief priest 
and the elder of the jew inform me desir to have judgment 
against him 

25 16 to whom i answer it is not the manner of the roman to 
deliv ani man to die befor that he which is accu have the 
accu face to face and have licenc to answer for himself 
concern the crime laid against him 

25 17 therefor when they were come hither without ani delay on the 
morrow i sat on the judgment seat and command the man to be brought 
forth 

25 18 against whom when the accu stood up they brought none 
accu of such thing a i suppo 25 19 but had certain 
question against him of their own superstit and of one jesu 
which wa dead whom paul affirm to be aliv 

25 20 and becau i doubt of such manner of question i ask him 
whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judg of these 
matter 

25 21 but when paul had appeal to be reserv unto the hear of 
augustu i command him to be kept till i might send him to caesar 

25 22 then agrippa said unto festu i would also hear the man myself 
to morrow said he thou shalt hear him 

25 23 and on the morrow when agrippa wa come and bernic with 
great pomp and wa enter into the place of hear with the chief 
captain and princip men of the citi at festu command paul 
wa brought forth 

25 24 and festu said king agrippa and all men which are here 
present with u ye see thi man about whom all the multitud of the 
jew have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here cri that 
he ought not to live ani longer 

25 25 but when i found that he had commit noth worthi of death 
and that he himself hath appeal to augustu i have determin to 
send him 

25 26 of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefor 
i have brought him forth befor you and special befor thee o king 
agrippa that after examin had i might have somewhat to write 

25 27 for it seemeth to me unreason to send a prison and not 
withal to signifi the crime laid against him 

26 1 then agrippa said unto paul thou art permit to speak for 
thyself 

then paul stretch forth the hand and answer for himself 26 2 i 
think myself happi king agrippa becau i shall answer for myself 
thi day befor thee touch all the thing whereof i am accu of 
the jew 26 3 especi becau i know thee to be expert in all 
custom and question which are among the jew wherefor i beseech 
thee to hear me patient 

26 4 my manner of life from my youth which wa at the first among 
mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jew 26 5 which knew me 
from the begin if they would testifi that after the most 
straitest sect of our religion i live a pharis 

26 6 and now i stand and am judg for the hope of the promi made of 
god unto our father 26 7 unto which promi our twelv tribe 
instantli serv god day and night hope to come for which hope s 
sake king agrippa i am accu of the jew 

26 8 whi should it be thought a thing incr with you that god 
should rai the dead 26 9 i verili thought with myself that i 
ought to do mani thing contrari to the name of jesu of nazareth 

26 10 which thing i also did in jerusalem and mani of the saint did 
i shut up in prison have receiv author from the chief priest 
and when they were put to death i gave my voic against them 

26 11 and i punish them oft in everi synagogu and compel them 
to blasphem and be exceedingli mad against them i persecut 
them even unto strang citi 

26 12 whereupon a i went to damascu with author and commiss 
from the chief priest 26 13 at midday o king i saw in the way a 
light from heaven abov the bright of the sun shine round 
about me and them which journey with me 

26 14 and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voic 
speak unto me and say in the hebrew tongu saul saul whi 
persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the prick 

26 15 and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesu whom 
thou persecutest 

26 16 but rise and stand upon thi foot for i have appear unto thee 
for thi purpo to make thee a minist and a wit both of these 
thing which thou hast seen and of those thing in the which i will 
appear unto thee 26 17 deliv thee from the peopl and from the 
gentil unto whom now i send thee 26 18 to open their eye and to 
turn them from dark to light and from the power of satan unto 
god that they may receiv forgiv of sin and inherit among 
them which are sanctifi by faith that is in me 

26 19 whereupon o king agrippa i wa not disobedi unto the 
heavenli vision 26 20 but shew first unto them of damascu and at 
jerusalem and throughout all the coast of judaea and then to the 
gentil that they should repent and turn to god and do work meet 
for repent 

26 21 for these cau the jew caught me in the templ and went 
about to kill me 

26 22 have therefor obtain help of god i continu unto thi day 
wit both to small and great say none other thing than 
those which the prophet and mose did say should come 26 23 that 
christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise 
from the dead and should shew light unto the peopl and to the 
gentil 

26 24 and a he thu spake for himself festu said with a loud voic 
paul thou art besid thyself much learn doth make thee mad 

26 25 but he said i am not mad most nobl festu but speak forth 
the word of truth and sober 

26 26 for the king knoweth of these thing befor whom also i speak 
freeli for i am persuad that none of these thing are hidden from 
him for thi thing wa not done in a corner 

26 27 king agrippa believest thou the prophet i know that thou 
believest 

26 28 then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a 
christian 

26 29 and paul said i would to god that not onli thou but also all 
that hear me thi day were both almost and altogeth such a i am 
except these bond 

26 30 and when he had thu spoken the king rose up and the governor 
and bernic and they that sat with them 26 31 and when they were 
gone asid they talk between themselv say thi man doeth 
noth worthi of death or of bond 

26 32 then said agrippa unto festu thi man might have been set at 
liberti if he had not appeal unto caesar 

27 1 and when it wa determin that we should sail into itali they 
deliv paul and certain other prison unto one name juliu a 
centurion of augustu band 

27 2 and enter into a ship of adramyttium we launch mean to 
sail by the coast of asia one aristarchu a macedonian of 
thessalonica be with u 

27 3 and the next day we touch at sidon and juliu courteou 
entreat paul and gave him liberti to go unto hi friend to refresh 
himself 

27 4 and when we had launch from thenc we sail under cypru 
becau the wind were contrari 

27 5 and when we had sail over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we 
came to myra a citi of lycia 

27 6 and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sail into 
itali and he put u therein 

27 7 and when we had sail slowli mani day and scarc were come 
over against cnidu the wind not suffer u we sail under crete 
over against salmon 27 8 and hardli pa it came unto a place 
which is call the fair haven nigh whereunto wa the citi of lasea 

27 9 now when much time wa spent and when sail wa now danger 
becau the fast wa now alreadi past paul admonish them 27 10 and 
said unto them sir i perceiv that thi voyag will be with hurt 
and much damag not onli of the lade and ship but also of our 
life 

27 11 nevertheless the centurion believ the master and the owner of 
the ship more than those thing which were spoken by paul 

27 12 and becau the haven wa not commodi to winter in the more 
part advi to depart thenc also if by ani mean they might attain 
to phenic and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth 
toward the south west and north west 

27 13 and when the south wind blew softli suppo that they had 
obtain their purpo loo thenc they sail close by crete 

27 14 but not long after there aro against it a tempestu wind 
call euroclydon 

27 15 and when the ship wa caught and could not bear up into the 
wind we let her drive 

27 16 and run under a certain island which is call clauda we 
had much work to come by the boat 27 17 which when they had taken up 
they use help undergird the ship and fear lest they should 
fall into the quicksand strake sail and so were driven 

27 18 and we be exceedingli toss with a tempest the next day 
they lighten the ship 27 19 and the third day we cast out with our 
own hand the tackl of the ship 

27 20 and when neither sun nor star in mani day appear and no 
small tempest lay on u all hope that we should be save wa then 
taken away 

27 21 but after long abstin paul stood forth in the midst of them 
and said sir ye should have hearken unto me and not have loo 
from crete and to have gain thi harm and loss 

27 22 and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no 
loss of ani man s life among you but of the ship 

27 23 for there stood by me thi night the angel of god whose i am 
and whom i serv 27 24 say fear not paul thou must be brought 
befor caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with 
thee 

27 25 wherefor sir be of good cheer for i believ god that it 
shall be even a it wa told me 

27 26 howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island 

27 27 but when the fourteenth night wa come a we were driven up and 
down in adria about midnight the shipmen deem that they drew near 
to some countri 27 28 and sound and found it twenti fathom and 
when they had gone a littl further they sound again and found it 
fifteen fathom 

27 29 then fear lest we should have fallen upon rock they cast 
four anchor out of the stern and wish for the day 

27 30 and a the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they 
had let down the boat into the sea under colour a though they would 
have cast anchor out of the foreship 27 31 paul said to the 
centurion and to the soldier except these abid in the ship ye 
cannot be save 

27 32 then the soldier cut off the rope of the boat and let her 
fall off 

27 33 and while the day wa come on paul besought them all to take 
meat say thi day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarri and 
continu fast have taken noth 

27 34 wherefor i pray you to take some meat for thi is for your 
health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of ani of you 

27 35 and when he had thu spoken he took bread and gave thank to 
god in presenc of them all and when he had broken it he began to 
eat 

27 36 then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat 

27 37 and we were in all in the ship two hundr threescor and 
sixteen soul 

27 38 and when they had eaten enough they lighten the ship and 
cast out the wheat into the sea 

27 39 and when it wa day they knew not the land but they discov 
a certain creek with a shore into the which they were mind if it 
were possibl to thrust in the ship 

27 40 and when they had taken up the anchor they commit 
themselv unto the sea and loo the rudder band and hoi up 
the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore 

27 41 and fall into a place where two sea met they ran the ship 
aground and the forepart stuck fast and remain unmov but the 
hinder part wa broken with the violenc of the wave 

27 42 and the soldier counsel wa to kill the prison lest ani of 
them should swim out and escap 

27 43 but the centurion will to save paul kept them from their 
purpo and command that they which could swim should cast 
themselv first into the sea and get to land 27 44 and the rest 
some on board and some on broken piec of the ship 

and so it came to pa that they escap all safe to land 

28 1 and when they were escap then they knew that the island wa 
call melita 

28 2 and the barbar peopl shew u no littl kind for they 
kindl a fire and receiv u everi one becau of the present 
rain and becau of the cold 

28 3 and when paul had gather a bundl of stick and laid them on 
the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fasten on hi 
hand 

28 4 and when the barbarian saw the venom beast hang on hi hand 
they said among themselv no doubt thi man is a murder whom 
though he hath escap the sea yet vengeanc suffereth not to live 

28 5 and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm 

28 6 howbeit they look when he should have swollen or fallen down 
dead suddenli but after they had look a great while and saw no 
harm come to him they chang their mind and said that he wa a 
god 

28 7 in the same quarter were poss of the chief man of the 
island whose name wa publiu who receiv u and lodg u three 
day courteou 

28 8 and it came to pa that the father of publiu lay sick of a 
fever and of a bloodi flux to whom paul enter in and pray and 
laid hi hand on him and heal him 

28 9 so when thi wa done other also which had disea in the 
island came and were heal 28 10 who also honour u with mani 
honour and when we depart they lade u with such thing a were 
necessari 

28 11 and after three month we depart in a ship of alexandria 
which had winter in the isl whose sign wa castor and pollux 

28 12 and land at syracu we tarri there three day 

28 13 and from thenc we fetch a compass and came to rhegium and 
after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to 
puteoli 28 14 where we found brother and were desir to tarri with 
them seven day and so we went toward rome 

28 15 and from thenc when the brother heard of u they came to 
meet u a far a appii forum and the three tavern whom when paul 
saw he thank god and took courag 

28 16 and when we came to rome the centurion deliv the prison 
to the captain of the guard but paul wa suffer to dwell by himself 
with a soldier that kept him 

28 17 and it came to pa that after three day paul call the chief 
of the jew togeth and when they were come togeth he said unto 
them men and brother though i have commit noth against the 
peopl or custom of our father yet wa i deliv prison from 
jerusalem into the hand of the roman 

28 18 who when they had examin me would have let me go becau 
there wa no cau of death in me 

28 19 but when the jew spake against it i wa constrain to appeal 
unto caesar not that i had ought to accu my nation of 

28 20 for thi cau therefor have i call for you to see you and 
to speak with you becau that for the hope of israel i am bound with 
thi chain 

28 21 and they said unto him we neither receiv letter out of 
judaea concern thee neither ani of the brother that came shew 
or spake ani harm of thee 

28 22 but we desir to hear of thee what thou thinkest for a 
concern thi sect we know that everi where it is spoken against 

28 23 and when they had appoint him a day there came mani to him 
into hi lodg to whom he expound and testifi the kingdom of 
god persuad them concern jesu both out of the law of mose 
and out of the prophet from morn till even 

28 24 and some believ the thing which were spoken and some 
believ not 

28 25 and when they agr not among themselv they depart after 
that paul had spoken one word well spake the holi ghost by esaia the 
prophet unto our father 28 26 say go unto thi peopl and say 
hear ye shall hear and shall not understand and see ye shall 
see and not perceiv 28 27 for the heart of thi peopl is wax 
gross and their ear are dull of hear and their eye have they 
close lest they should see with their eye and hear with their 
ear and understand with their heart and should be convert and i 
should heal them 

28 28 be it known therefor unto you that the salvat of god is 
sent unto the gentil and that they will hear it 

28 29 and when he had said these word the jew depart and had 
great reason among themselv 

28 30 and paul dwelt two whole year in hi own hire hou and 
receiv all that came in unto him 28 31 preach the kingdom of 
god and teach those thing which concern the lord jesu christ 
with all confid no man forbid him 




the epistl of paul the apostl to the roman 


1 1 paul a servant of jesu christ call to be an apostl 
separ unto the gospel of god 1 2 which he had promi afor by 
hi prophet in the holi scriptur 1 3 concern hi son jesu 
christ our lord which wa made of the seed of david accord to the 
flesh 1 4 and declar to be the son of god with power accord to 
the spirit of holi by the resurrect from the dead 1 5 by whom 
we have receiv grace and apostleship for obedi to the faith 
among all nation for hi name 1 6 among whom are ye also the call 
of jesu christ 1 7 to all that be in rome belov of god call to 
be saint grace to you and peac from god our father and the lord 
jesu christ 

1 8 first i thank my god through jesu christ for you all that your 
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world 

1 9 for god is my wit whom i serv with my spirit in the gospel 
of hi son that without cea i make mention of you alway in my 
prayer 1 10 make request if by ani mean now at length i might 
have a prosper journey by the will of god to come unto you 

1 11 for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritu 
gift to the end ye may be establish 1 12 that is that i may be 
comfort togeth with you by the mutual faith both of you and me 

1 13 now i would not have you ignor brother that oftentim i 
purpo to come unto you but wa let hitherto that i might have 
some fruit among you also even a among other gentil 

1 14 i am debtor both to the greek and to the barbarian both to 
the wise and to the unwi 

1 15 so a much a in me is i am readi to preach the gospel to you 
that are at rome also 

1 16 for i am not asham of the gospel of christ for it is the power 
of god unto salvat to everi one that believeth to the jew first 
and also to the greek 

1 17 for therein is the righteou of god reveal from faith to 
faith a it is written the just shall live by faith 

1 18 for the wrath of god is reveal from heaven against all 
ungodli and unright of men who hold the truth in 
unright 1 19 becau that which may be known of god is 
manifest in them for god hath shew it unto them 

1 20 for the invi thing of him from the creation of the world 
are clearli seen be understood by the thing that are made even 
hi etern power and godhead so that they are without excu 1 21 
becau that when they knew god they glorifi him not a god 
neither were thank but becam vain in their imagin and 
their foolish heart wa darken 

1 22 profess themselv to be wise they becam fool 1 23 and 
chang the glori of the uncorrupt god into an imag made like to 
corrupt man and to bird and fourfoot beast and creep 
thing 

1 24 wherefor god also gave them up to unclean through the lust 
of their own heart to dishonour their own bodi between themselv 
1 25 who chang the truth of god into a lie and worship and 
serv the creatur more than the creator who is bless for ever 
amen 

1 26 for thi cau god gave them up unto vile affect for even 
their woman did chang the natur use into that which is against 
natur 1 27 and likewi also the men leav the natur use of the 
woman burn in their lust one toward anoth men with men work 
that which is unseemli and receiv in themselv that recomp of 
their error which wa meet 

1 28 and even a they did not like to retain god in their knowledg 
god gave them over to a reprob mind to do those thing which are 
not conveni 1 29 be fill with all unright 
fornic wick covet malici full of envi 
murder debat deceit malign whisper 1 30 backbit hater 
of god despit proud boaster inventor of evil thing 
disobedi to parent 1 31 without understand covenantbreak 
without natur affect implac unmerci 1 32 who know 
the judgment of god that they which commit such thing are worthi of 
death not onli do the same but have pleasur in them that do them 

2 1 therefor thou art inexcu o man whosoev thou art that 
judgest for wherein thou judgest anoth thou condemnest thyself 
for thou that judgest doest the same thing 

2 2 but we are sure that the judgment of god is accord to truth 
against them which commit such thing 

2 3 and thinkest thou thi o man that judgest them which do such 
thing and doest the same that thou shalt escap the judgment of 
god 2 4 or despisest thou the rich of hi good and forbear 
and longsuff not know that the good of god leadeth thee 
to repent 2 5 but after thi hard and impenit heart 
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and 
revel of the righteou judgment of god 2 6 who will render to 
everi man accord to hi deed 2 7 to them who by patient 
continu in well do seek for glori and honour and immort 
etern life 2 8 but unto them that are contenti and do not obey 
the truth but obey unright indign and wrath 2 9 
tribul and anguish upon everi soul of man that doeth evil of 
the jew first and also of the gentil 2 10 but glori honour and 
peac to everi man that worketh good to the jew first and also to 
the gentil 2 11 for there is no respect of person with god 

2 12 for a mani a have sin without law shall also perish without 
law and a mani a have sin in the law shall be judg by the law 
2 13 for not the hearer of the law are just befor god but the 
doer of the law shall be justifi 

2 14 for when the gentil which have not the law do by natur the 
thing contain in the law these have not the law are a law unto 
themselv 2 15 which shew the work of the law written in their 
heart their conscienc also bear wit and their thought the 
mean while accu or el excu one anoth 2 16 in the day 
when god shall judg the secret of men by jesu christ accord to 
my gospel 

2 17 behold thou art call a jew and restest in the law and makest 
thi boast of god 2 18 and knowest hi will and approvest the thing 
that are more excel be instruct out of the law 2 19 and art 
confid that thou thyself art a guid of the blind a light of them 
which are in dark 2 20 an instructor of the foolish a teacher of 
babe which hast the form of knowledg and of the truth in the law 

2 21 thou therefor which teachest anoth teachest thou not thyself 
thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal 2 22 
thou that sayest a man should not commit adulteri dost thou commit 
adulteri thou that abhorrest idol dost thou commit sacrileg 2 23 
thou that makest thi boast of the law through break the law 
dishonourest thou god 2 24 for the name of god is blasphem among 
the gentil through you a it is written 

2 25 for circumci verili profiteth if thou keep the law but if 
thou be a breaker of the law thi circumci is made uncircumci 

2 26 therefor if the uncircumci keep the righteou of the 
law shall not hi uncircumci be count for circumci 2 27 
and shall not uncircumci which is by natur if it fulfil the law 
judg thee who by the letter and circumci dost transgress the 
law 2 28 for he is not a jew which is one outwardli neither is 
that circumci which is outward in the flesh 2 29 but he is a 
jew which is one inwardli and circumci is that of the heart in 
the spirit and not in the letter whose prai is not of men but of 
god 

3 1 what advantag then hath the jew or what profit is there of 
circumci 3 2 much everi way chiefli becau that unto them 
were commit the oracl of god 

3 3 for what if some did not believ shall their unbelief make the 
faith of god without effect 3 4 god forbid yea let god be true 
but everi man a liar a it is written that thou mightest be 
justifi in thi say and mightest overcom when thou art judg 

3 5 but if our unright commend the righteou of god what 
shall we say is god unright who taketh vengeanc i speak a a 
man 3 6 god forbid for then how shall god judg the world 3 7 for 
if the truth of god hath more abound through my lie unto hi glori 
whi yet am i also judg a a sinner 3 8 and not rather a we be 
slander report and a some affirm that we say let u do 
evil that good may come whose damnat is just 

3 9 what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have 
befor prove both jew and gentil that they are all under sin 
3 10 a it is written there is none righteou no not one 3 11 
there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after 
god 

3 12 they are all gone out of the way they are togeth becom 
unprofit there is none that doeth good no not one 

3 13 their throat is an open sepulchr with their tongu they have 
use deceit the poison of asp is under their lip 3 14 whose mouth 
is full of cur and bitter 3 15 their foot are swift to shed 
blood 3 16 destruct and miseri are in their way 3 17 and the way 
of peac have they not known 3 18 there is no fear of god befor 
their eye 

3 19 now we know that what thing soever the law saith it saith to 
them who are under the law that everi mouth may be stop and all 
the world may becom guilti befor god 

3 20 therefor by the deed of the law there shall no flesh be 
justifi in hi sight for by the law is the knowledg of sin 

3 21 but now the righteou of god without the law is manifest 
be wit by the law and the prophet 3 22 even the 
righteou of god which is by faith of jesu christ unto all and 
upon all them that believ for there is no differ 3 23 for all 
have sin and come short of the glori of god 3 24 be justifi 
freeli by hi grace through the redempt that is in christ jesu 
3 25 whom god hath set forth to be a propiti through faith in hi 
blood to declar hi righteou for the remiss of sin that are 
past through the forbear of god 3 26 to declar i say at thi 
time hi righteou that he might be just and the justifi of 
him which believeth in jesu 

3 27 where is boast then it is exclud by what law of work 
nay but by the law of faith 

3 28 therefor we conclud that a man is justifi by faith without 
the deed of the law 

3 29 is he the god of the jew onli is he not also of the gentil 
ye of the gentil also 3 30 see it is one god which shall 
justifi the circumci by faith and uncircumci through faith 

3 31 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we 
establish the law 

4 1 what shall we say then that abraham our father a pertain to 
the flesh hath found 4 2 for if abraham were justifi by work he 
hath whereof to glori but not befor god 

4 3 for what saith the scriptur abraham believ god and it wa 
count unto him for righteou 

4 4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but 
of debt 

4 5 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth 
the ungodli hi faith is count for righteou 

4 6 even a david also describeth the bless of the man unto 
whom god imputeth righteou without work 4 7 say bless are 
they whose iniqu are forgiven and whose sin are cover 

4 8 bless is the man to whom the lord will not imput sin 

4 9 cometh thi bless then upon the circumci onli or upon 
the uncircumci also for we say that faith wa reckon to abraham 
for righteou 

4 10 how wa it then reckon when he wa in circumci or in 
uncircumci not in circumci but in uncircumci 

4 11 and he receiv the sign of circumci a seal of the 
righteou of the faith which he had yet be uncircumci that 
he might be the father of all them that believ though they be not 
circumci that righteou might be imput unto them also 4 12 
and the father of circumci to them who are not of the circumci 
onli but who also walk in the step of that faith of our father 
abraham which he had be yet uncircumci 

4 13 for the promi that he should be the heir of the world wa not 
to abraham or to hi seed through the law but through the 
righteou of faith 

4 14 for if they which are of the law be heir faith is made void 
and the promi made of none effect 4 15 becau the law worketh 
wrath for where no law is there is no transgress 

4 16 therefor it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end 
the promi might be sure to all the seed not to that onli which is 
of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is 
the father of u all 4 17 a it is written i have made thee a 
father of mani nation befor him whom he believ even god who 
quickeneth the dead and calleth those thing which be not a though 
they were 

4 18 who against hope believ in hope that he might becom the 
father of mani nation accord to that which wa spoken so shall 
thi seed be 

4 19 and be not weak in faith he consid not hi own bodi now 
dead when he wa about an hundr year old neither yet the dead 
of sarah s womb 4 20 he stagger not at the promi of god through 
unbelief but wa strong in faith give glori to god 4 21 and be 
fulli persuad that what he had promi he wa abl also to 
perform 

4 22 and therefor it wa imput to him for righteou 

4 23 now it wa not written for hi sake alon that it wa imput to 
him 4 24 but for u also to whom it shall be imput if we believ 
on him that rai up jesu our lord from the dead 4 25 who wa 
deliv for our offenc and wa rai again for our 
justif 

5 1 therefor be justifi by faith we have peac with god through 
our lord jesu christ 5 2 by whom also we have access by faith into 
thi grace wherein we stand and rejoic in hope of the glori of god 

5 3 and not onli so but we glori in tribul also know that 
tribul worketh patienc 5 4 and patienc experi and 
experi hope 5 5 and hope maketh not asham becau the love of 
god is shed abroad in our heart by the holi ghost which is given unto 
u 

5 6 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ die for 
the ungodli 

5 7 for scarc for a righteou man will one die yet peradventur 
for a good man some would even dare to die 

5 8 but god commendeth hi love toward u in that while we were yet 
sinner christ die for u 

5 9 much more then be now justifi by hi blood we shall be 
save from wrath through him 

5 10 for if when we were enemi we were reconcil to god by the 
death of hi son much more be reconcil we shall be save by 
hi life 

5 11 and not onli so but we also joy in god through our lord jesu 
christ by whom we have now receiv the aton 

5 12 wherefor a by one man sin enter into the world and death by 
sin and so death pa upon all men for that all have sin 5 13 
for until the law sin wa in the world but sin is not imput when 
there is no law 

5 14 nevertheless death reign from adam to mose even over them 
that had not sin after the similitud of adam s transgress who 
is the figur of him that wa to come 

5 15 but not a the offenc so also is the free gift for if through 
the offenc of one mani be dead much more the grace of god and the 
gift by grace which is by one man jesu christ hath abound unto 
mani 

5 16 and not a it wa by one that sin so is the gift for the 
judgment wa by one to condemn but the free gift is of mani 
offenc unto justif 

5 17 for if by one man s offenc death reign by one much more they 
which receiv abund of grace and of the gift of righteou 
shall reign in life by one jesu christ 5 18 therefor a by the 
offenc of one judgment came upon all men to condemn even so by 
the righteou of one the free gift came upon all men unto 
justif of life 

5 19 for a by one man s disobedi mani were made sinner so by 
the obedi of one shall mani be made righteou 

5 20 moreov the law enter that the offenc might abound but 
where sin abound grace did much more abound 5 21 that a sin hath 
reign unto death even so might grace reign through righteou 
unto etern life by jesu christ our lord 

6 1 what shall we say then shall we continu in sin that grace may 
abound 6 2 god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live ani 
longer therein 6 3 know ye not that so mani of u a were baptiz 
into jesu christ were baptiz into hi death 6 4 therefor we are 
buri with him by baptism into death that like a christ wa rai 
up from the dead by the glori of the father even so we also should 
walk in new of life 

6 5 for if we have been plant togeth in the like of hi death 
we shall be also in the like of hi resurrect 6 6 know 
thi that our old man is crucifi with him that the bodi of sin 
might be destroy that henceforth we should not serv sin 

6 7 for he that is dead is freed from sin 

6 8 now if we be dead with christ we believ that we shall also live 
with him 6 9 know that christ be rai from the dead dieth no 
more death hath no more dominion over him 

6 10 for in that he die he die unto sin onc but in that he 
liveth he liveth unto god 

6 11 likewi reckon ye also yourselv to be dead ind unto sin 
but aliv unto god through jesu christ our lord 

6 12 let not sin therefor reign in your mortal bodi that ye should 
obey it in the lust thereof 

6 13 neither yield ye your member a instrument of unright 
unto sin but yield yourselv unto god a those that are aliv from 
the dead and your member a instrument of righteou unto god 

6 14 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under 
the law but under grace 

6 15 what then shall we sin becau we are not under the law but 
under grace god forbid 

6 16 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselv servant to obey 
hi servant ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of 
obedi unto righteou 6 17 but god be thank that ye were 
the servant of sin but ye have obey from the heart that form of 
doctrin which wa deliv you 

6 18 be then made free from sin ye becam the servant of 
righteou 

6 19 i speak after the manner of men becau of the infirm of your 
flesh for a ye have yield your member servant to unclean and 
to iniqu unto iniqu even so now yield your member servant to 
righteou unto holi 

6 20 for when ye were the servant of sin ye were free from 
righteou 

6 21 what fruit had ye then in those thing whereof ye are now 
asham for the end of those thing is death 

6 22 but now be made free from sin and becom servant to god ye 
have your fruit unto holi and the end everlast life 

6 23 for the wage of sin is death but the gift of god is etern 
life through jesu christ our lord 

7 1 know ye not brother for i speak to them that know the law 
how that the law hath dominion over a man a long a he liveth 7 2 
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband 
so long a he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loo from 
the law of her husband 

7 3 so then if while her husband liveth she be marri to anoth 
man she shall be call an adulteress but if her husband be dead 
she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be 
marri to anoth man 

7 4 wherefor my brother ye also are becom dead to the law by the 
bodi of christ that ye should be marri to anoth even to him who 
is rai from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god 

7 5 for when we were in the flesh the motion of sin which were by 
the law did work in our member to bring forth fruit unto death 

7 6 but now we are deliv from the law that be dead wherein we 
were held that we should serv in new of spirit and not in the 
old of the letter 

7 7 what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not 
known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law 
had said thou shalt not covet 

7 8 but sin take occa by the command wrought in me all 
manner of concupisc for without the law sin wa dead 

7 9 for i wa aliv without the law onc but when the command 
came sin reviv and i die 

7 10 and the command which wa ordain to life i found to be 
unto death 

7 11 for sin take occa by the command deceiv me and by 
it slew me 

7 12 wherefor the law is holi and the command holi and just 
and good 

7 13 wa then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but 
sin that it might appear sin work death in me by that which is 
good that sin by the command might becom exceed sin 

7 14 for we know that the law is spiritu but i am carnal sold 
under sin 

7 15 for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not 
but what i hate that do i 

7 16 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that 
it is good 

7 17 now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me 

7 18 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good 
thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which 
is good i find not 

7 19 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would 
not that i do 

7 20 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin 
that dwelleth in me 

7 21 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present 
with me 

7 22 for i delight in the law of god after the inward man 7 23 but i 
see anoth law in my member war against the law of my mind and 
bring me into captiv to the law of sin which is in my member 

7 24 o wretch man that i am who shall deliv me from the bodi of 
thi death 7 25 i thank god through jesu christ our lord so then 
with the mind i myself serv the law of god but with the flesh the 
law of sin 

8 1 there is therefor now no condemn to them which are in christ 
jesu who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 

8 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesu hath made me 
free from the law of sin and death 

8 3 for what the law could not do in that it wa weak through the 
flesh god send hi own son in the like of sin flesh and 
for sin condemn sin in the flesh 8 4 that the righteou of the 
law might be fulfil in u who walk not after the flesh but after 
the spirit 

8 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the thing of the flesh 
but they that are after the spirit the thing of the spirit 

8 6 for to be carnal mind is death but to be spiritu mind 
is life and peac 

8 7 becau the carnal mind is enmiti against god for it is not 
subject to the law of god neither ind can be 

8 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot plea god 

8 9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the 
spirit of god dwell in you now if ani man have not the spirit of 
christ he is none of hi 

8 10 and if christ be in you the bodi is dead becau of sin but the 
spirit is life becau of righteou 

8 11 but if the spirit of him that rai up jesu from the dead dwell 
in you he that rai up christ from the dead shall also quicken your 
mortal bodi by hi spirit that dwelleth in you 

8 12 therefor brother we are debtor not to the flesh to live 
after the flesh 

8 13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through 
the spirit do mortifi the deed of the bodi ye shall live 

8 14 for a mani a are led by the spirit of god they are the son of 
god 

8 15 for ye have not receiv the spirit of bondag again to fear but 
ye have receiv the spirit of adopt wherebi we cri abba father 

8 16 the spirit itself beareth wit with our spirit that we are 
the child of god 8 17 and if child then heir heir of god 
and joint heir with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we 
may be also glorifi togeth 

8 18 for i reckon that the suffer of thi present time are not 
worthi to be compar with the glori which shall be reveal in u 

8 19 for the earnest expect of the creatur waiteth for the 
manifest of the son of god 

8 20 for the creatur wa made subject to vaniti not willingli but 
by reason of him who hath subject the same in hope 8 21 becau the 
creatur itself also shall be deliv from the bondag of corrupt 
into the gloriou liberti of the child of god 

8 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
pain togeth until now 

8 23 and not onli they but ourselv also which have the firstfruit 
of the spirit even we ourselv groan within ourselv wait for 
the adopt to wit the redempt of our bodi 

8 24 for we are save by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for 
what a man seeth whi doth he yet hope for 8 25 but if we hope for 
that we see not then do we with patienc wait for it 

8 26 likewi the spirit also helpeth our infirm for we know not 
what we should pray for a we ought but the spirit itself maketh 
intercess for u with groan which cannot be utter 

8 27 and he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the 
spirit becau he maketh intercess for the saint accord to the 
will of god 

8 28 and we know that all thing work togeth for good to them that 
love god to them who are the call accord to hi purpo 

8 29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestin to be 
conform to the imag of hi son that he might be the firstborn 
among mani brother 

8 30 moreov whom he did predestin them he also call and whom 
he call them he also justifi and whom he justifi them he also 
glorifi 

8 31 what shall we then say to these thing if god be for u who can 
be against u 8 32 he that spare not hi own son but deliv him 
up for u all how shall he not with him also freeli give u all 
thing 8 33 who shall lay ani thing to the charg of god s elect it 
is god that justifieth 

8 34 who is he that condemneth it is christ that die yea rather 
that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also 
maketh intercess for u 

8 35 who shall separ u from the love of christ shall tribul 
or distress or persecut or famin or nake or peril or 
sword 8 36 a it is written for thi sake we are kill all the day 
long we are account a sheep for the slaughter 

8 37 nay in all these thing we are more than conqueror through him 
that love u 

8 38 for i am persuad that neither death nor life nor angel nor 
princip nor power nor thing present nor thing to come 
8 39 nor height nor depth nor ani other creatur shall be abl to 
separ u from the love of god which is in christ jesu our lord 

9 1 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscienc also bear 
me wit in the holi ghost 9 2 that i have great heavi and 
continu sorrow in my heart 

9 3 for i could wish that myself were accur from christ for my 
brother my kinsman accord to the flesh 9 4 who are israelit 
to whom pertaineth the adopt and the glori and the coven and 
the give of the law and the servic of god and the promi 9 5 
whose are the father and of whom a concern the flesh christ 
came who is over all god bless for ever amen 

9 6 not a though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are 
not all israel which are of israel 9 7 neither becau they are the 
seed of abraham are they all child but in isaac shall thi seed 
be call 

9 8 that is they which are the child of the flesh these are not 
the child of god but the child of the promi are count for 
the seed 

9 9 for thi is the word of promi at thi time will i come and 
sarah shall have a son 

9 10 and not onli thi but when rebecca also had conceiv by one 
even by our father isaac 9 11 for the child be not yet born 
neither have done ani good or evil that the purpo of god 
accord to elect might stand not of work but of him that 
calleth 9 12 it wa said unto her the elder shall serv the 
younger 

9 13 a it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hate 

9 14 what shall we say then is there unright with god god 
forbid 

9 15 for he saith to mose i will have merci on whom i will have 
merci and i will have compass on whom i will have compass 

9 16 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth 
but of god that sheweth merci 

9 17 for the scriptur saith unto pharaoh even for thi same purpo 
have i rai thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my 
name might be declar throughout all the earth 

9 18 therefor hath he merci on whom he will have merci and whom he 
will he hardeneth 

9 19 thou wilt say then unto me whi doth he yet find fault for who 
hath resist hi will 9 20 nay but o man who art thou that 
repliest against god shall the thing form say to him that form 
it whi hast thou made me thu 9 21 hath not the potter power over 
the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and anoth 
unto dishonour 9 22 what if god will to shew hi wrath and to 
make hi power known endur with much longsuff the vessel of 
wrath fit to destruct 9 23 and that he might make known the 
rich of hi glori on the vessel of merci which he had afor 
prepar unto glori 9 24 even u whom he hath call not of the 
jew onli but also of the gentil 9 25 a he saith also in ose i 
will call them my peopl which were not my peopl and her belov 
which wa not belov 

9 26 and it shall come to pa that in the place where it wa said 
unto them ye are not my peopl there shall they be call the 
child of the live god 

9 27 esaia also crieth concern israel though the number of the 
child of israel be a the sand of the sea a remnant shall be 
save 9 28 for he will finish the work and cut it short in 
righteou becau a short work will the lord make upon the earth 

9 29 and a esaia said befor except the lord of sabaoth had left u 
a seed we had been a sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha 

9 30 what shall we say then that the gentil which follow not 
after righteou have attain to righteou even the 
righteou which is of faith 

9 31 but israel which follow after the law of righteou hath 
not attain to the law of righteou 

9 32 wherefor becau they sought it not by faith but a it were by 
the work of the law for they stumbl at that stumblingston 9 33 
a it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingston and rock of 
offenc and whosoev believeth on him shall not be asham 

10 1 brother my heart s desir and prayer to god for israel is that 
they might be save 

10 2 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not 
accord to knowledg 

10 3 for they be ignor of god s righteou and go about 
to establish their own righteou have not submit themselv 
unto the righteou of god 

10 4 for christ is the end of the law for righteou to everi one 
that believeth 

10 5 for mose describeth the righteou which is of the law that 
the man which doeth those thing shall live by them 

10 6 but the righteou which is of faith speaketh on thi wise 
say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to 
bring christ down from abov 10 7 or who shall descend into the 
deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead 10 8 but 
what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thi mouth and in thi 
heart that is the word of faith which we preach 10 9 that if thou 
shalt confess with thi mouth the lord jesu and shalt believ in 
thine heart that god hath rai him from the dead thou shalt be 
save 

10 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteou and with 
the mouth confess is made unto salvat 

10 11 for the scriptur saith whosoev believeth on him shall not be 
asham 

10 12 for there is no differ between the jew and the greek for 
the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him 

10 13 for whosoev shall call upon the name of the lord shall be 
save 

10 14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believ 
and how shall they believ in him of whom they have not heard and how 
shall they hear without a preacher 10 15 and how shall they preach 
except they be sent a it is written how beauti are the foot of 
them that preach the gospel of peac and bring glad tide of good 
thing 10 16 but they have not all obey the gospel for esaia 
saith lord who hath believ our report 10 17 so then faith cometh 
by hear and hear by the word of god 

10 18 but i say have they not heard ye verili their sound went 
into all the earth and their word unto the end of the world 

10 19 but i say did not israel know first mose saith i will 
provok you to jealousi by them that are no peopl and by a foolish 
nation i will anger you 

10 20 but esaia is veri bold and saith i wa found of them that 
sought me not i wa made manifest unto them that ask not after me 

10 21 but to israel he saith all day long i have stretch forth my 
hand unto a disobedi and gainsay peopl 

11 1 i say then hath god cast away hi peopl god forbid for i also 
am an israelit of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin 

11 2 god hath not cast away hi peopl which he foreknew wot ye not 
what the scriptur saith of elia how he maketh intercess to god 
against israel say 11 3 lord they have kill thi prophet and 
dig down thine altar and i am left alon and they seek my life 

11 4 but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserv to 
myself seven thousand men who have not bow the knee to the imag of 
baal 

11 5 even so then at thi present time also there is a remnant 
accord to the elect of grace 

11 6 and if by grace then is it no more of work otherwi grace is 
no more grace but if it be of work then it is no more grace 
otherwi work is no more work 

11 7 what then israel hath not obtain that which he seeketh for 
but the elect hath obtain it and the rest were blind 

11 8 accord a it is written god hath given them the spirit of 
slumber eye that they should not see and ear that they should not 
hear unto thi day 

11 9 and david saith let their tabl be made a snare and a trap and 
a stumblingblock and a recomp unto them 11 10 let their eye be 
darken that they may not see and bow down their back alway 

11 11 i say then have they stumbl that they should fall god 
forbid but rather through their fall salvat is come unto the 
gentil for to provok them to jealousi 

11 12 now if the fall of them be the rich of the world and the 
diminish of them the rich of the gentil how much more their 
ful 11 13 for i speak to you gentil inasmuch a i am the 
apostl of the gentil i magnifi mine offic 11 14 if by ani mean 
i may provok to emul them which are my flesh and might save 
some of them 

11 15 for if the cast away of them be the reconcil of the world 
what shall the receiv of them be but life from the dead 11 16 
for if the firstfruit be holi the lump is also holi and if the root 
be holi so are the branch 

11 17 and if some of the branch be broken off and thou be a 
wild oliv tree wert graf in among them and with them partakest 
of the root and fat of the oliv tree 11 18 boast not against the 
branch but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root 
thee 

11 19 thou wilt say then the branch were broken off that i might 
be graf in 

11 20 well becau of unbelief they were broken off and thou 
standest by faith be not highmind but fear 11 21 for if god 
spare not the natur branch take heed lest he also spare not 
thee 

11 22 behold therefor the good and sever of god on them which 
fell sever but toward thee good if thou continu in hi 
good otherwi thou also shalt be cut off 

11 23 and they also if they abid not still in unbelief shall be 
graf in for god is abl to graff them in again 

11 24 for if thou wert cut out of the oliv tree which is wild by 
natur and wert graf contrari to natur into a good oliv tree 
how much more shall these which be the natur branch be graf 
into their own oliv tree 11 25 for i would not brother that ye 
should be ignor of thi mysteri lest ye should be wise in your own 
conceit that blind in part is happen to israel until the 
ful of the gentil be come in 

11 26 and so all israel shall be save a it is written there shall 
come out of sion the deliv and shall turn away ungodli from 
jacob 11 27 for thi is my coven unto them when i shall take away 
their sin 

11 28 a concern the gospel they are enemi for your sake but 
a touch the elect they are belov for the father s sake 

11 29 for the gift and call of god are without repent 

11 30 for a ye in time past have not believ god yet have now 
obtain merci through their unbelief 11 31 even so have these also 
now not believ that through your merci they also may obtain merci 

11 32 for god hath conclud them all in unbelief that he might have 
merci upon all 

11 33 o the depth of the rich both of the wisdom and knowledg of 
god how unsearch are hi judgment and hi way past find 
out 11 34 for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been 
hi counsellor 11 35 or who hath first given to him and it shall be 
recompen unto him again 11 36 for of him and through him and to 
him are all thing to whom be glori for ever amen 

12 1 i beseech you therefor brother by the merci of god that ye 
present your bodi a live sacrif holi accept unto god 
which is your reason servic 

12 2 and be not conform to thi world but be ye transform by the 
renew of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and 
accept and perfect will of god 

12 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to everi man that is 
among you not to think of himself more highli than he ought to think 
but to think soberli accord a god hath dealt to everi man the 
measur of faith 

12 4 for a we have mani member in one bodi and all member have not 
the same offic 12 5 so we be mani are one bodi in christ and 
everi one member one of anoth 

12 6 have then gift differ accord to the grace that is given 
to u whether propheci let u prophesi accord to the proport 
of faith 12 7 or ministri let u wait on our minist or he that 
teacheth on teach 12 8 or he that exhorteth on exhort he 
that giveth let him do it with simplic he that ruleth with 
dilig he that sheweth merci with cheer 

12 9 let love be without dissimul abhor that which is evil 
cleav to that which is good 

12 10 be kindli affect one to anoth with brotherli love in 
honour prefer one anoth 12 11 not sloth in busi fervent 
in spirit serv the lord 12 12 rejoic in hope patient in 
tribul continu instant in prayer 12 13 distribut to the 
necess of saint given to hospit 

12 14 bless them which persecut you bless and cur not 

12 15 rejoic with them that do rejoic and weep with them that weep 

12 16 be of the same mind one toward anoth mind not high thing 
but condescend to men of low estat be not wise in your own conceit 

12 17 recompen to no man evil for evil provid thing honest in the 
sight of all men 

12 18 if it be possibl a much a lieth in you live peaceabl with 
all men 

12 19 dearli belov aveng not yourselv but rather give place 
unto wrath for it is written vengeanc is mine i will repay saith 
the lord 

12 20 therefor if thine enemi hunger feed him if he thirst give 
him drink for in so do thou shalt heap coal of fire on hi head 

12 21 be not overcom of evil but overcom evil with good 

13 1 let everi soul be subject unto the higher power for there is no 
power but of god the power that be are ordain of god 

13 2 whosoev therefor resisteth the power resisteth the ordin 
of god and they that resist shall receiv to themselv damnat 

13 3 for ruler are not a terror to good work but to the evil wilt 
thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou 
shalt have prai of the same 13 4 for he is the minist of god to 
thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he 
beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minist of god a 
reveng to execut wrath upon him that doeth evil 

13 5 wherefor ye must need be subject not onli for wrath but also 
for conscienc sake 

13 6 for for thi cau pay ye tribut also for they are god s 
minist attend continu upon thi veri thing 

13 7 render therefor to all their due tribut to whom tribut is 
due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour 

13 8 owe no man ani thing but to love one anoth for he that loveth 
anoth hath fulfil the law 

13 9 for thi thou shalt not commit adulteri thou shalt not kill 
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear fal wit thou shalt 
not covet and if there be ani other command it is briefli 
comprehend in thi say name thou shalt love thi neighbour a 
thyself 

13 10 love worketh no ill to hi neighbour therefor love is the 
fulfil of the law 

13 11 and that know the time that now it is high time to awak 
out of sleep for now is our salvat nearer than when we believ 

13 12 the night is far spent the day is at hand let u therefor 
cast off the work of dark and let u put on the armour of light 

13 13 let u walk honestli a in the day not in riot and 
drunken not in chamber and wanton not in strife and 
envi 

13 14 but put ye on the lord jesu christ and make not provi for 
the flesh to fulfil the lust thereof 

14 1 him that is weak in the faith receiv ye but not to doubt 
disput 

14 2 for one believeth that he may eat all thing anoth who is 
weak eateth herb 

14 3 let not him that eateth despi him that eateth not and let not 
him which eateth not judg him that eateth for god hath receiv him 

14 4 who art thou that judgest anoth man s servant to hi own 
master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is 
abl to make him stand 

14 5 one man esteemeth one day abov anoth anoth esteemeth everi 
day alik let everi man be fulli persuad in hi own mind 

14 6 he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he 
that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that 
eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thank and he that 
eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thank 

14 7 for none of u liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself 

14 8 for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die 
we die unto the lord whether we live therefor or die we are the 
lord s 

14 9 for to thi end christ both die and rose and reviv that he 
might be lord both of the dead and live 

14 10 but whi dost thou judg thi brother or whi dost thou set at 
nought thi brother for we shall all stand befor the judgment seat of 
christ 

14 11 for it is written a i live saith the lord everi knee shall 
bow to me and everi tongu shall confess to god 

14 12 so then everi one of u shall give account of himself to god 

14 13 let u not therefor judg one anoth ani more but judg thi 
rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occa to fall in hi 
brother s way 

14 14 i know and am persuad by the lord jesu that there is 
noth unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth ani thing to be 
unclean to him it is unclean 

14 15 but if thi brother be griev with thi meat now walkest thou 
not charit destroy not him with thi meat for whom christ die 

14 16 let not then your good be evil spoken of 14 17 for the kingdom 
of god is not meat and drink but righteou and peac and joy in 
the holi ghost 

14 18 for he that in these thing serveth christ is accept to god 
and approv of men 

14 19 let u therefor follow after the thing which make for peac 
and thing wherewith one may edifi anoth 

14 20 for meat destroy not the work of god all thing ind are 
pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offenc 

14 21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor ani 
thing wherebi thi brother stumbleth or is offend or is made weak 

14 22 hast thou faith have it to thyself befor god happi is he that 
condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth 

14 23 and he that doubteth is damn if he eat becau he eateth not 
of faith for whatsoev is not of faith is sin 

15 1 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirm of the 
weak and not to plea ourselv 

15 2 let everi one of u plea hi neighbour for hi good to 
edif 

15 3 for even christ plea not himself but a it is written the 
reproach of them that reproach thee fell on me 

15 4 for whatsoev thing were written aforetim were written for our 
learn that we through patienc and comfort of the scriptur might 
have hope 

15 5 now the god of patienc and consol grant you to be 
likemind one toward anoth accord to christ jesu 15 6 that ye 
may with one mind and one mouth glorifi god even the father of our 
lord jesu christ 

15 7 wherefor receiv ye one anoth a christ also receiv u to 
the glori of god 

15 8 now i say that jesu christ wa a minist of the circumci 
for the truth of god to confirm the promi made unto the father 
15 9 and that the gentil might glorifi god for hi merci a it is 
written for thi cau i will confess to thee among the gentil and 
sing unto thi name 

15 10 and again he saith rejoic ye gentil with hi peopl 

15 11 and again prai the lord all ye gentil and laud him all 
ye peopl 

15 12 and again esaia saith there shall be a root of jess and he 
that shall rise to reign over the gentil in him shall the gentil 
trust 

15 13 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peac in 
believ that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holi 
ghost 

15 14 and i myself also am persuad of you my brother that ye also 
are full of good fill with all knowledg abl also to admonish 
one anoth 

15 15 nevertheless brother i have written the more boldli unto you 
in some sort a put you in mind becau of the grace that is 
given to me of god 15 16 that i should be the minist of jesu 
christ to the gentil minist the gospel of god that the 
offer up of the gentil might be accept be sanctifi by 
the holi ghost 

15 17 i have therefor whereof i may glori through jesu christ in 
those thing which pertain to god 

15 18 for i will not dare to speak of ani of those thing which christ 
hath not wrought by me to make the gentil obedi by word and 
deed 15 19 through mighti sign and wonder by the power of the 
spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum 
i have fulli preach the gospel of christ 

15 20 yea so have i strive to preach the gospel not where christ 
wa name lest i should build upon anoth man s foundat 15 21 
but a it is written to whom he wa not spoken of they shall see 
and they that have not heard shall understand 

15 22 for which cau also i have been much hinder from come to

journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my 
journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be 
somewhat fill with your compani 

15 25 but now i go unto jerusalem to minist unto the saint 

15 26 for it hath plea them of macedonia and achaia to make a 
certain contribut for the poor saint which are at jerusalem 

15 27 it hath plea them verili and their debtor they are for if 
the gentil have been made partak of their spiritu thing their 
duti is also to minist unto them in carnal thing 

15 28 when therefor i have perform thi and have seal to them 
thi fruit i will come by you into spain

your prayer to god for me 15 31 that i may be deliv from them 
that do not believ in judaea and that my servic which i have for 
jerusalem may be accept of the saint 15 32 that i may come unto 
you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refresh

the first epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian 


1 1 paul call to be an apostl of jesu christ through the will of 
god and sosthen our brother 1 2 unto the church of god which is at 
corinth to them that are sanctifi in christ jesu call to be 
saint with all that in everi place call upon the name of jesu 
christ our lord both their s and our s 1 3 grace be unto you and 
peac from god our father and from the lord jesu christ 

1 4 i thank my god alway on your behalf for the grace of god which 
is given you by jesu christ 1 5 that in everi thing ye are enrich 
by him in all utter and in all knowledg 1 6 even a the 
testimoni of christ wa confirm in you 1 7 so that ye come behind 
in no gift wait for the come of our lord jesu christ 1 8 who 
shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the 
day of our lord jesu christ 

1 9 god is faith by whom ye were call unto the fellowship of hi 
son jesu christ our lord 

1 10 now i beseech you brother by the name of our lord jesu 
christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no 
divi among you but that ye be perfectli join togeth in the 
same mind and in the same judgment 

1 11 for it hath been declar unto me of you my brother by them 
which are of the hou of chloe that there are content among you 

1 12 now thi i say that everi one of you saith i am of paul and i 
of apollo and i of cepha and i of christ 

1 13 is christ divid wa paul crucifi for you or were ye 
baptiz in the name of paul 1 14 i thank god that i baptiz none 
of you but crispu and gaiu 1 15 lest ani should say that i had 
baptiz in mine own name 

1 16 and i baptiz also the household of stephana besid i know 
not whether i baptiz ani other 

1 17 for christ sent me not to baptiz but to preach the gospel not 
with wisdom of word lest the cross of christ should be made of none 
effect 

1 18 for the preach of the cross is to them that perish 
foolish but unto u which are save it is the power of god 

1 19 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and 
will bring to noth the understand of the prudent 

1 20 where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disput of 
thi world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of thi world 1 21 
for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god 
it plea god by the foolish of preach to save them that 
believ 

1 22 for the jew requir a sign and the greek seek after wisdom 
1 23 but we preach christ crucifi unto the jew a stumblingblock 
and unto the greek foolish 1 24 but unto them which are call 
both jew and greek christ the power of god and the wisdom of god 

1 25 becau the foolish of god is wiser than men and the 
weak of god is stronger than men 

1 26 for ye see your call brother how that not mani wise men 
after the flesh not mani mighti not mani nobl are call 1 27 but 
god hath chosen the foolish thing of the world to confound the wise 
and god hath chosen the weak thing of the world to confound the 
thing which are mighti 1 28 and base thing of the world and thing 
which are despi hath god chosen yea and thing which are not to 
bring to nought thing that are 1 29 that no flesh should glori in 
hi presenc 

1 30 but of him are ye in christ jesu who of god is made unto u 
wisdom and righteou and sanctif and redempt 1 31 
that accord a it is written he that glorieth let him glori in 
the lord 

2 1 and i brother when i came to you came not with excel of 
speech or of wisdom declar unto you the testimoni of god 

2 2 for i determin not to know ani thing among you save jesu 
christ and him crucifi 

2 3 and i wa with you in weak and in fear and in much 
trembl 

2 4 and my speech and my preach wa not with entic word of 
man s wisdom but in demonstr of the spirit and of power 2 5 
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the 
power of god 

2 6 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the 
wisdom of thi world nor of the princ of thi world that come to 
nought 2 7 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mysteri even the 
hidden wisdom which god ordain befor the world unto our glori 2 8 
which none of the princ of thi world knew for had they known it 
they would not have crucifi the lord of glori 

2 9 but a it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither 
have enter into the heart of man the thing which god hath prepar 
for them that love him 

2 10 but god hath reveal them unto u by hi spirit for the spirit 
searcheth all thing yea the deep thing of god 

2 11 for what man knoweth the thing of a man save the spirit of man 
which is in him even so the thing of god knoweth no man but the 
spirit of god 

2 12 now we have receiv not the spirit of the world but the spirit 
which is of god that we might know the thing that are freeli given 
to u of god 

2 13 which thing also we speak not in the word which man s wisdom 
teacheth but which the holi ghost teacheth compar spiritu 
thing with spiritu 

2 14 but the natur man receiveth not the thing of the spirit of 
god for they are foolish unto him neither can he know them 
becau they are spiritu discern 

2 15 but he that is spiritu judgeth all thing yet he himself is 
judg of no man 

2 16 for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct 
him but we have the mind of christ 

3 1 and i brother could not speak unto you a unto spiritu but 
a unto carnal even a unto babe in christ 

3 2 i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were 
not abl to bear it neither yet now are ye abl 

3 3 for ye are yet carnal for wherea there is among you envi and 
strife and divi are ye not carnal and walk a men 3 4 for 
while one saith i am of paul and anoth i am of apollo are ye 
not carnal 3 5 who then is paul and who is apollo but minist 
by whom ye believ even a the lord gave to everi man 3 6 i have 
plant apollo water but god gave the increa 

3 7 so then neither is he that planteth ani thing neither he that 
watereth but god that giveth the increa 

3 8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and everi man 
shall receiv hi own reward accord to hi own labour 

3 9 for we are labour togeth with god ye are god s husbandri ye 
are god s build 

3 10 accord to the grace of god which is given unto me a a wise 
masterbuild i have laid the foundat and anoth buildeth 
thereon but let everi man take heed how he buildeth thereupon 

3 11 for other foundat can no man lay than that is laid which is 
jesu christ 

3 12 now if ani man build upon thi foundat gold silver preciou 
stone wood hay stubbl 3 13 everi man s work shall be made 
manifest for the day shall declar it becau it shall be reveal 
by fire and the fire shall tri everi man s work of what sort it is 

3 14 if ani man s work abid which he hath built thereupon he shall 
receiv a reward 

3 15 if ani man s work shall be burn he shall suffer loss but he 
himself shall be save yet so a by fire 

3 16 know ye not that ye are the templ of god and that the spirit of 
god dwelleth in you 3 17 if ani man defil the templ of god him 
shall god destroy for the templ of god is holi which templ ye are 

3 18 let no man deceiv himself if ani man among you seemeth to be 
wise in thi world let him becom a fool that he may be wise 

3 19 for the wisdom of thi world is foolish with god for it is 
written he taketh the wise in their own crafti 

3 20 and again the lord knoweth the thought of the wise that they 
are vain 

3 21 therefor let no man glori in men for all thing are your s 
3 22 whether paul or apollo or cepha or the world or life or 
death or thing present or thing to come all are your s 3 23 and 
ye are christ s and christ is god s 

4 1 let a man so account of u a of the minist of christ and 
steward of the mysteri of god 

4 2 moreov it is requir in steward that a man be found faith 

4 3 but with me it is a veri small thing that i should be judg of 
you or of man s judgment yea i judg not mine own self 

4 4 for i know noth by myself yet am i not herebi justifi but 
he that judgeth me is the lord 

4 5 therefor judg noth befor the time until the lord come who 
both will bring to light the hidden thing of dark and will make 
manifest the counsel of the heart and then shall everi man have 
prai of god 

4 6 and these thing brother i have in a figur transfer to 
myself and to apollo for your sake that ye might learn in u not to 
think of men abov that which is written that no one of you be puf 
up for one against anoth 

4 7 for who maketh thee to differ from anoth and what hast thou 
that thou didst not receiv now if thou didst receiv it whi dost 
thou glori a if thou hadst not receiv it 4 8 now ye are full 
now ye are rich ye have reign a king without u and i would to 
god ye did reign that we also might reign with you 

4 9 for i think that god hath set forth u the apostl last a it 
were appoint to death for we are made a spectacl unto the world 
and to angel and to men 

4 10 we are fool for christ s sake but ye are wise in christ we are 
weak but ye are strong ye are honour but we are despi 

4 11 even unto thi present hour we both hunger and thirst and are 
nake and are buffet and have no certain dwellingplac 4 12 and 
labour work with our own hand be revil we bless be 
persecut we suffer it 4 13 be defam we intreat we are made 
a the filth of the world and are the offscour of all thing unto 
thi day 

4 14 i write not these thing to shame you but a my belov son i 
warn you 

4 15 for though ye have ten thousand instruct in christ yet have 
ye not mani father for in christ jesu i have begotten you through 
the gospel 

4 16 wherefor i beseech you be ye follow of me 

4 17 for thi cau have i sent unto you timotheu who is my belov 
son and faith in the lord who shall bring you into remembr of 
my way which be in christ a i teach everi where in everi church 

4 18 now some are puf up a though i would not come to you 

4 19 but i will come to you shortli if the lord will and will know 
not the speech of them which are puf up but the power 

4 20 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power 

4 21 what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and 
in the spirit of meek 5 1 it is report commonli that there is 
fornic among you and such fornic a is not so much a name 
among the gentil that one should have hi father s wife 

5 2 and ye are puf up and have not rather mourn that he that 
hath done thi deed might be taken away from among you 

5 3 for i verili a absent in bodi but present in spirit have 
judg alreadi a though i were present concern him that hath so 
done thi deed 5 4 in the name of our lord jesu christ when ye are 
gather togeth and my spirit with the power of our lord jesu 
christ 5 5 to deliv such an one unto satan for the destruct of 
the flesh that the spirit may be save in the day of the lord jesu 

5 6 your glori is not good know ye not that a littl leaven 
leaveneth the whole lump 5 7 purg out therefor the old leaven 
that ye may be a new lump a ye are unleaven for even christ our 
passov is sacrif for u 5 8 therefor let u keep the feast 
not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malic and wick 
but with the unleaven bread of sincer and truth 

5 9 i wrote unto you in an epistl not to compani with fornic 
5 10 yet not altogeth with the fornic of thi world or with 
the covet or extort or with idolat for then must ye 
need go out of the world 

5 11 but now i have written unto you not to keep compani if ani man 
that is call a brother be a fornic or covet or an idolat 
or a railer or a drunkard or an extort with such an one no not 
to eat 

5 12 for what have i to do to judg them also that are without do not 
ye judg them that are within 5 13 but them that are without god 
judgeth therefor put away from among yourselv that wick person 

6 1 dare ani of you have a matter against anoth go to law befor 
the unjust and not befor the saint 6 2 do ye not know that the 
saint shall judg the world and if the world shall be judg by you 
are ye unworthi to judg the smallest matter 6 3 know ye not that 
we shall judg angel how much more thing that pertain to thi life 
6 4 if then ye have judgment of thing pertain to thi life set 
them to judg who are least esteem in the church 

6 5 i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man 
among you no not one that shall be abl to judg between hi 
brother 6 6 but brother goeth to law with brother and that befor 
the unbeliev 

6 7 now therefor there is utterli a fault among you becau ye go to 
law one with anoth whi do ye not rather take wrong whi do ye not 
rather suffer yourselv to be defraud 6 8 nay ye do wrong and 
defraud and that your brother 

6 9 know ye not that the unright shall not inherit the kingdom of 
god be not deceiv neither fornic nor idolat nor 
adult nor effemin nor abu of themselv with mankind 
6 10 nor thief nor covet nor drunkard nor revil nor 
extort shall inherit the kingdom of god 

6 11 and such were some of you but ye are wash but ye are 
sanctifi but ye are justifi in the name of the lord jesu and by 
the spirit of our god 

6 12 all thing are law unto me but all thing are not expedi 
all thing are law for me but i will not be brought under the 
power of ani 

6 13 meat for the belli and the belli for meat but god shall 
destroy both it and them now the bodi is not for fornic but for 
the lord and the lord for the bodi 

6 14 and god hath both rai up the lord and will also rai up u 
by hi own power 

6 15 know ye not that your bodi are the member of christ shall i 
then take the member of christ and make them the member of an 
harlot god forbid 

6 16 what know ye not that he which is join to an harlot is one 
bodi for two saith he shall be one flesh 

6 17 but he that is join unto the lord is one spirit 

6 18 flee fornic everi sin that a man doeth is without the bodi 
but he that committeth fornic sinneth against hi own bodi 

6 19 what know ye not that your bodi is the templ of the holi ghost 
which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own 6 20 
for ye are bought with a price therefor glorifi god in your bodi 
and in your spirit which are god s 

7 1 now concern the thing whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for 
a man not to touch a woman 

7 2 nevertheless to avoid fornic let everi man have hi own 
wife and let everi woman have her own husband 

7 3 let the husband render unto the wife due benevol and likewi 
also the wife unto the husband 

7 4 the wife hath not power of her own bodi but the husband and 
likewi also the husband hath not power of hi own bodi but the 
wife 

7 5 defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a 
time that ye may give yourselv to fast and prayer and come 
togeth again that satan tempt you not for your incontin 

7 6 but i speak thi by permiss and not of command 

7 7 for i would that all men were even a i myself but everi man hath 
hi proper gift of god one after thi manner and anoth after that 

7 8 i say therefor to the unmarri and widow it is good for them 
if they abid even a i 

7 9 but if they cannot contain let them marri for it is better to 
marri than to burn 

7 10 and unto the marri i command yet not i but the lord let not 
the wife depart from her husband 7 11 but and if she depart let her 
remain unmarri or be reconcil to her husband and let not the 
husband put away hi wife 

7 12 but to the rest speak i not the lord if ani brother hath a wife 
that believeth not and she be plea to dwell with him let him not 
put her away 

7 13 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he 
be plea to dwell with her let her not leav him 

7 14 for the unbeliev husband is sanctifi by the wife and the 
unbeliev wife is sanctifi by the husband el were your child 
unclean but now are they holi 

7 15 but if the unbeliev depart let him depart a brother or a 
sister is not under bondag in such case but god hath call u to 
peac 

7 16 for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thi 
husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thi 
wife 7 17 but a god hath distribut to everi man a the lord hath 
call everi one so let him walk and so ordain i in all church 

7 18 is ani man call be circumci let him not becom 
uncircumci is ani call in uncircumci let him not be 
circumci 

7 19 circumci is noth and uncircumci is noth but the 
keep of the command of god 

7 20 let everi man abid in the same call wherein he wa call 

7 21 art thou call be a servant care not for it but if thou 
mayest be made free use it rather 

7 22 for he that is call in the lord be a servant is the lord s 
freeman likewi also he that is call be free is christ s 
servant 

7 23 ye are bought with a price be not ye the servant of men 

7 24 brother let everi man wherein he is call therein abid with 
god 

7 25 now concern virgin i have no command of the lord yet i 
give my judgment a one that hath obtain merci of the lord to be 
faith 

7 26 i suppo therefor that thi is good for the present distress i 
say that it is good for a man so to be 

7 27 art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loo art thou 
loo from a wife seek not a wife 

7 28 but and if thou marri thou hast not sin and if a virgin 
marri she hath not sin nevertheless such shall have troubl in 
the flesh but i spare you 

7 29 but thi i say brother the time is short it remaineth that 
both they that have wife be a though they had none 7 30 and they 
that weep a though they wept not and they that rejoic a though 
they rejoic not and they that buy a though they poss not 
7 31 and they that use thi world a not abu it for the fashion 
of thi world passeth away 

7 32 but i would have you without care he that is unmarri 
careth for the thing that belong to the lord how he may plea the 
lord 7 33 but he that is marri careth for the thing that are of 
the world how he may plea hi wife 

7 34 there is differ also between a wife and a virgin the 
unmarri woman careth for the thing of the lord that she may be 
holi both in bodi and in spirit but she that is marri careth for 
the thing of the world how she may plea her husband 

7 35 and thi i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare 
upon you but for that which is come and that ye may attend upon 
the lord without distract 

7 36 but if ani man think that he behaveth himself uncom toward hi 
virgin if she pa the flower of her age and need so requir let 
him do what he will he sinneth not let them marri 

7 37 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in hi heart have no 
necess but hath power over hi own will and hath so decr in 
hi heart that he will keep hi virgin doeth well 

7 38 so then he that giveth her in marriag doeth well but he that 
giveth her not in marriag doeth better 

7 39 the wife is bound by the law a long a her husband liveth but 
if her husband be dead she is at liberti to be marri to whom she 
will onli in the lord 

7 40 but she is happier if she so abid after my judgment and i 
think also that i have the spirit of god 

8 1 now a touch thing offer unto idol we know that we all 
have knowledg knowledg puffeth up but chariti edifieth 

8 2 and if ani man think that he knoweth ani thing he knoweth noth 
yet a he ought to know 

8 3 but if ani man love god the same is known of him 

8 4 a concern therefor the eat of those thing that are 
offer in sacrif unto idol we know that an idol is noth in 
the world and that there is none other god but one 

8 5 for though there be that are call god whether in heaven or in 
earth a there be god mani and lord mani 8 6 but to u there is 
but one god the father of whom are all thing and we in him and 
one lord jesu christ by whom are all thing and we by him 

8 7 howbeit there is not in everi man that knowledg for some with 
conscienc of the idol unto thi hour eat it a a thing offer unto 
an idol and their conscienc be weak is defil 

8 8 but meat commendeth u not to god for neither if we eat are we 
the better neither if we eat not are we the wor 

8 9 but take heed lest by ani mean thi liberti of your s becom a 
stumblingblock to them that are weak 

8 10 for if ani man see thee which hast knowledg sit at meat in the 
idol s templ shall not the conscienc of him which is weak be 
embolden to eat those thing which are offer to idol 8 11 and 
through thi knowledg shall the weak brother perish for whom christ 
die 8 12 but when ye sin so against the brother and wound their 
weak conscienc ye sin against christ 

8 13 wherefor if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh 
while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend 

9 1 am i not an apostl am i not free have i not seen jesu christ 
our lord are not ye my work in the lord 9 2 if i be not an apostl 
unto other yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine 
apostleship are ye in the lord 

9 3 mine answer to them that do examin me is thi 9 4 have we not 
power to eat and to drink 9 5 have we not power to lead about a 
sister a wife a well a other apostl and a the brother of the 
lord and cepha 9 6 or i onli and barnaba have not we power to 
forbear work 9 7 who goeth a warfar ani time at hi own charg 
who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who 
feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock 9 8 say i 
these thing a a man or saith not the law the same also 9 9 for it 
is written in the law of mose thou shalt not muzzl the mouth of the 
ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for ox 9 10 or 
saith he it altogeth for our sake for our sake no doubt thi is 
written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that 
thresheth in hope should be partak of hi hope 

9 11 if we have sown unto you spiritu thing is it a great thing if 
we shall reap your carnal thing 9 12 if other be partak of thi 
power over you are not we rather nevertheless we have not use thi 
power but suffer all thing lest we should hinder the gospel of 
christ 

9 13 do ye not know that they which minist about holi thing live of 
the thing of the templ and they which wait at the altar are 
partak with the altar 9 14 even so hath the lord ordain that 
they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel 

9 15 but i have use none of these thing neither have i written 
these thing that it should be so done unto me for it were better 
for me to die than that ani man should make my glori void 

9 16 for though i preach the gospel i have noth to glori of for 
necess is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the 
gospel 9 17 for if i do thi thing willingli i have a reward but 
if against my will a dispen of the gospel is commit unto me 

9 18 what is my reward then verili that when i preach the gospel i 
may make the gospel of christ without charg that i abu not my 
power in the gospel 

9 19 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant 
unto all that i might gain the more 

9 20 and unto the jew i becam a a jew that i might gain the jew 
to them that are under the law a under the law that i might gain 
them that are under the law 9 21 to them that are without law a 
without law be not without law to god but under the law to 
christ that i might gain them that are without law 

9 22 to the weak becam i a weak that i might gain the weak i am 
made all thing to all men that i might by all mean save some 

9 23 and thi i do for the gospel s sake that i might be partak 
thereof with you 

9 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one 
receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain 

9 25 and everi man that striveth for the masteri is temper in all 
thing now they do it to obtain a corrupt crown but we an 
incorrupt 

9 26 i therefor so run not a uncertainli so fight i not a one 
that beateth the air 9 27 but i keep under my bodi and bring it into 
subject lest that by ani mean when i have preach to other i 
myself should be a castaway 

10 1 moreov brother i would not that ye should be ignor how 
that all our father were under the cloud and all pa through the 
sea 10 2 and were all baptiz unto mose in the cloud and in the 
sea 10 3 and did all eat the same spiritu meat 10 4 and did all 
drink the same spiritu drink for they drank of that spiritu rock 
that follow them and that rock wa christ 

10 5 but with mani of them god wa not well plea for they were 
overthrown in the wilder 

10 6 now these thing were our exampl to the intent we should not 
lust after evil thing a they also lust 

10 7 neither be ye idolat a were some of them a it is written 
the peopl sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play 

10 8 neither let u commit fornic a some of them commit and 
fell in one day three and twenti thousand 

10 9 neither let u tempt christ a some of them also tempt and 
were destroy of serpent 

10 10 neither murmur ye a some of them also murmur and were 
destroy of the destroy 

10 11 now all these thing happen unto them for ensampl and they 
are written for our admonit upon whom the end of the world are 
come 

10 12 wherefor let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he 
fall 

10 13 there hath no temptat taken you but such a is common to man 
but god is faith who will not suffer you to be tempt abov that 
ye are abl but will with the temptat also make a way to escap 
that ye may be abl to bear it 

10 14 wherefor my dearli belov flee from idolatri 

10 15 i speak a to wise men judg ye what i say 

10 16 the cup of bless which we bless is it not the communion of 
the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion 
of the bodi of christ 10 17 for we be mani are one bread and one 
bodi for we are all partak of that one bread 

10 18 behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the 
sacrif partak of the altar 10 19 what say i then that the 
idol is ani thing or that which is offer in sacrif to idol is 
ani thing 10 20 but i say that the thing which the gentil 
sacrif they sacrif to devil and not to god and i would not 
that ye should have fellowship with devil 

10 21 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devil ye 
cannot be partak of the lord s tabl and of the tabl of devil 

10 22 do we provok the lord to jealousi are we stronger than he 
10 23 all thing are law for me but all thing are not expedi 
all thing are law for me but all thing edifi not 

10 24 let no man seek hi own but everi man anoth s wealth 

10 25 whatsoev is sold in the shambl that eat ask no question 
for conscienc sake 10 26 for the earth is the lord s and the 
ful thereof 

10 27 if ani of them that believ not bid you to a feast and ye be 
dispo to go whatsoev is set befor you eat ask no question 
for conscienc sake 

10 28 but if ani man say unto you thi is offer in sacrif unto 
idol eat not for hi sake that shew it and for conscienc sake 
for the earth is the lord s and the ful thereof 10 29 
conscienc i say not thine own but of the other for whi is my 
liberti judg of anoth man s conscienc 10 30 for if i by grace 
be a partak whi am i evil spoken of for that for which i give 
thank 10 31 whether therefor ye eat or drink or whatsoev ye 
do do all to the glori of god 

10 32 give none offenc neither to the jew nor to the gentil nor 
to the church of god 10 33 even a i plea all men in all thing 
not seek mine own profit but the profit of mani that they may be 
save 

11 1 be ye follow of me even a i also am of christ 

11 2 now i prai you brother that ye rememb me in all thing 
and keep the ordin a i deliv them to you 

11 3 but i would have you know that the head of everi man is christ 
and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god 

11 4 everi man pray or prophesi have hi head cover 
dishonoureth hi head 

11 5 but everi woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head 
uncov dishonoureth her head for that is even all one a if she 
were shaven 

11 6 for if the woman be not cover let her also be shorn but if it 
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be cover 

11 7 for a man ind ought not to cover hi head forasmuch a he is 
the imag and glori of god but the woman is the glori of the man 

11 8 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man 

11 9 neither wa the man creat for the woman but the woman for the 
man 

11 10 for thi cau ought the woman to have power on her head becau 
of the angel 

11 11 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the 
woman without the man in the lord 

11 12 for a the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the 
woman but all thing of god 

11 13 judg in yourselv is it come that a woman pray unto god 
uncov 11 14 doth not even natur itself teach you that if a 
man have long hair it is a shame unto him 11 15 but if a woman have 
long hair it is a glori to her for her hair is given her for a 
cover 

11 16 but if ani man seem to be contenti we have no such custom 
neither the church of god 

11 17 now in thi that i declar unto you i prai you not that ye 
come togeth not for the better but for the wor 

11 18 for first of all when ye come togeth in the church i hear 
that there be divi among you and i partli believ it 

11 19 for there must be also heresi among you that they which are 
approv may be made manifest among you 

11 20 when ye come togeth therefor into one place thi is not to 
eat the lord s supper 

11 21 for in eat everi one taketh befor other hi own supper and 
one is hungri and anoth is drunken 

11 22 what have ye not hou to eat and to drink in or despi ye 
the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to 
you shall i prai you in thi i prai you not 

11 23 for i have receiv of the lord that which also i deliv unto 
you that the lord jesu the same night in which he wa betray took 
bread 11 24 and when he had given thank he brake it and said 
take eat thi is my bodi which is broken for you thi do in 
remembr of me 

11 25 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup 
say thi cup is the new testament in my blood thi do ye a oft 
a ye drink it in remembr of me 

11 26 for a often a ye eat thi bread and drink thi cup ye do 
shew the lord s death till he come 

11 27 wherefor whosoev shall eat thi bread and drink thi cup of 
the lord unworthili shall be guilti of the bodi and blood of the 
lord 

11 28 but let a man examin himself and so let him eat of that bread 
and drink of that cup 

11 29 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthili eateth and drinketh 
damnat to himself not discern the lord s bodi 

11 30 for thi cau mani are weak and sickli among you and mani 
sleep 

11 31 for if we would judg ourselv we should not be judg 

11 32 but when we are judg we are chasten of the lord that we 
should not be condemn with the world 

11 33 wherefor my brother when ye come togeth to eat tarri one 
for anoth 

11 34 and if ani man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not 
togeth unto condemn and the rest will i set in order when i 
come 

12 1 now concern spiritu gift brother i would not have you 
ignor 

12 2 ye know that ye were gentil carri away unto these dumb 
idol even a ye were led 

12 3 wherefor i give you to understand that no man speak by the 
spirit of god calleth jesu accur and that no man can say that 
jesu is the lord but by the holi ghost 

12 4 now there are diver of gift but the same spirit 

12 5 and there are differ of administr but the same lord 

12 6 and there are diver of oper but it is the same god 
which worketh all in all 

12 7 but the manifest of the spirit is given to everi man to 
profit withal 

12 8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to anoth 
the word of knowledg by the same spirit 12 9 to anoth faith by the 
same spirit to anoth the gift of heal by the same spirit 12 10 
to anoth the work of miracl to anoth propheci to anoth 
discern of spirit to anoth diver kind of tongu to anoth 
the interpret of tongu 12 11 but all these worketh that one 
and the selfsam spirit divid to everi man sever a he will 

12 12 for a the bodi is one and hath mani member and all the 
member of that one bodi be mani are one bodi so also is christ 

12 13 for by one spirit are we all baptiz into one bodi whether we 
be jew or gentil whether we be bond or free and have been all 
made to drink into one spirit 

12 14 for the bodi is not one member but mani 

12 15 if the foot shall say becau i am not the hand i am not of 
the bodi is it therefor not of the bodi 12 16 and if the ear shall 
say becau i am not the eye i am not of the bodi is it therefor 
not of the bodi 12 17 if the whole bodi were an eye where were the 
hear if the whole were hear where were the smell 12 18 
but now hath god set the member everi one of them in the bodi a it 
hath plea him 

12 19 and if they were all one member where were the bodi 12 20 but 
now are they mani member yet but one bodi 

12 21 and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee 
nor again the head to the foot i have no need of you 

12 22 nay much more those member of the bodi which seem to be more 
feebl are necessari 12 23 and those member of the bodi which we 
think to be le honour upon these we bestow more abund 
honour and our uncom part have more abund come 

12 24 for our come part have no need but god hath temper the 
bodi togeth have given more abund honour to that part which 
lack 

12 25 that there should be no schism in the bodi but that the member 
should have the same care one for anoth 

12 26 and whether one member suffer all the member suffer with it 
or one member be honour all the member rejoic with it 

12 27 now ye are the bodi of christ and member in particular 

12 28 and god hath set some in the church first apostl secondarili 
prophet thirdli teacher after that miracl then gift of 
heal help govern diver of tongu 

12 29 are all apostl are all prophet are all teacher are all 
worker of miracl 12 30 have all the gift of heal do all 
speak with tongu do all interpret 12 31 but covet earnestli the 
best gift and yet shew i unto you a more excel way 

13 1 though i speak with the tongu of men and of angel and have 
not chariti i am becom a sound brass or a tinkl cymbal 

13 2 and though i have the gift of propheci and understand all 
mysteri and all knowledg and though i have all faith so that i 
could remov mountain and have not chariti i am noth 

13 3 and though i bestow all my good to feed the poor and though i 
give my bodi to be burn and have not chariti it profiteth me 
noth 

13 4 chariti suffereth long and is kind chariti envieth not chariti 
vaunteth not itself is not puf up 13 5 doth not behav itself 
unseemli seeketh not her own is not easili provok thinketh no 
evil 13 6 rejoiceth not in iniqu but rejoiceth in the truth 13 7 
beareth all thing believeth all thing hopeth all thing endureth 
all thing 

13 8 chariti never faileth but whether there be propheci they 
shall fail whether there be tongu they shall cea whether there 
be knowledg it shall vanish away 

13 9 for we know in part and we prophesi in part 

13 10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in 
part shall be done away 

13 11 when i wa a child i spake a a child i understood a a child 
i thought a a child but when i becam a man i put away childish 
thing 

13 12 for now we see through a glass darkli but then face to face 
now i know in part but then shall i know even a also i am known 

13 13 and now abideth faith hope chariti these three but the 
greatest of these is chariti 

14 1 follow after chariti and desir spiritu gift but rather that 
ye may prophesi 

14 2 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongu speaketh not unto men 
but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he 
speaketh mysteri 

14 3 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edif and 
exhort and comfort 

14 4 he that speaketh in an unknown tongu edifieth himself but he 
that prophesieth edifieth the church 

14 5 i would that ye all spake with tongu but rather that ye 
prophesi for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh 
with tongu except he interpret that the church may receiv 
edifi 

14 6 now brother if i come unto you speak with tongu what 
shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revel 
or by knowledg or by prophesi or by doctrin 14 7 and even 
thing without life give sound whether pipe or harp except they 
give a distinct in the sound how shall it be known what is pipe 
or harp 14 8 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall 
prepar himself to the battl 14 9 so likewi ye except ye utter 
by the tongu word easi to be understood how shall it be known what 
is spoken for ye shall speak into the air 

14 10 there are it may be so mani kind of voic in the world and 
none of them is without signif 

14 11 therefor if i know not the mean of the voic i shall be 
unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a 
barbarian unto me 

14 12 even so ye forasmuch a ye are zealou of spiritu gift seek 
that ye may excel to the edifi of the church 

14 13 wherefor let him that speaketh in an unknown tongu pray that 
he may interpret 

14 14 for if i pray in an unknown tongu my spirit prayeth but my 
understand is unfruit 

14 15 what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray 
with the understand also i will sing with the spirit and i will 
sing with the understand also 

14 16 el when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that 
occupieth the room of the unlearn say amen at thi give of thank 
see he understandeth not what thou sayest 14 17 for thou verili 
givest thank well but the other is not edifi 

14 18 i thank my god i speak with tongu more than ye all 14 19 yet 
in the church i had rather speak five word with my understand 
that by my voic i might teach other also than ten thousand word in 
an unknown tongu 

14 20 brother be not child in understand howbeit in malic be 
ye child but in understand be men 

14 21 in the law it is written with men of other tongu and other 
lip will i speak unto thi peopl and yet for all that will they not 
hear me saith the lord 

14 22 wherefor tongu are for a sign not to them that believ but 
to them that believ not but prophesi serveth not for them that 
believ not but for them which believ 

14 23 if therefor the whole church be come togeth into one place 
and all speak with tongu and there come in those that are 
unlearn or unbeliev will they not say that ye are mad 14 24 
but if all prophesi and there come in one that believeth not or one 
unlearn he is convinc of all he is judg of all 14 25 and thu 
are the secret of hi heart made manifest and so fall down on hi 
face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth 

14 26 how is it then brother when ye come togeth everi one of 
you hath a psalm hath a doctrin hath a tongu hath a revel 
hath an interpret let all thing be done unto edifi 

14 27 if ani man speak in an unknown tongu let it be by two or at 
the most by three and that by cour and let one interpret 

14 28 but if there be no interpret let him keep silenc in the 
church and let him speak to himself and to god 

14 29 let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judg 

14 30 if ani thing be reveal to anoth that sitteth by let the 
first hold hi peac 

14 31 for ye may all prophesi one by one that all may learn and all 
may be comfort 

14 32 and the spirit of the prophet are subject to the prophet 

14 33 for god is not the author of confu but of peac a in all 
church of the saint 

14 34 let your woman keep silenc in the church for it is not 
permit unto them to speak but they are command to be under 
obedi a also saith the law 

14 35 and if they will learn ani thing let them ask their husband at 
home for it is a shame for woman to speak in the church 

14 36 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you 
onli 14 37 if ani man think himself to be a prophet or spiritu 
let him acknowledg that the thing that i write unto you are the 
command of the lord 

14 38 but if ani man be ignor let him be ignor 

14 39 wherefor brother covet to prophesi and forbid not to speak 
with tongu 

14 40 let all thing be done decent and in order 

15 1 moreov brother i declar unto you the gospel which i 
preach unto you which also ye have receiv and wherein ye stand 
15 2 by which also ye are save if ye keep in memori what i preach 
unto you unless ye have believ in vain 

15 3 for i deliv unto you first of all that which i also receiv 
how that christ die for our sin accord to the scriptur 15 4 
and that he wa buri and that he rose again the third day accord 
to the scriptur 15 5 and that he wa seen of cepha then of the 
twelv 15 6 after that he wa seen of abov five hundr brother at 
onc of whom the greater part remain unto thi present but some are 
fallen asleep 

15 7 after that he wa seen of jame then of all the apostl 

15 8 and last of all he wa seen of me also a of one born out of due 
time 

15 9 for i am the least of the apostl that am not meet to be call 
an apostl becau i persecut the church of god 

15 10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and hi grace which wa 
bestow upon me wa not in vain but i labour more abundantli than 
they all yet not i but the grace of god which wa with me 

15 11 therefor whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye 
believ 

15 12 now if christ be preach that he rose from the dead how say 
some among you that there is no resurrect of the dead 15 13 but 
if there be no resurrect of the dead then is christ not risen 
15 14 and if christ be not risen then is our preach vain and your 
faith is also vain 

15 15 yea and we are found fal wit of god becau we have 
testifi of god that he rai up christ whom he rai not up if 
so be that the dead rise not 

15 16 for if the dead rise not then is not christ rai 15 17 and 
if christ be not rai your faith is vain ye are yet in your sin 

15 18 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perish 

15 19 if in thi life onli we have hope in christ we are of all men 
most miser 

15 20 but now is christ risen from the dead and becom the 
firstfruit of them that slept 

15 21 for sinc by man came death by man came also the resurrect 
of the dead 

15 22 for a in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made 
aliv 

15 23 but everi man in hi own order christ the firstfruit 
afterward they that are christ s at hi come 

15 24 then cometh the end when he shall have deliv up the kingdom 
to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all 
author and power 

15 25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemi under hi foot 

15 26 the last enemi that shall be destroy is death 

15 27 for he hath put all thing under hi foot but when he saith all 
thing are put under him it is manifest that he is except which 
did put all thing under him 

15 28 and when all thing shall be subdu unto him then shall the 
son also himself be subject unto him that put all thing under him 
that god may be all in all 

15 29 el what shall they do which are baptiz for the dead if the 
dead rise not at all whi are they then baptiz for the dead 15 30 
and whi stand we in jeopardi everi hour 15 31 i protest by your 
rejoic which i have in christ jesu our lord i die daili 

15 32 if after the manner of men i have fought with beast at ephesu 
what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let u eat and drink 
for to morrow we die 

15 33 be not deceiv evil commun corrupt good manner 

15 34 awak to righteou and sin not for some have not the 
knowledg of god i speak thi to your shame 

15 35 but some man will say how are the dead rai up and with what 
bodi do they come 15 36 thou fool that which thou sowest is not 
quicken except it die 15 37 and that which thou sowest thou 
sowest not that bodi that shall be but bare grain it may chanc of 
wheat or of some other grain 15 38 but god giveth it a bodi a it 
hath plea him and to everi seed hi own bodi 

15 39 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh 
of men anoth flesh of beast anoth of fish and anoth of 
bird 

15 40 there are also celesti bodi and bodi terrestri but the 
glori of the celesti is one and the glori of the terrestri is 
anoth 

15 41 there is one glori of the sun and anoth glori of the moon 
and anoth glori of the star for one star differeth from anoth 
star in glori 

15 42 so also is the resurrect of the dead it is sown in 
corrupt it is rai in incorrupt 15 43 it is sown in 
dishonour it is rai in glori it is sown in weak it is rai 
in power 15 44 it is sown a natur bodi it is rai a spiritu 
bodi there is a natur bodi and there is a spiritu bodi 

15 45 and so it is written the first man adam wa made a live soul 
the last adam wa made a quicken spirit 

15 46 howbeit that wa not first which is spiritu but that which is 
natur and afterward that which is spiritu 

15 47 the first man is of the earth earthi the second man is the 
lord from heaven 

15 48 a is the earthi such are they also that are earthi and a is 
the heavenli such are they also that are heavenli 

15 49 and a we have born the imag of the earthi we shall also bear 
the imag of the heavenli 

15 50 now thi i say brother that flesh and blood cannot inherit 
the kingdom of god neither doth corrupt inherit incorrupt 

15 51 behold i shew you a mysteri we shall not all sleep but we 
shall all be chang 15 52 in a moment in the twinkl of an eye 
at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be 
rai incorrupt and we shall be chang 

15 53 for thi corrupt must put on incorrupt and thi mortal 
must put on immort 

15 54 so when thi corrupt shall have put on incorrupt and 
thi mortal shall have put on immort then shall be brought to 
pa the say that is written death is swallow up in victori 

15 55 o death where is thi sting o grave where is thi victori 
15 56 the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law 

15 57 but thank be to god which giveth u the victori through our 
lord jesu christ 

15 58 therefor my belov brother be ye stedfast unmov 
alway abound in the work of the lord forasmuch a ye know that 
your labour is not in vain in the lord 

16 1 now concern the collect for the saint a i have given 
order to the church of galatia even so do ye 

16 2 upon the first day of the week let everi one of you lay by him in 
store a god hath prosper him that there be no gather when i 
come 

16 3 and when i come whomsoev ye shall approv by your letter 
them will i send to bring your liber unto jerusalem 

16 4 and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me 

16 5 now i will come unto you when i shall pa through macedonia 
for i do pa through macedonia 

16 6 and it may be that i will abid yea and winter with you that 
ye may bring me on my journey whithersoev i go 

16 7 for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarri a 
while with you if the lord permit 

16 8 but i will tarri at ephesu until pentecost 

16 9 for a great door and effectu is open unto me and there are 
mani adversari 

16 10 now if timotheu come see that he may be with you without fear 
for he worketh the work of the lord a i also do 

16 11 let no man therefor despi him but conduct him forth in 
peac that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brother 

16 12 a touch our brother apollo i greatli desir him to come 
unto you with the brother but hi will wa not at all to come at 
thi time but he will come when he shall have conveni time 

16 13 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong 

16 14 let all your thing be done with chariti 

16 15 i beseech you brother ye know the hou of stephana that 
it is the firstfruit of achaia and that they have addict 
themselv to the ministri of the saint 16 16 that ye submit 
yourselv unto such and to everi one that helpeth with u and 
laboureth 

16 17 i am glad of the come of stephana and fortunatu and 
achaicu for that which wa lack on your part they have suppli 

16 18 for they have refresh my spirit and your s therefor 
acknowledg ye them that are such 

16 19 the church of asia salut you aquila and priscilla salut you 
much in the lord with the church that is in their hou 

16 20 all the brother greet you greet ye one anoth with 
an holi kiss 

16 21 the salut of me paul with mine own hand 

16 22 if ani man love not the lord jesu christ let him be 
anathema maranatha 

16 23 the grace of our lord jesu christ be with you 

16 24 my love be with you all in christ jesu amen 




the second epistl of paul the apostl to the corinthian 


1 1 paul an apostl of jesu christ by the will of god and timothi 
our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the 
saint which are in all achaia 1 2 grace be to you and peac from god 
our father and from the lord jesu christ 

1 3 bless be god even the father of our lord jesu christ the 
father of merci and the god of all comfort 1 4 who comforteth u 
in all our tribul that we may be abl to comfort them which are 
in ani troubl by the comfort wherewith we ourselv are comfort of 
god 

1 5 for a the suffer of christ abound in u so our consol 
also aboundeth by christ 

1 6 and whether we be afflict it is for your consol and 
salvat which is effectu in the endur of the same suffer 
which we also suffer or whether we be comfort it is for your 
consol and salvat 

1 7 and our hope of you is stedfast know that a ye are partak 
of the suffer so shall ye be also of the consol 

1 8 for we would not brother have you ignor of our troubl which 
came to u in asia that we were press out of measur abov 
strength insomuch that we despair even of life 1 9 but we had the 
sentenc of death in ourselv that we should not trust in ourselv 
but in god which raiseth the dead 1 10 who deliv u from so great 
a death and doth deliv in whom we trust that he will yet deliv 
u 1 11 ye also help togeth by prayer for u that for the gift 
bestow upon u by the mean of mani person thank may be given by 
mani on our behalf 

1 12 for our rejoic is thi the testimoni of our conscienc that 
in simplic and godli sincer not with fleshli wisdom but by the 
grace of god we have had our conver in the world and more 
abundantli to you ward 

1 13 for we write none other thing unto you than what ye read or 
acknowledg and i trust ye shall acknowledg even to the end 1 14 a 
also ye have acknowledg u in part that we are your rejoic even 
a ye also are our s in the day of the lord jesu 

1 15 and in thi confid i wa mind to come unto you befor that 
ye might have a second benefit 1 16 and to pa by you into 
macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to 
be brought on my way toward judaea 

1 17 when i therefor wa thu mind did i use light or the 
thing that i purpo do i purpo accord to the flesh that with 
me there should be yea yea and nay nay 1 18 but a god is true our 
word toward you wa not yea and nay 

1 19 for the son of god jesu christ who wa preach among you by 
u even by me and silvanu and timotheu wa not yea and nay but in 
him wa yea 

1 20 for all the promi of god in him are yea and in him amen unto 
the glori of god by u 

1 21 now he which stablisheth u with you in christ and hath anoint 
u is god 1 22 who hath also seal u and given the earnest of the 
spirit in our heart 

1 23 moreov i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you 
i came not a yet unto corinth 

1 24 not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helper of 
your joy for by faith ye stand 

2 1 but i determin thi with myself that i would not come again to 
you in heavi 

2 2 for if i make you sorri who is he then that maketh me glad but 
the same which is made sorri by me 2 3 and i wrote thi same unto 
you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought 
to rejoic have confid in you all that my joy is the joy of 
you all 

2 4 for out of much afflict and anguish of heart i wrote unto you 
with mani tear not that ye should be griev but that ye might know 
the love which i have more abundantli unto you 

2 5 but if ani have cau grief he hath not griev me but in part 
that i may not overcharg you all 

2 6 suffici to such a man is thi punish which wa inflict 
of mani 

2 7 so that contrariwi ye ought rather to forgiv him and comfort 
him lest perhap such a one should be swallow up with overmuch 
sorrow 

2 8 wherefor i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward 
him 

2 9 for to thi end also did i write that i might know the proof of 
you whether ye be obedi in all thing 

2 10 to whom ye forgiv ani thing i forgiv also for if i forgav 
ani thing to whom i forgav it for your sake forgav i it in the 
person of christ 2 11 lest satan should get an advantag of u for 
we are not ignor of hi devic 

2 12 furthermor when i came to troa to preach christ s gospel and 
a door wa open unto me of the lord 2 13 i had no rest in my 
spirit becau i found not titu my brother but take my leav of 
them i went from thenc into macedonia 

2 14 now thank be unto god which alway causeth u to triumph in 
christ and maketh manifest the savour of hi knowledg by u in everi 
place 

2 15 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are 
save and in them that perish 2 16 to the one we are the savour of 
death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and 
who is suffici for these thing 2 17 for we are not a mani 
which corrupt the word of god but a of sincer but a of god in 
the sight of god speak we in christ 

3 1 do we begin again to commend ourselv or need we a some 
other epistl of commend to you or letter of commend 
from you 3 2 ye are our epistl written in our heart known and 
read of all men 3 3 forasmuch a ye are manifestli declar to be the 
epistl of christ minist by u written not with ink but with the 
spirit of the live god not in tabl of stone but in fleshi tabl 
of the heart 

3 4 and such trust have we through christ to god ward 3 5 not that we 
are suffici of ourselv to think ani thing a of ourselv but 
our suffici is of god 3 6 who also hath made u abl minist of 
the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the 
letter killeth but the spirit giveth life 

3 7 but if the ministr of death written and engraven in stone 
wa gloriou so that the child of israel could not stedfastli 
behold the face of mose for the glori of hi counten which glori 
wa to be done away 3 8 how shall not the ministr of the spirit 
be rather gloriou 3 9 for if the ministr of condemn be 
glori much more doth the ministr of righteou exceed in 
glori 

3 10 for even that which wa made gloriou had no glori in thi 
respect by reason of the glori that excelleth 

3 11 for if that which is done away wa gloriou much more that which 
remaineth is gloriou 

3 12 see then that we have such hope we use great plain of 
speech 3 13 and not a mose which put a vail over hi face that 
the child of israel could not stedfastli look to the end of that 
which is abolish 3 14 but their mind were blind for until thi 
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the read of the old 
testament which vail is done away in christ 

3 15 but even unto thi day when mose is read the vail is upon 
their heart 

3 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be 
taken away 

3 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is 
there is liberti 

3 18 but we all with open face behold a in a glass the glori of 
the lord are chang into the same imag from glori to glori even a 
by the spirit of the lord 

4 1 therefor see we have thi ministri a we have receiv merci 
we faint not 4 2 but have renounc the hidden thing of dishonesti 
not walk in crafti nor handl the word of god deceit 
but by manifest of the truth commend ourselv to everi man s 
conscienc in the sight of god 

4 3 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost 4 4 in 
whom the god of thi world hath blind the mind of them which 
believ not lest the light of the gloriou gospel of christ who is 
the imag of god should shine unto them 

4 5 for we preach not ourselv but christ jesu the lord and 
ourselv your servant for jesu sake 

4 6 for god who command the light to shine out of dark hath 
shine in our heart to give the light of the knowledg of the glori 
of god in the face of jesu christ 

4 7 but we have thi treasur in earthen vessel that the excel 
of the power may be of god and not of u 

4 8 we are troubl on everi side yet not distress we are 
perplex but not in despair 4 9 persecut but not forsaken cast 
down but not destroy 4 10 alway bear about in the bodi the 
die of the lord jesu that the life also of jesu might be made 
manifest in our bodi 

4 11 for we which live are alway deliv unto death for jesu sake 
that the life also of jesu might be made manifest in our mortal 
flesh 

4 12 so then death worketh in u but life in you 

4 13 we have the same spirit of faith accord a it is written i 
believ and therefor have i spoken we also believ and therefor 
speak 4 14 know that he which rai up the lord jesu shall rai 
up u also by jesu and shall present u with you 

4 15 for all thing are for your sake that the abund grace might 
through the thanksgiv of mani redound to the glori of god 

4 16 for which cau we faint not but though our outward man perish 
yet the inward man is renew day by day 

4 17 for our light afflict which is but for a moment worketh for 
u a far more exceed and etern weight of glori 4 18 while we 
look not at the thing which are seen but at the thing which are not 
seen for the thing which are seen are tempor but the thing which 
are not seen are etern 

5 1 for we know that if our earthli hou of thi tabernacl were 
dissolv we have a build of god an hou not made with hand 
etern in the heaven 

5 2 for in thi we groan earnestli desir to be cloth upon with 
our hou which is from heaven 5 3 if so be that be cloth we 
shall not be found nake 

5 4 for we that are in thi tabernacl do groan be burden not 
for that we would be uncloth but cloth upon that mortal might 
be swallow up of life 

5 5 now he that hath wrought u for the selfsam thing is god who 
also hath given unto u the earnest of the spirit 

5 6 therefor we are alway confid know that whilst we are at 
home in the bodi we are absent from the lord 5 7 for we walk by 
faith not by sight 5 8 we are confid i say and will rather 
to be absent from the bodi and to be present with the lord 

5 9 wherefor we labour that whether present or absent we may be 
accept of him 

5 10 for we must all appear befor the judgment seat of christ that 
everi one may receiv the thing done in hi bodi accord to that 
he hath done whether it be good or bad 

5 11 know therefor the terror of the lord we persuad men but we 
are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your 
conscienc 

5 12 for we commend not ourselv again unto you but give you 
occa to glori on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer 
them which glori in appear and not in heart 

5 13 for whether we be besid ourselv it is to god or whether we 
be sober it is for your cau 

5 14 for the love of christ constraineth u becau we thu judg 
that if one die for all then were all dead 5 15 and that he die 
for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto 
themselv but unto him which die for them and rose again 

5 16 wherefor henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though 
we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him 
no more 

5 17 therefor if ani man be in christ he is a new creatur old 
thing are pa away behold all thing are becom new 

5 18 and all thing are of god who hath reconcil u to himself by 
jesu christ and hath given to u the ministri of reconcili 
5 19 to wit that god wa in christ reconcil the world unto 
himself not imput their trespass unto them and hath commit 
unto u the word of reconcili 

5 20 now then we are ambassador for christ a though god did beseech 
you by u we pray you in christ s stead be ye reconcil to god 

5 21 for he hath made him to be sin for u who knew no sin that we 
might be made the righteou of god in him 

6 1 we then a worker togeth with him beseech you also that ye 
receiv not the grace of god in vain 

6 2 for he saith i have heard thee in a time accept and in the 
day of salvat have i succour thee behold now is the accept 
time behold now is the day of salvat 6 3 give no offenc in 
ani thing that the ministri be not blame 6 4 but in all thing 
approv ourselv a the minist of god in much patienc in 
afflict in necess in distress 6 5 in stripe in 
imprison in tumult in labour in watch in fast 6 6 
by pure by knowledg by longsuff by kind by the holi 
ghost by love unfeign 6 7 by the word of truth by the power of 
god by the armour of righteou on the right hand and on the left 
6 8 by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report a 
deceiv and yet true 6 9 a unknown and yet well known a die 
and behold we live a chasten and not kill 6 10 a sorrow 
yet alway rejoic a poor yet make mani rich a have noth 
and yet poss all thing 

6 11 o ye corinthian our mouth is open unto you our heart is 
enlarg 

6 12 ye are not straiten in u but ye are straiten in your own 
bowel 

6 13 now for a recomp in the same i speak a unto my child 
be ye also enlarg 

6 14 be ye not unequ yoke togeth with unbeliev for what 
fellowship hath righteou with unright and what communion 
hath light with dark 6 15 and what concord hath christ with 
belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel 6 16 and 
what agreement hath the templ of god with idol for ye are the 
templ of the live god a god hath said i will dwell in them and 
walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my peopl 

6 17 wherefor come out from among them and be ye separ saith the 
lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receiv you 

6 18 and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my son and 
daughter saith the lord almighti 

7 1 have therefor these promi dearli belov let u clean 
ourselv from all filthi of the flesh and spirit perfect 
holi in the fear of god 

7 2 receiv u we have wrong no man we have corrupt no man we 
have defraud no man 

7 3 i speak not thi to condemn you for i have said befor that ye 
are in our heart to die and live with you 

7 4 great is my bold of speech toward you great is my glori of 
you i am fill with comfort i am exceed joy in all our 
tribul 

7 5 for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but 
we were troubl on everi side without were fight within were 
fear 

7 6 nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down 
comfort u by the come of titu 7 7 and not by hi come onli 
but by the consol wherewith he wa comfort in you when he told 
u your earnest desir your mourn your fervent mind toward me so 
that i rejoic the more 

7 8 for though i made you sorri with a letter i do not repent though 
i did repent for i perceiv that the same epistl hath made you 
sorri though it were but for a season 

7 9 now i rejoic not that ye were made sorri but that ye sorrow 
to repent for ye were made sorri after a godli manner that ye 
might receiv damag by u in noth 

7 10 for godli sorrow worketh repent to salvat not to be 
repent of but the sorrow of the world worketh death 

7 11 for behold thi selfsam thing that ye sorrow after a godli 
sort what care it wrought in you yea what clear of 
yourselv yea what indign yea what fear yea what vehement 
desir yea what zeal yea what reveng in all thing ye have 
approv yourselv to be clear in thi matter 

7 12 wherefor though i wrote unto you i did it not for hi cau 
that had done the wrong nor for hi cau that suffer wrong but 
that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you 

7 13 therefor we were comfort in your comfort yea and exceedingli 
the more joy we for the joy of titu becau hi spirit wa 
refresh by you all 

7 14 for if i have boast ani thing to him of you i am not asham 
but a we spake all thing to you in truth even so our boast 
which i made befor titu is found a truth 

7 15 and hi inward affect is more abund toward you whilst he 
remembereth the obedi of you all how with fear and trembl ye 
receiv him 

7 16 i rejoic therefor that i have confid in you in all thing 

8 1 moreov brother we do you to wit of the grace of god bestow 
on the church of macedonia 8 2 how that in a great trial of 
afflict the abund of their joy and their deep poverti abound 
unto the rich of their liber 

8 3 for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power 
they were will of themselv 8 4 pray u with much intreati 
that we would receiv the gift and take upon u the fellowship of the 
minist to the saint 

8 5 and thi they did not a we hope but first gave their own 
self to the lord and unto u by the will of god 

8 6 insomuch that we desir titu that a he had begun so he would 
also finish in you the same grace also 

8 7 therefor a ye abound in everi thing in faith and utter 
and knowledg and in all dilig and in your love to u see that 
ye abound in thi grace also 

8 8 i speak not by command but by occa of the forward of 
other and to prove the sincer of your love 

8 9 for ye know the grace of our lord jesu christ that though he 
wa rich yet for your sake he becam poor that ye through hi 
poverti might be rich 

8 10 and herein i give my advic for thi is expedi for you who 
have begun befor not onli to do but also to be forward a year ago 

8 11 now therefor perform the do of it that a there wa a 
readi to will so there may be a perform also out of that 
which ye have 

8 12 for if there be first a will mind it is accept accord to 
that a man hath and not accord to that he hath not 

8 13 for i mean not that other men be ea and ye burden 8 14 but 
by an equal that now at thi time your abund may be a suppli 
for their want that their abund also may be a suppli for your 
want that there may be equal 8 15 a it is written he that had 
gather much had noth over and he that had gather littl had no 
lack 

8 16 but thank be to god which put the same earnest care into the 
heart of titu for you 

8 17 for ind he accept the exhort but be more forward 
of hi own accord he went unto you 

8 18 and we have sent with him the brother whose prai is in the 
gospel throughout all the church 8 19 and not that onli but who 
wa also chosen of the church to travel with u with thi grace 
which is administ by u to the glori of the same lord and 
declar of your readi mind 8 20 avoid thi that no man should 
blame u in thi abund which is administ by u 8 21 provid 
for honest thing not onli in the sight of the lord but also in the 
sight of men 

8 22 and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentim 
prove dilig in mani thing but now much more dilig upon the 
great confid which i have in you 

8 23 whether ani do enquir of titu he is my partner and 
fellowhelp concern you or our brother be enquir of they are 
the messeng of the church and the glori of christ 

8 24 wherefor shew ye to them and befor the church the proof of 
your love and of our boast on your behalf 

9 1 for a touch the minist to the saint it is superflu 
for me to write to you 9 2 for i know the forward of your mind 
for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia wa readi a 
year ago and your zeal hath provok veri mani 

9 3 yet have i sent the brother lest our boast of you should be 
in vain in thi behalf that a i said ye may be readi 9 4 lest 
hapli if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepar we 
that we say not ye should be asham in thi same confid 
boast 

9 5 therefor i thought it necessari to exhort the brother that they 
would go befor unto you and make up beforehand your bounti whereof 
ye had notic befor that the same might be readi a a matter of 
bounti and not a of covet 

9 6 but thi i say he which soweth sparingli shall reap also 
sparingli and he which soweth bounti shall reap also 
bounti 

9 7 everi man accord a he purposeth in hi heart so let him give 
not grudgingli or of necess for god loveth a cheer giver 

9 8 and god is abl to make all grace abound toward you that ye 
alway have all suffici in all thing may abound to everi good 
work 9 9 a it is written he hath disper abroad he hath given 
to the poor hi righteou remaineth for ever 

9 10 now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minist bread for 
your food and multipli your seed sown and increa the fruit of 
your righteou 9 11 be enrich in everi thing to all 
bounti which causeth through u thanksgiv to god 

9 12 for the administr of thi servic not onli supplieth the 
want of the saint but is abund also by mani thanksgiv unto 
god 9 13 while by the experi of thi ministr they glorifi 
god for your profess subject unto the gospel of christ and for 
your liber distribut unto them and unto all men 9 14 and by 
their prayer for you which long after you for the exceed grace of 
god in you 

9 15 thank be unto god for hi unspeak gift 

10 1 now i paul myself beseech you by the meek and gentl of 
christ who in presenc am base among you but be absent am bold 
toward you 10 2 but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am 
present with that confid wherewith i think to be bold against 
some which think of u a if we walk accord to the flesh 

10 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh 
10 4 for the weapon of our warfar are not carnal but mighti 
through god to the pull down of strong hold 10 5 cast down 
imagin and everi high thing that exalteth itself against the 
knowledg of god and bring into captiv everi thought to the 
obedi of christ 10 6 and have in a readi to reveng all 
disobedi when your obedi is fulfil 

10 7 do ye look on thing after the outward appear if ani man 
trust to himself that he is christ s let him of himself think thi 
again that a he is christ s even so are we christ s 

10 8 for though i should boast somewhat more of our author which 
the lord hath given u for edif and not for your destruct 
i should not be asham 10 9 that i may not seem a if i would 
terrifi you by letter 

10 10 for hi letter say they are weighti and power but hi 
bodili presenc is weak and hi speech contempt 

10 11 let such an one think thi that such a we are in word by 
letter when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are 
present 

10 12 for we dare not make ourselv of the number or compar 
ourselv with some that commend themselv but they measur 
themselv by themselv and compar themselv among themselv 
are not wise 

10 13 but we will not boast of thing without our measur but 
accord to the measur of the rule which god hath distribut to u 
a measur to reach even unto you 

10 14 for we stretch not ourselv beyond our measur a though we 
reach not unto you for we are come a far a to you also in 
preach the gospel of christ 10 15 not boast of thing without 
our measur that is of other men s labour but have hope when 
your faith is increa that we shall be enlarg by you accord to 
our rule abundantli 10 16 to preach the gospel in the region beyond 
you and not to boast in anoth man s line of thing made readi to 
our hand 

10 17 but he that glorieth let him glori in the lord 

10 18 for not he that commendeth himself is approv but whom the 
lord commendeth 

11 1 would to god ye could bear with me a littl in my folli and 
ind bear with me 

11 2 for i am jealou over you with godli jealousi for i have 
espou you to one husband that i may present you a a chast virgin 
to christ 

11 3 but i fear lest by ani mean a the serpent beguil eve 
through hi subtilti so your mind should be corrupt from the 
simplic that is in christ 

11 4 for if he that cometh preacheth anoth jesu whom we have not 
preach or if ye receiv anoth spirit which ye have not receiv 
or anoth gospel which ye have not accept ye might well bear with 
him 

11 5 for i suppo i wa not a whit behind the veri chiefest apostl 

11 6 but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledg but we have 
been throughli made manifest among you in all thing 

11 7 have i commit an offenc in aba myself that ye might be 
exalt becau i have preach to you the gospel of god freeli 
11 8 i rob other church take wage of them to do you servic 

11 9 and when i wa present with you and want i wa chargeabl to 
no man for that which wa lack to me the brother which came from 
macedonia suppli and in all thing i have kept myself from be 
burdensom unto you and so will i keep myself 

11 10 a the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of thi 
boast in the region of achaia 

11 11 wherefor becau i love you not god knoweth 

11 12 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occa from 
them which desir occa that wherein they glori they may be found 
even a we 

11 13 for such are fal apostl deceit worker transform 
themselv into the apostl of christ 

11 14 and no marvel for satan himself is transform into an angel of 
light 

11 15 therefor it is no great thing if hi minist also be 
transform a the minist of righteou whose end shall be 
accord to their work 

11 16 i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwi yet a a 
fool receiv me that i may boast myself a littl 

11 17 that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but a it 
were foolishli in thi confid of boast 

11 18 see that mani glori after the flesh i will glori also 

11 19 for ye suffer fool gladli see ye yourselv are wise 

11 20 for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondag if a man devour 
you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you 
on the face 

11 21 i speak a concern reproach a though we had been weak 
howbeit whereinsoev ani is bold i speak foolishli i am bold 
also 

11 22 are they hebrew so am i are they israelit so am i are 
they the seed of abraham so am i 

11 23 are they minist of christ i speak a a fool i am more in 
labour more abund in stripe abov measur in prison more 
frequent in death oft 

11 24 of the jew five time receiv i forti stripe save one 

11 25 thrice wa i beaten with rod onc wa i stone thrice i 
suffer shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep 11 26 
in journey often in peril of water in peril of robber in 
peril by mine own countryman in peril by the heathen in peril in 
the citi in peril in the wilder in peril in the sea in peril 
among fal brother 11 27 in weari and pain in watch 
often in hunger and thirst in fast often in cold and nake 

11 28 besid those thing that are without that which cometh upon me 
daili the care of all the church 

11 29 who is weak and i am not weak who is offend and i burn not 
11 30 if i must need glori i will glori of the thing which concern 
mine infirm 

11 31 the god and father of our lord jesu christ which is bless 
for evermor knoweth that i lie not 

11 32 in damascu the governor under areta the king kept the citi of 
the damascen with a garrison desir to apprehend me 11 33 and 
through a window in a basket wa i let down by the wall and escap 
hi hand 

12 1 it is not expedi for me doubtless to glori i will come to 
vision and revel of the lord 

12 2 i knew a man in christ abov fourteen year ago whether in the 
bodi i cannot tell or whether out of the bodi i cannot tell god 
knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven 

12 3 and i knew such a man whether in the bodi or out of the bodi 
i cannot tell god knoweth 12 4 how that he wa caught up into 
paradi and heard unspeak word which it is not law for a 
man to utter 

12 5 of such an one will i glori yet of myself i will not glori but 
in mine infirm 

12 6 for though i would desir to glori i shall not be a fool for i 
will say the truth but now i forbear lest ani man should think of me 
abov that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me 

12 7 and lest i should be exalt abov measur through the abund 
of the revel there wa given to me a thorn in the flesh the 
messeng of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalt abov 
measur 

12 8 for thi thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart 
from me 

12 9 and he said unto me my grace is suffici for thee for my 
strength is made perfect in weak most gladli therefor will i 
rather glori in my infirm that the power of christ may rest upon 
me 

12 10 therefor i take pleasur in infirm in reproach in 
necess in persecut in distress for christ s sake for 
when i am weak then am i strong 

12 11 i am becom a fool in glori ye have compel me for i 
ought to have been commend of you for in noth am i behind the 
veri chiefest apostl though i be noth 

12 12 truli the sign of an apostl were wrought among you in all 
patienc in sign and wonder and mighti deed 

12 13 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other church 
except it be that i myself wa not burdensom to you forgiv me thi 
wrong 

12 14 behold the third time i am readi to come to you and i will not 
be burdensom to you for i seek not your s but you for the child 
ought not to lay up for the parent but the parent for the child 

12 15 and i will veri gladli spend and be spent for you though the 
more abundantli i love you the le i be love 

12 16 but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless be crafti 
i caught you with guil 

12 17 did i make a gain of you by ani of them whom i sent unto you 
12 18 i desir titu and with him i sent a brother did titu make a 
gain of you walk we not in the same spirit walk we not in the 
same step 12 19 again think ye that we excu ourselv unto you 
we speak befor god in christ but we do all thing dearli belov 
for your edifi 

12 20 for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such a i 
would and that i shall be found unto you such a ye would not lest 
there be debat envi wrath strife backbit whisper 
swell tumult 12 21 and lest when i come again my god will 
humbl me among you and that i shall bewail mani which have sin 
alreadi and have not repent of the unclean and fornic and 
lascivi which they have commit 

13 1 thi is the third time i am come to you in the mouth of two or 
three wit shall everi word be establish 

13 2 i told you befor and foretel you a if i were present the 
second time and be absent now i write to them which heretofor 
have sin and to all other that if i come again i will not 
spare 13 3 sinc ye seek a proof of christ speak in me which to 
you ward is not weak but is mighti in you 

13 4 for though he wa crucifi through weak yet he liveth by 
the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with 
him by the power of god toward you 

13 5 examin yourselv whether ye be in the faith prove your own 
self know ye not your own self how that jesu christ is in you 
except ye be reprob 13 6 but i trust that ye shall know that we 
are not reprob 

13 7 now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear 
approv but that ye should do that which is honest though we be a 
reprob 

13 8 for we can do noth against the truth but for the truth 

13 9 for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and thi 
also we wish even your perfect 

13 10 therefor i write these thing be absent lest be present 
i should use sharp accord to the power which the lord hath 
given me to edif and not to destruct 

13 11 final brother farewel be perfect be of good comfort be 
of one mind live in peac and the god of love and peac shall be 
with you 

13 12 greet one anoth with an holi kiss 

13 13 all the saint salut you 

13 14 the grace of the lord jesu christ and the love of god and the 
communion of the holi ghost be with you all amen 




the epistl of paul the apostl to the galatian 


1 1 paul an apostl not of men neither by man but by jesu 
christ and god the father who rai him from the dead 1 2 and all 
the brother which are with me unto the church of galatia 1 3 
grace be to you and peac from god the father and from our lord jesu 
christ 1 4 who gave himself for our sin that he might deliv u 
from thi present evil world accord to the will of god and our 
father 1 5 to whom be glori for ever and ever amen 

1 6 i marvel that ye are so soon remov from him that call you into 
the grace of christ unto anoth gospel 1 7 which is not anoth but 
there be some that troubl you and would pervert the gospel of 
christ 

1 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach ani other gospel 
unto you than that which we have preach unto you let him be 
accur 

1 9 a we said befor so say i now again if ani man preach ani other 
gospel unto you than that ye have receiv let him be accur 

1 10 for do i now persuad men or god or do i seek to plea men 
for if i yet plea men i should not be the servant of christ 

1 11 but i certifi you brother that the gospel which wa preach 
of me is not after man 

1 12 for i neither receiv it of man neither wa i taught it but by 
the revel of jesu christ 

1 13 for ye have heard of my conver in time past in the jew 
religion how that beyond measur i persecut the church of god and 
wast it 1 14 and profit in the jew religion abov mani my 
equal in mine own nation be more exceedingli zealou of the 
tradit of my father 

1 15 but when it plea god who separ me from my mother s womb 
and call me by hi grace 1 16 to reveal hi son in me that i might 
preach him among the heathen immedi i confer not with flesh 
and blood 1 17 neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were 
apostl befor me but i went into arabia and return again unto 
damascu 

1 18 then after three year i went up to jerusalem to see peter and 
abod with him fifteen day 

1 19 but other of the apostl saw i none save jame the lord s 
brother 

1 20 now the thing which i write unto you behold befor god i lie 
not 

1 21 afterward i came into the region of syria and cilicia 1 22 and 
wa unknown by face unto the church of judaea which were in christ 
1 23 but they had heard onli that he which persecut u in time 
past now preacheth the faith which onc he destroy 

1 24 and they glorifi god in me 

2 1 then fourteen year after i went up again to jerusalem with 
barnaba and took titu with me also 

2 2 and i went up by revel and commun unto them that 
gospel which i preach among the gentil but privat to them which 
were of reput lest by ani mean i should run or had run in 
vain 

2 3 but neither titu who wa with me be a greek wa compel 
to be circumci 2 4 and that becau of fal brother unawar 
brought in who came in privili to spi out our liberti which we have 
in christ jesu that they might bring u into bondag 2 5 to whom we 
gave place by subject no not for an hour that the truth of the 
gospel might continu with you 

2 6 but of these who seem to be somewhat whatsoev they were it 
maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man s person for they who 
seem to be somewhat in confer ad noth to me 2 7 but 
contrariwi when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumci wa 
commit unto me a the gospel of the circumci wa unto peter 
2 8 for he that wrought effectu in peter to the apostleship of 
the circumci the same wa mighti in me toward the gentil 2 9 
and when jame cepha and john who seem to be pillar perceiv 
the grace that wa given unto me they gave to me and barnaba the 
right hand of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and 
they unto the circumci 

2 10 onli they would that we should rememb the poor the same which 
i also wa forward to do 

2 11 but when peter wa come to antioch i withstood him to the face 
becau he wa to be blame 

2 12 for befor that certain came from jame he did eat with the 
gentil but when they were come he withdrew and separ himself 
fear them which were of the circumci 

2 13 and the other jew dissembl likewi with him insomuch that 
barnaba also wa carri away with their dissimul 

2 14 but when i saw that they walk not uprightli accord to the 
truth of the gospel i said unto peter befor them all if thou be 
a jew livest after the manner of gentil and not a do the jew 
whi compellest thou the gentil to live a do the jew 2 15 we who 
are jew by natur and not sinner of the gentil 2 16 know that 
a man is not justifi by the work of the law but by the faith of 
jesu christ even we have believ in jesu christ that we might be 
justifi by the faith of christ and not by the work of the law for 
by the work of the law shall no flesh be justifi 

2 17 but if while we seek to be justifi by christ we ourselv 
also are found sinner is therefor christ the minist of sin god 
forbid 

2 18 for if i build again the thing which i destroy i make myself 
a transgressor 

2 19 for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto 
god 

2 20 i am crucifi with christ neverthless i live yet not i but 
christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live 
by the faith of the son of god who love me and gave himself for me 

2 21 i do not frustrat the grace of god for if righteou come by 
the law then christ is dead in vain 

3 1 o foolish galatian who hath bewitch you that ye should not 
obey the truth befor whose eye jesu christ hath been evid set 
forth crucifi among you 3 2 thi onli would i learn of you 
receiv ye the spirit by the work of the law or by the hear of 
faith 3 3 are ye so foolish have begun in the spirit are ye now 
made perfect by the flesh 3 4 have ye suffer so mani thing in 
vain if it be yet in vain 

3 5 he therefor that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh 
miracl among you doeth he it by the work of the law or by the 
hear of faith 3 6 even a abraham believ god and it wa 
account to him for righteou 

3 7 know ye therefor that they which are of faith the same are the 
child of abraham 

3 8 and the scriptur fores that god would justifi the heathen 
through faith preach befor the gospel unto abraham say in 
thee shall all nation be bless 

3 9 so then they which be of faith are bless with faith abraham 

3 10 for a mani a are of the work of the law are under the cur 
for it is written cur is everi one that continueth not in all 
thing which are written in the book of the law to do them 

3 11 but that no man is justifi by the law in the sight of god it 
is evid for the just shall live by faith 

3 12 and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall 
live in them 

3 13 christ hath redeem u from the cur of the law be made a 
cur for u for it is written cur is everi one that hangeth on a 
tree 3 14 that the bless of abraham might come on the gentil 
through jesu christ that we might receiv the promi of the spirit 
through faith 

3 15 brother i speak after the manner of men though it be but a 
man s coven yet if it be confirm no man disannulleth or addeth 
thereto 

3 16 now to abraham and hi seed were the promi made he saith not 
and to seed a of mani but a of one and to thi seed which is 
christ 

3 17 and thi i say that the coven that wa confirm befor of 
god in christ the law which wa four hundr and thirti year after 
cannot disannul that it should make the promi of none effect 

3 18 for if the inherit be of the law it is no more of promi 
but god gave it to abraham by promi 

3 19 wherefor then serveth the law it wa ad becau of 
transgress till the seed should come to whom the promi wa 
made and it wa ordain by angel in the hand of a mediat 

3 20 now a mediat is not a mediat of one but god is one 

3 21 is the law then against the promi of god god forbid for if 
there had been a law given which could have given life verili 
righteou should have been by the law 

3 22 but the scriptur hath conclud all under sin that the promi 
by faith of jesu christ might be given to them that believ 

3 23 but befor faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto 
the faith which should afterward be reveal 

3 24 wherefor the law wa our schoolmast to bring u unto christ 
that we might be justifi by faith 

3 25 but after that faith is come we are no longer under a 
schoolmast 

3 26 for ye are all the child of god by faith in christ jesu 

3 27 for a mani of you a have been baptiz into christ have put on 
christ 

3 28 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free 
there is neither male nor femal for ye are all one in christ jesu 

3 29 and if ye be christ s then are ye abraham s seed and heir 
accord to the promi 

4 1 now i say that the heir a long a he is a child differeth 
noth from a servant though he be lord of all 4 2 but is under 
tutor and governor until the time appoint of the father 

4 3 even so we when we were child were in bondag under the 
element of the world 4 4 but when the ful of the time wa come 
god sent forth hi son made of a woman made under the law 4 5 to 
redeem them that were under the law that we might receiv the 
adopt of son 

4 6 and becau ye are son god hath sent forth the spirit of hi son 
into your heart cri abba father 

4 7 wherefor thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son 
then an heir of god through christ 

4 8 howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did servic unto them which 
by natur are no god 

4 9 but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god 
how turn ye again to the weak and beggarli element whereunto ye 
desir again to be in bondag 4 10 ye observ day and month and 
time and year 

4 11 i am afraid of you lest i have bestow upon you labour in vain 

4 12 brother i beseech you be a i am for i am a ye are ye have 
not injur me at all 

4 13 ye know how through infirm of the flesh i preach the gospel 
unto you at the first 

4 14 and my temptat which wa in my flesh ye despi not nor 
reject but receiv me a an angel of god even a christ jesu 

4 15 where is then the bless ye spake of for i bear you record 
that if it had been possibl ye would have pluck out your own 
eye and have given them to me 

4 16 am i therefor becom your enemi becau i tell you the truth 
4 17 they zealou affect you but not well yea they would exclud 
you that ye might affect them 

4 18 but it is good to be zealou affect alway in a good thing 
and not onli when i am present with you 

4 19 my littl child of whom i travail in birth again until christ 
be form in you 4 20 i desir to be present with you now and to 
chang my voic for i stand in doubt of you 

4 21 tell me ye that desir to be under the law do ye not hear the 
law 4 22 for it is written that abraham had two son the one by a 
bondmaid the other by a freewoman 

4 23 but he who wa of the bondwoman wa born after the flesh but he 
of the freewoman wa by promi 

4 24 which thing are an allegori for these are the two coven 
the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondag which is 
agar 

4 25 for thi agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to 
jerusalem which now is and is in bondag with her child 

4 26 but jerusalem which is abov is free which is the mother of u 
all 

4 27 for it is written rejoic thou barren that bearest not break 
forth and cri thou that travailest not for the desol hath mani 
more child than she which hath an husband 

4 28 now we brother a isaac wa are the child of promi 

4 29 but a then he that wa born after the flesh persecut him that 
wa born after the spirit even so it is now 

4 30 nevertheless what saith the scriptur cast out the bondwoman and 
her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son 
of the freewoman 

4 31 so then brother we are not child of the bondwoman but of 
the free 

5 1 stand fast therefor in the liberti wherewith christ hath made u 
free and be not entangl again with the yoke of bondag 

5 2 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumci christ 
shall profit you noth 

5 3 for i testifi again to everi man that is circumci that he is a 
debtor to do the whole law 

5 4 christ is becom of no effect unto you whosoev of you are 
justifi by the law ye are fallen from grace 

5 5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteou by 
faith 

5 6 for in jesu christ neither circumci availeth ani thing nor 
uncircumci but faith which worketh by love 

5 7 ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the 
truth 5 8 thi persua cometh not of him that calleth you 

5 9 a littl leaven leaveneth the whole lump 

5 10 i have confid in you through the lord that ye will be none 
otherwi mind but he that troubleth you shall bear hi judgment 
whosoev he be 

5 11 and i brother if i yet preach circumci whi do i yet 
suffer persecut then is the offenc of the cross cea 

5 12 i would they were even cut off which troubl you 

5 13 for brother ye have been call unto liberti onli use not 
liberti for an occa to the flesh but by love serv one anoth 

5 14 for all the law is fulfil in one word even in thi thou 
shalt love thi neighbour a thyself 

5 15 but if ye bite and devour one anoth take heed that ye be not 
consum one of anoth 

5 16 thi i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the 
lust of the flesh 

5 17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against 
the flesh and these are contrari the one to the other so that ye 
cannot do the thing that ye would 

5 18 but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law 

5 19 now the work of the flesh are manifest which are these 
adulteri fornic unclean lascivi 5 20 idolatri 
witchcraft hatr varianc emul wrath strife sedit 
heresi 5 21 envi murder drunken revel and such 
like of the which i tell you befor a i have also told you in time 
past that they which do such thing shall not inherit the kingdom of 
god 

5 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peac longsuff 
gentl good faith 5 23 meek temper against such 
there is no law 

5 24 and they that are christ s have crucifi the flesh with the 
affect and lust 

5 25 if we live in the spirit let u also walk in the spirit 

5 26 let u not be desir of vain glori provok one anoth 
envi one anoth 

6 1 brother if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are 
spiritu restor such an one in the spirit of meek consid 
thyself lest thou also be tempt 

6 2 bear ye one anoth s burden and so fulfil the law of christ 

6 3 for if a man think himself to be someth when he is noth he 
deceiveth himself 

6 4 but let everi man prove hi own work and then shall he have 
rejoic in himself alon and not in anoth 

6 5 for everi man shall bear hi own burden 

6 6 let him that is taught in the word commun unto him that 
teacheth in all good thing 

6 7 be not deceiv god is not mock for whatsoev a man soweth 
that shall he also reap 

6 8 for he that soweth to hi flesh shall of the flesh reap 
corrupt but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap 
life everlast 

6 9 and let u not be weari in well do for in due season we shall 
reap if we faint not 

6 10 a we have therefor opportun let u do good unto all men 
especi unto them who are of the household of faith 

6 11 ye see how larg a letter i have written unto you with mine own 
hand 

6 12 a mani a desir to make a fair shew in the flesh they 
constrain you to be circumci onli lest they should suffer 
persecut for the cross of christ 

6 13 for neither they themselv who are circumci keep the law but 
desir to have you circumci that they may glori in your flesh 

6 14 but god forbid that i should glori save in the cross of our lord 
jesu christ by whom the world is crucifi unto me and i unto the 
world 

6 15 for in christ jesu neither circumci availeth ani thing nor 
uncircumci but a new creatur 

6 16 and a mani a walk accord to thi rule peac be on them and 
merci and upon the israel of god 

6 17 from henceforth let no man troubl me for i bear in my bodi the 
mark of the lord jesu 

6 18 brother the grace of our lord jesu christ be with your spirit 

amen

4 20 but ye have not so learn christ 4 21 if so be that ye have 
heard him and have been taught by him a the truth is in jesu 4 22 
that ye put off concern the former conver the old man which 
is corrupt accord to the deceit lust 4 23 and be renew in

4 28 let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour 
work with hi hand the thing which is good that he may have to 
give to him that needeth 

4 29 let no corrupt commun proceed out of your mouth but that

5 6 let no man deceiv you with vain word for becau of these 
thing cometh the wrath of god upon the child of disobedi 

5 7 be not ye therefor partak with them 

5 8 for ye were sometim dark but now are ye light in the lord 
walk a child of light 5 9 for the fruit of the spirit is in all 
good and righteou and truth 5 10 prove what is accept 
unto the lord 

5 11 and have no fellowship with the unfruit work of dark but 
rather reprov them 

5 12 for it is a shame even to speak of those thing which are done of 
them in secret 

5 13 but all thing that are reprov are made manifest by the light 
for whatsoev doth make manifest is light 

5 14 wherefor he saith awak thou that sleepest and ari from the 
dead and christ shall give thee light 

5 15 see then that ye walk circumspectli not a fool but a wise 
5 16 redeem the time becau the day are evil 

5 17 wherefor be ye not unwi but understand what the will of 
the lord is 

5 18 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be fill with

spiritu song sing and make melodi in your heart to the lord 
5 20 give thank alway for all thing unto god and the father in 
the name of our lord jesu christ 5 21 submit yourselv one to 
anoth in the fear of god 

5 22 wive submit yourselv unto your own husband a unto the 
lord 

5 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even a christ is the 
head of the church and he is the saviour of the bodi 

5 24 therefor a the church is subject unto christ so let the wife 
be to their own husband in everi thing 

5 25 husband love your wife even a christ also love the church 
and gave himself for it 5 26 that he might sanctifi and clean it 
with the wash of water by the word 5 27 that he might present it 
to himself a gloriou church not have spot or wrinkl or ani such 
thing but that it should be holi and without blemish 

5 28 so ought men to love their wife a their own bodi he that 
loveth hi wife loveth himself 

5 29 for no man ever yet hate hi own flesh but nourisheth and 
cherisheth it even a the lord the church 5 30 for we are member of 
hi bodi of hi flesh and of hi bone 

5 31 for thi cau shall a man leav hi father and mother and shall 
be join unto hi wife and they two shall be one flesh 

5 32 thi is a great mysteri but i speak concern christ and the 
church 

5 33 nevertheless let everi one of you in particular so love hi wife 
even a himself and the wife see that she rever her husband 

6 1 child obey your parent in the lord for thi is right 

6 2 honour thi father and mother which is the first command with 
promi 6 3 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long 
on the earth 

6 4 and ye father provok not your child to wrath but bring 
them up in the nurtur and admonit of the lord 

6 5 servant be obedi to them that are your master accord to 
the flesh with fear and trembl in singl of your heart a 
unto christ 6 6 not with eyeserv a menplea but a the 
servant of christ do the will of god from the heart 6 7 with 
good will do servic a to the lord and not to men 6 8 know 
that whatsoev good thing ani man doeth the same shall he receiv of 
the lord whether he be bond or free 

6 9 and ye master do the same thing unto them forbear 
threaten know that your master also is in heaven neither is 
there respect of person with him 

6 10 final my brother be strong in the lord and in the power of 
hi might 

6 11 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be abl to stand 
against the wile of the devil 

6 12 for we wrestl not against flesh and blood but against 
princip against power against the ruler of the dark of 
thi world against spiritu wick in high place 

6 13 wherefor take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be

meet for me to think thi of you all becau i have you in my heart 
inasmuch a both in my bond and in the defenc and confirm of 
the gospel ye all are partak of my grace 

1 8 for god is my record how greatli i long after you all in the 
bowel of jesu christ 

1 9 and thi i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in 
knowledg and in all judgment 1 10 that ye may approv thing that

of christ 

1 11 be fill with the fruit of righteou which are by jesu 
christ unto the glori and prai of god 

1 12 but i would ye should understand brother that the thing which 
happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the further of the 
gospel 1 13 so that my bond in christ are manifest in all the 
palac and in all other place 1 14 and mani of the brother in the 
lord wax confid by my bond are much more bold to speak the 
word without fear 

1 15 some ind preach christ even of envi and strife and some also 
of good will 1 16 the one preach christ of content not sincer 
suppo to add afflict to my bond 1 17 but the other of love 
know that i am set for the defenc of the gospel 

1 18 what then notwithstand everi way whether in pretenc or in 
truth christ is preach and i therein do rejoic yea and will 
rejoic 

1 19 for i know that thi shall turn to my salvat through your 
prayer and the suppli of the spirit of jesu christ 1 20 accord 
to my earnest expect and my hope that in noth i shall be 
asham but that with all bold a alway so now also christ 
shall be magnifi in my bodi whether it be by life or by death 

1 21 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain 

1 22 but if i live in the flesh thi is the fruit of my labour yet 
what i shall choo i wot not 

1 23 for i am in a strait betwixt two have a desir to depart and 
to be with christ which is far better 1 24 nevertheless to abid in 
the flesh is more need for you 

1 25 and have thi confid i know that i shall abid and 
continu with you all for your further and joy of faith 1 26 that 
your rejoic may be more abund in jesu christ for me by my

of your affair that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind 
strive togeth for the faith of the gospel 1 28 and in noth 
terrifi by your adversari which is to them an evid token of 
perdit but to you of salvat and that of god 

1 29 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not onli to 
believ on him but also to suffer for hi sake 1 30 have the same 
conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me 

2 1 if there be therefor ani consol in christ if ani comfort of 
love if ani fellowship of the spirit if ani bowel and merci 2 2 
fulfil ye my joy that ye be likemind have the same love be 
of one accord of one mind 

2 3 let noth be done through strife or vainglori but in lowli 
of mind let each esteem other better than themselv 

2 4 look not everi man on hi own thing but everi man also on the 
thing of other 

2 5 let thi mind be in you which wa also in christ jesu 2 6 who 
be in the form of god thought it not robberi to be equal with god 
2 7 but made himself of no reput and took upon him the form of a 
servant and wa made in the like of men 2 8 and be found in 
fashion a a man he humbl himself and becam obedi unto death 
even the death of the cross 

2 9 wherefor god also hath highli exalt him and given him a name 
which is abov everi name 2 10 that at the name of jesu everi knee 
should bow of thing in heaven and thing in earth and thing under 
the earth 2 11 and that everi tongu should confess that jesu christ 
is lord to the glori of god the father 

2 12 wherefor my belov a ye have alway obey not a in my 
presenc onli but now much more in my absenc work out your own 
salvat with fear and trembl 

2 13 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of hi 
good pleasur 

2 14 do all thing without murmur and disput 2 15 that ye may 
be blameless and harmless the son of god without rebuk in the 
midst of a crook and perver nation among whom ye shine a light 
in the world 2 16 hold forth the word of life that i may rejoic 
in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither labour in 
vain 

2 17 yea and if i be offer upon the sacrif and servic of your 
faith i joy and rejoic with you all 

2 18 for the same cau also do ye joy and rejoic with me 

2 19 but i trust in the lord jesu to send timotheu shortli unto you 
that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state 

2 20 for i have no man likemind who will natur care for your 
state 

2 21 for all seek their own not the thing which are jesu christ s 

2 22 but ye know the proof of him that a a son with the father he 
hath serv with me in the gospel 

2 23 him therefor i hope to send present so soon a i shall see 
how it will go with me 

2 24 but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortli 

2 25 yet i suppo it necessari to send to you epaphroditu my 
brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldi but your 
messeng and he that minist to my want 

2 26 for he long after you all and wa full of heavi becau 
that ye had heard that he had been sick 

2 27 for ind he wa sick nigh unto death but god had merci on him 
and not on him onli but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon 
sorrow 

2 28 i sent him therefor the more care that when ye see him 
again ye may rejoic and that i may be the le sorrow 

2 29 receiv him therefor in the lord with all glad and hold 
such in reput 2 30 becau for the work of christ he wa nigh 
unto death not regard hi life to suppli your lack of servic 
toward me 

3 1 final my brother rejoic in the lord to write the same 
thing to you to me ind is not grievou but for you it is safe 

3 2 bewar of dog bewar of evil worker bewar of the conci 

3 3 for we are the circumci which worship god in the spirit and 
rejoic in christ jesu and have no confid in the flesh 

3 4 though i might also have confid in the flesh if ani other man 
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more 3 5

benjamin an hebrew of the hebrew a touch the law a pharis 
3 6 concern zeal persecut the church touch the

3 8 yea doubtless and i count all thing but loss for the excel 
of the knowledg of christ jesu my lord for whom i have suffer the 
loss of all thing and do count them but dung that i may win christ 
3 9 and be found in him not have mine own righteou which is 
of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the 
righteou which is of god by faith 3 10 that i may know him and 
the power of hi resurrect and the fellowship of hi suffer 
be made conform unto hi death 3 11 if by ani mean i might 
attain unto the resurrect of the dead 

3 12 not a though i had alreadi attain either were alreadi 
perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which 
also i am apprehend of christ jesu 

3 13 brother i count not myself to have apprehend but thi one 
thing i do forget those thing which are behind and reach 
forth unto those thing which are befor 3 14 i press toward the mark

the first epistl of paul the apostl to timothi 


1 1 paul an apostl of jesu christ by the command of god our 
saviour and lord jesu christ which is our hope 1 2 unto timothi 
my own son in the faith grace merci and peac from god our father 
and jesu christ our lord 

1 3 a i besought thee to abid still at ephesu when i went into 
macedonia that thou mightest charg some that they teach no other 
doctrin 1 4 neither give heed to fabl and endless genealog 
which minist question rather than godli edifi which is in 
faith so do 

1 5 now the end of the command is chariti out of a pure heart and 
of a good conscienc and of faith unfeign 1 6 from which some 
have swerv have turn asid unto vain jangl 1 7 desir to 
be teacher of the law understand neither what they say nor 
whereof they affirm 

1 8 but we know that the law is good if a man use it law 1 9 
know thi that the law is not made for a righteou man but for 
the lawless and disobedi for the ungodli and for sinner for 
unholi and profan for murder of father and murder of mother 
for manslay 1 10 for whoremong for them that defil themselv 
with mankind for mensteal for liar for perjur person and if 
there be ani other thing that is contrari to sound doctrin 1 11 
accord to the gloriou gospel of the bless god which wa 
commit to my trust 

1 12 and i thank christ jesu our lord who hath enabl me for that 
he count me faith put me into the ministri 1 13 who wa 
befor a blasphem and a persecutor and injuri but i obtain 
merci becau i did it ignorantli in unbelief 

1 14 and the grace of our lord wa exceed abund with faith and 
love which is in christ jesu 

1 15 thi is a faith say and worthi of all accept that 
christ jesu came into the world to save sinner of whom i am chief 

1 16 howbeit for thi cau i obtain merci that in me first jesu 
christ might shew forth all longsuff for a pattern to them which 
should hereaft believ on him to life everlast 

1 17 now unto the king etern immort invi the onli wise 
god be honour and glori for ever and ever amen 

1 18 thi charg i commit unto thee son timothi accord to the 
propheci which went befor on thee that thou by them mightest war a 
good warfar 1 19 hold faith and a good conscienc which some 
have put away concern faith have made shipwreck 1 20 of whom is 
hymenaeu and alexand whom i have deliv unto satan that they 
may learn not to blasphem 

2 1 i exhort therefor that first of all supplic prayer 
intercess and give of thank be made for all men 2 2 for 
king and for all that are in author that we may lead a quiet and 
peaceabl life in all godli and honesti 

2 3 for thi is good and accept in the sight of god our saviour 
2 4 who will have all men to be save and to come unto the knowledg 
of the truth 

2 5 for there is one god and one mediat between god and men the 
man christ jesu 2 6 who gave himself a ransom for all to be 
testifi in due time 

2 7 whereunto i am ordain a preacher and an apostl i speak the 
truth in christ and lie not a teacher of the gentil in faith and 
veriti 

2 8 i will therefor that men pray everi where lift up holi hand 
without wrath and doubt 

2 9 in like manner also that woman adorn themselv in modest 
apparel with shamefac and sobrieti not with broid hair or 
gold or pearl or costli array 2 10 but which becometh woman 
profess godli with good work 

2 11 let the woman learn in silenc with all subject 

2 12 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp author over 
the man but to be in silenc 

2 13 for adam wa first form then eve 

2 14 and adam wa not deceiv but the woman be deceiv wa in 
the transgress 

2 15 notwithstand she shall be save in childbear if they 
continu in faith and chariti and holi with sobrieti 

3 1 thi is a true say if a man desir the offic of a bishop he 
desireth a good work 

3 2 a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife 
vigil sober of good behaviour given to hospit apt to 
teach 3 3 not given to wine no striker not greedi of filthi lucr 
but patient not a brawler not covet 3 4 one that ruleth well hi 
own hou have hi child in subject with all graviti 3 5 
for if a man know not how to rule hi own hou how shall he take 
care of the church of god 3 6 not a novic lest be lift up 
with pride he fall into the condemn of the devil 

3 7 moreov he must have a good report of them which are without 
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil 

3 8 likewi must the deacon be grave not doubletongu not given 
to much wine not greedi of filthi lucr 3 9 hold the mysteri of 
the faith in a pure conscienc 

3 10 and let these also first be prove then let them use the offic 
of a deacon be found blameless 

3 11 even so must their wife be grave not slander sober 
faith in all thing 

3 12 let the deacon be the husband of one wife rule their 
child and their own hou well 

3 13 for they that have use the offic of a deacon well purcha to 
themselv a good degr and great bold in the faith which is in 
christ jesu 

3 14 these thing write i unto thee hope to come unto thee shortli 
3 15 but if i tarri long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to 
behav thyself in the hou of god which is the church of the live 
god the pillar and ground of the truth 

3 16 and without controversi great is the mysteri of godli god 
wa manifest in the flesh justifi in the spirit seen of angel 
preach unto the gentil believ on in the world receiv up into 
glori 

4 1 now the spirit speaketh expressli that in the latter time some 
shall depart from the faith give heed to seduc spirit and 
doctrin of devil 4 2 speak lie in hypocrisi have their 
conscienc sear with a hot iron 4 3 forbid to marri and 
command to abstain from meat which god hath creat to be 
receiv with thanksgiv of them which believ and know the truth 

4 4 for everi creatur of god is good and noth to be refu if 
it be receiv with thanksgiv 4 5 for it is sanctifi by the word 
of god and prayer 

4 6 if thou put the brother in remembr of these thing thou 
shalt be a good minist of jesu christ nourish up in the word of 
faith and of good doctrin whereunto thou hast attain 

4 7 but refu profan and old wife fabl and exerci thyself 
rather unto godli 

4 8 for bodili exerci profiteth littl but godli is profit 
unto all thing have promi of the life that now is and of that 
which is to come 

4 9 thi is a faith say and worthi of all accept 

4 10 for therefor we both labour and suffer reproach becau we 
trust in the live god who is the saviour of all men special of 
those that believ 

4 11 these thing command and teach 

4 12 let no man despi thi youth but be thou an exampl of the 
believ in word in conver in chariti in spirit in faith 
in puriti 

4 13 till i come give attend to read to exhort to 
doctrin 

4 14 neglect not the gift that is in thee which wa given thee by 
propheci with the lay on of the hand of the presbyteri 

4 15 medit upon these thing give thyself wholli to them that thi 
profit may appear to all 

4 16 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrin continu in them 
for in do thi thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear 
thee 

5 1 rebuk not an elder but intreat him a a father and the younger 
men a brother 5 2 the elder woman a mother the younger a 
sister with all puriti 

5 3 honour widow that are widow ind 

5 4 but if ani widow have child or nephew let them learn first to 
shew pieti at home and to requit their parent for that is good and 
accept befor god 

5 5 now she that is a widow ind and desol trusteth in god and 
continueth in supplic and prayer night and day 

5 6 but she that liveth in pleasur is dead while she liveth 

5 7 and these thing give in charg that they may be blameless 

5 8 but if ani provid not for hi own and special for those of hi 
own hou he hath deni the faith and is wor than an infidel 

5 9 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescor year 
old have been the wife of one man 

5 10 well report of for good work if she have brought up child 
if she have lodg stranger if she have wash the saint foot if 
she have reliev the afflict if she have dilig follow everi 
good work 

5 11 but the younger widow refu for when they have begun to wax 
wanton against christ they will marri 5 12 have damnat becau 
they have cast off their first faith 

5 13 and withal they learn to be idl wander about from hou to 
hou and not onli idl but tattler also and busybodi speak 
thing which they ought not 

5 14 i will therefor that the younger woman marri bear child 
guid the hou give none occa to the adversari to speak 
reproach 

5 15 for some are alreadi turn asid after satan 

5 16 if ani man or woman that believeth have widow let them reliev 
them and let not the church be charg that it may reliev them that 
are widow ind 

5 17 let the elder that rule well be count worthi of doubl honour 
especi they who labour in the word and doctrin 

5 18 for the scriptur saith thou shalt not muzzl the ox that 
treadeth out the corn and the labour is worthi of hi reward 

5 19 against an elder receiv not an accu but befor two or 
three wit 

5 20 them that sin rebuk befor all that other also may fear 

5 21 i charg thee befor god and the lord jesu christ and the 
elect angel that thou observ these thing without prefer one 
befor anoth do noth by partial 

5 22 lay hand suddenli on no man neither be partak of other men s 
sin keep thyself pure 

5 23 drink no longer water but use a littl wine for thi stomach s 
sake and thine often infirm 

5 24 some men s sin are open beforehand go befor to judgment 
and some men they follow after 

5 25 likewi also the good work of some are manifest beforehand and 
they that are otherwi cannot be hid 

6 1 let a mani servant a are under the yoke count their own master 
worthi of all honour that the name of god and hi doctrin be not 
blasphem 

6 2 and they that have believ master let them not despi them 
becau they are brother but rather do them servic becau they 
are faith and belov partak of the benefit these thing teach 
and exhort 

6 3 if ani man teach otherwi and consent not to wholesom word 
even the word of our lord jesu christ and to the doctrin which is 
accord to godli 6 4 he is proud know noth but dote 
about question and strife of word whereof cometh envi strife 
rail evil surmi 6 5 perver disput of men of corrupt 
mind and destitut of the truth suppo that gain is godli 
from such withdraw thyself 

6 6 but godli with content is great gain 

6 7 for we brought noth into thi world and it is certain we can 
carri noth out 

6 8 and have food and raiment let u be therewith content 

6 9 but they that will be rich fall into temptat and a snare and 
into mani foolish and hurt lust which drown men in destruct 
and perdit 

6 10 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some 
covet after they have er from the faith and pierc themselv 
through with mani sorrow 

6 11 but thou o man of god flee these thing and follow after 
righteou godli faith love patienc meek

whereunto thou art also call and hast profess a good profess

the epistl of paul the apostl to the hebrew 


1 1 god who at sundri time and in diver manner spake in time past 
unto the father by the prophet 1 2 hath in these last day spoken 
unto u by hi son whom he hath appoint heir of all thing by whom 
also he made the world 1 3 who be the bright of hi glori 
and the express imag of hi person and uphold all thing by the 
word of hi power when he had by himself purg our sin sat down on 
the right hand of the majesti on high 1 4 be made so much better 
than the angel a he hath by inherit obtain a more excel 
name than they 

1 5 for unto which of the angel said he at ani time thou art my son 
thi day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father 
and he shall be to me a son 1 6 and again when he bringeth in the 
firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angel of god 
worship him 

1 7 and of the angel he saith who maketh hi angel spirit and hi 
minist a flame of fire 

1 8 but unto the son he saith thi throne o god is for ever and 
ever a sceptr of righteou is the sceptr of thi kingdom 

1 9 thou hast love righteou and hate iniqu therefor god 
even thi god hath anoint thee with the oil of glad abov thi 
fellow 

1 10 and thou lord in the begin hast laid the foundat of the 
earth and the heaven are the work of thine hand 1 11 they shall 
perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old a doth a 
garment 1 12 and a a vestur shalt thou fold them up and they shall 
be chang but thou art the same and thi year shall not fail 

1 13 but to which of the angel said he at ani time sit on my right 
hand until i make thine enemi thi footstool 1 14 are they not all 
minist spirit sent forth to minist for them who shall be 
heir of salvat 2 1 therefor we ought to give the more earnest 
heed to the thing which we have heard lest at ani time we should let 
them slip 

2 2 for if the word spoken by angel wa stedfast and everi 
transgress and disobedi receiv a just recomp of reward 
2 3 how shall we escap if we neglect so great salvat which at 
the first began to be spoken by the lord and wa confirm unto u by 
them that heard him 2 4 god also bear them wit both with 
sign and wonder and with diver miracl and gift of the holi 
ghost accord to hi own will 2 5 for unto the angel hath he not 
put in subject the world to come whereof we speak 

2 6 but one in a certain place testifi say what is man that 
thou art mind of him or the son of man that thou visitest him 
2 7 thou madest him a littl lower than the angel thou crownedst him 
with glori and honour and didst set him over the work of thi hand 
2 8 thou hast put all thing in subject under hi foot for in that 
he put all in subject under him he left noth that is not put 
under him 

but now we see not yet all thing put under him 

2 9 but we see jesu who wa made a littl lower than the angel for 
the suffer of death crown with glori and honour that he by the 
grace of god should tast death for everi man 

2 10 for it becam him for whom are all thing and by whom are all 
thing in bring mani son unto glori to make the captain of their 
salvat perfect through suffer 

2 11 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctifi are all 
of one for which cau he is not asham to call them brother 2 12 
say i will declar thi name unto my brother in the midst of the 
church will i sing prai unto thee 

2 13 and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and 
the child which god hath given me 

2 14 forasmuch then a the child are partak of flesh and blood 
he also himself likewi took part of the same that through death he 
might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil 
2 15 and deliv them who through fear of death were all their 
lifetim subject to bondag 

2 16 for verili he took not on him the natur of angel but he took 
on him the seed of abraham 

2 17 wherefor in all thing it behov him to be made like unto hi 
brother that he might be a merci and faith high priest in 
thing pertain to god to make reconcili for the sin of the 
peopl 

2 18 for in that he himself hath suffer be tempt he is abl to 
succour them that are tempt 

3 1 wherefor holi brother partak of the heavenli call 
consid the apostl and high priest of our profess christ jesu 
3 2 who wa faith to him that appoint him a also mose wa 
faith in all hi hou 

3 3 for thi man wa count worthi of more glori than mose inasmuch 
a he who hath build the hou hath more honour than the hou 

3 4 for everi hou is build by some man but he that built all 
thing is god 

3 5 and mose verili wa faith in all hi hou a a servant for 
a testimoni of those thing which were to be spoken after 3 6 but 
christ a a son over hi own hou whose hou are we if we hold 
fast the confid and the rejoic of the hope firm unto the end 

3 7 wherefor a the holi ghost saith to day if ye will hear hi 
voic 3 8 harden not your heart a in the provoc in the day 
of temptat in the wilder 3 9 when your father tempt me 
prove me and saw my work forti year 

3 10 wherefor i wa griev with that gener and said they do 
alway err in their heart and they have not known my way 

3 11 so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest 3 12 
take heed brother lest there be in ani of you an evil heart of 
unbelief in depart from the live god 

3 13 but exhort one anoth daili while it is call to day lest ani 
of you be harden through the deceit of sin 

3 14 for we are made partak of christ if we hold the begin of 
our confid stedfast unto the end 3 15 while it is said to day if 
ye will hear hi voic harden not your heart a in the provoc 

3 16 for some when they had heard did provok howbeit not all that 
came out of egypt by mose 

3 17 but with whom wa he griev forti year wa it not with them 
that had sin whose carca fell in the wilder 3 18 and to 
whom sware he that they should not enter into hi rest but to them 
that believ not 3 19 so we see that they could not enter in 
becau of unbelief 

4 1 let u therefor fear lest a promi be left u of enter 
into hi rest ani of you should seem to come short of it 

4 2 for unto u wa the gospel preach a well a unto them but the 
word preach did not profit them not be mix with faith in them 
that heard it 

4 3 for we which have believ do enter into rest a he said a i 
have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the 
work were finish from the foundat of the world 

4 4 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on thi wise 
and god did rest the seventh day from all hi work 

4 5 and in thi place again if they shall enter into my rest 

4 6 see therefor it remaineth that some must enter therein and 
they to whom it wa first preach enter not in becau of unbelief 
4 7 again he limiteth a certain day say in david to day after 
so long a time a it is said to day if ye will hear hi voic 
harden not your heart 

4 8 for if jesu had given them rest then would he not afterward have 
spoken of anoth day 

4 9 there remaineth therefor a rest to the peopl of god 

4 10 for he that is enter into hi rest he also hath cea from 
hi own work a god did from hi 

4 11 let u labour therefor to enter into that rest lest ani man 
fall after the same exampl of unbelief 

4 12 for the word of god is quick and power and sharper than ani 
twoedg sword pierc even to the divid asund of soul and 
spirit and of the joint and marrow and is a discern of the 
thought and intent of the heart 

4 13 neither is there ani creatur that is not manifest in hi sight 
but all thing are nake and open unto the eye of him with whom we 
have to do 

4 14 see then that we have a great high priest that is pa into 
the heaven jesu the son of god let u hold fast our profess 

4 15 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touch with the 
feel of our infirm but wa in all point tempt like a we 
are yet without sin 

4 16 let u therefor come boldli unto the throne of grace that we 
may obtain merci and find grace to help in time of need 

5 1 for everi high priest taken from among men is ordain for men in 
thing pertain to god that he may offer both gift and sacrif 
for sin 5 2 who can have compass on the ignor and on them 
that are out of the way for that he himself also is compass with 
infirm 

5 3 and by reason hereof he ought a for the peopl so also for 
himself to offer for sin 

5 4 and no man taketh thi honour unto himself but he that is call 
of god a wa aaron 

5 5 so also christ glorifi not himself to be made an high priest 
but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten 
thee 

5 6 a he saith also in anoth place thou art a priest for ever 
after the order of melchisedec 

5 7 who in the day of hi flesh when he had offer up prayer and 
supplic with strong cri and tear unto him that wa abl to 
save him from death and wa heard in that he fear 5 8 though he 
were a son yet learn he obedi by the thing which he suffer 
5 9 and be made perfect he becam the author of etern salvat 
unto all them that obey him 5 10 call of god an high priest after 
the order of melchisedec 

5 11 of whom we have mani thing to say and hard to be utter 
see ye are dull of hear 

5 12 for when for the time ye ought to be teacher ye have need that 
one teach you again which be the first principl of the oracl of 
god and are becom such a have need of milk and not of strong meat 

5 13 for everi one that useth milk is unskil in the word of 
righteou for he is a babe 

5 14 but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even 
those who by reason of use have their sen exerci to discern both 
good and evil 

6 1 therefor leav the principl of the doctrin of christ let u 
go on unto perfect not lay again the foundat of repent 
from dead work and of faith toward god 6 2 of the doctrin of 
baptism and of lay on of hand and of resurrect of the dead 
and of etern judgment 

6 3 and thi will we do if god permit 

6 4 for it is imposs for those who were onc enlighten and have 
tast of the heavenli gift and were made partak of the holi 
ghost 6 5 and have tast the good word of god and the power of the 
world to come 6 6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto 
repent see they crucifi to themselv the son of god afresh 
and put him to an open shame 

6 7 for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it 
and bringeth forth herb meet for them by whom it is dress 
receiveth bless from god 6 8 but that which beareth thorn and 
brier is reject and is nigh unto cur whose end is to be 
burn 

6 9 but belov we are persuad better thing of you and thing 
that accompani salvat though we thu speak 

6 10 for god is not unright to forget your work and labour of 
love which ye have shew toward hi name in that ye have minist 
to the saint and do minist 

6 11 and we desir that everi one of you do shew the same dilig to 
the full assur of hope unto the end 6 12 that ye be not sloth 
but follow of them who through faith and patienc inherit the 
promi 

6 13 for when god made promi to abraham becau he could swear by 
no greater he sware by himself 6 14 say sure bless i will 
bless thee and multipli i will multipli thee 

6 15 and so after he had patient endur he obtain the promi 

6 16 for men verili swear by the greater and an oath for confirm 
is to them an end of all strife 

6 17 wherein god will more abundantli to shew unto the heir of 
promi the immut of hi counsel confirm it by an oath 6 18 
that by two immut thing in which it wa imposs for god to 
lie we might have a strong consol who have fled for refug to 
lay hold upon the hope set befor u 6 19 which hope we have a an 
anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into 
that within the veil 6 20 whither the forerunn is for u enter 
even jesu made an high priest for ever after the order of 
melchisedec 

7 1 for thi melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god 
who met abraham return from the slaughter of the king and bless 
him 7 2 to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first be by 
interpret king of righteou and after that also king of 
salem which is king of peac 7 3 without father without mother 
without descent have neither begin of day nor end of life 
but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continu 

7 4 now consid how great thi man wa unto whom even the patriarch 
abraham gave the tenth of the spoil 

7 5 and verili they that are of the son of levi who receiv the 
offic of the priesthood have a command to take tith of the 
peopl accord to the law that is of their brother though they 
come out of the loin of abraham 7 6 but he whose descent is not 
count from them receiv tith of abraham and bless him that had 
the promi 

7 7 and without all contradict the le is bless of the better 

7 8 and here men that die receiv tith but there he receiveth them 
of whom it is wit that he liveth 

7 9 and a i may so say levi also who receiveth tith pay tith 
in abraham 

7 10 for he wa yet in the loin of hi father when melchisedec met 
him 

7 11 if therefor perfect were by the levit priesthood for 
under it the peopl receiv the law what further need wa there 
that anoth priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and 
not be call after the order of aaron 7 12 for the priesthood be 
chang there is made of necess a chang also of the law 

7 13 for he of whom these thing are spoken pertaineth to anoth 
tribe of which no man gave attend at the altar 

7 14 for it is evid that our lord sprang out of juda of which 
tribe mose spake noth concern priesthood 

7 15 and it is yet far more evid for that after the similitud of 
melchisedec there ariseth anoth priest 7 16 who is made not after 
the law of a carnal command but after the power of an endless 
life 

7 17 for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of 
melchisedec 

7 18 for there is verili a disannul of the command go 
befor for the weak and unprofit thereof 

7 19 for the law made noth perfect but the bring in of a better 
hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god 

7 20 and inasmuch a not without an oath he wa made priest 7 21 for 
those priest were made without an oath but thi with an oath by him 
that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a 
priest for ever after the order of melchisedec 7 22 by so much wa 
jesu made a sureti of a better testament 

7 23 and they truli were mani priest becau they were not suffer 
to continu by reason of death 7 24 but thi man becau he 
continueth ever hath an unchang priesthood 

7 25 wherefor he is abl also to save them to the uttermost that come 
unto god by him see he ever liveth to make intercess for them 

7 26 for such an high priest becam u who is holi harmless 
undefil separ from sinner and made higher than the heaven 
7 27 who needeth not daili a those high priest to offer up 
sacrif first for hi own sin and then for the peopl s for thi 
he did onc when he offer up himself 

7 28 for the law maketh men high priest which have infirm but the 
word of the oath which wa sinc the law maketh the son who is 
consecr for evermor 

8 1 now of the thing which we have spoken thi is the sum we have 
such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the 
majesti in the heaven 8 2 a minist of the sanctuari and of the 
true tabernacl which the lord pitch and not man 

8 3 for everi high priest is ordain to offer gift and sacrif 
wherefor it is of necess that thi man have somewhat also to 
offer 

8 4 for if he were on earth he should not be a priest see that 
there are priest that offer gift accord to the law 8 5 who serv 
unto the exampl and shadow of heavenli thing a mose wa 
admonish of god when he wa about to make the tabernacl for see 
saith he that thou make all thing accord to the pattern shew to 
thee in the mount 

8 6 but now hath he obtain a more excel ministri by how much 
also he is the mediat of a better coven which wa establish 
upon better promi 

8 7 for if that first coven had been faultless then should no 
place have been sought for the second 

8 8 for find fault with them he saith behold the day come 
saith the lord when i will make a new coven with the hou of 
israel and with the hou of judah 8 9 not accord to the coven 
that i made with their father in the day when i took them by the hand 
to lead them out of the land of egypt becau they continu not in 
my coven and i regard them not saith the lord 

8 10 for thi is the coven that i will make with the hou of 
israel after those day saith the lord i will put my law into their 
mind and write them in their heart and i will be to them a god and 
they shall be to me a peopl 8 11 and they shall not teach everi man 
hi neighbour and everi man hi brother say know the lord for 
all shall know me from the least to the greatest 

8 12 for i will be merci to their unright and their sin 
and their iniqu will i rememb no more 

8 13 in that he saith a new coven he hath made the first old now 
that which decayeth and waxeth old is readi to vanish away 

9 1 then verili the first coven had also ordin of divin 
servic and a worldli sanctuari 

9 2 for there wa a tabernacl made the first wherein wa the 
candlestick and the tabl and the shewbread which is call the 
sanctuari 

9 3 and after the second veil the tabernacl which is call the 
holiest of all 9 4 which had the golden censer and the ark of the 
coven overlaid round about with gold wherein wa the golden pot 
that had manna and aaron s rod that bud and the tabl of the 
coven 9 5 and over it the cherub of glori shadow the 
mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularli 

9 6 now when these thing were thu ordain the priest went alway 
into the first tabernacl accomplish the servic of god 

9 7 but into the second went the high priest alon onc everi year 
not without blood which he offer for himself and for the error of 
the peopl 9 8 the holi ghost thi signifi that the way into the 
holiest of all wa not yet made manifest while a the first 
tabernacl wa yet stand 9 9 which wa a figur for the time then 
present in which were offer both gift and sacrif that could 
not make him that did the servic perfect a pertain to the 
conscienc 9 10 which stood onli in meat and drink and diver 
wash and carnal ordin impo on them until the time of 
reform 

9 11 but christ be come an high priest of good thing to come by a 
greater and more perfect tabernacl not made with hand that is to 
say not of thi build 9 12 neither by the blood of goat and 
calf but by hi own blood he enter in onc into the holi place 
have obtain etern redempt for u 

9 13 for if the blood of bull and of goat and the ash of an 
heifer sprinkl the unclean sanctifieth to the purifi of the 
flesh 9 14 how much more shall the blood of christ who through the 
etern spirit offer himself without spot to god purg your 
conscienc from dead work to serv the live god 9 15 and for thi 
cau he is the mediat of the new testament that by mean of death 
for the redempt of the transgress that were under the first 
testament they which are call might receiv the promi of etern 
inherit 

9 16 for where a testament is there must also of necess be the 
death of the testat 

9 17 for a testament is of forc after men are dead otherwi it is 
of no strength at all while the testat liveth 

9 18 whereupon neither the first testament wa dedic without 
blood 

9 19 for when mose had spoken everi precept to all the peopl 
accord to the law he took the blood of calf and of goat with 
water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkl both the book and 
all the peopl 9 20 say thi is the blood of the testament which 
god hath enjoin unto you 

9 21 moreov he sprinkl with blood both the tabernacl and all the 
vessel of the ministri 

9 22 and almost all thing are by the law purg with blood and 
without shed of blood is no remiss 

9 23 it wa therefor necessari that the pattern of thing in the 
heaven should be purifi with these but the heavenli thing 
themselv with better sacrif than these 

9 24 for christ is not enter into the holi place made with hand 
which are the figur of the true but into heaven itself now to 
appear in the presenc of god for u 9 25 nor yet that he should 
offer himself often a the high priest entereth into the holi place 
everi year with blood of other 9 26 for then must he often have 
suffer sinc the foundat of the world but now onc in the end of 
the world hath he appear to put away sin by the sacrif of 
himself 

9 27 and a it is appoint unto men onc to die but after thi the 
judgment 9 28 so christ wa onc offer to bear the sin of mani 
and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time 
without sin unto salvat 

10 1 for the law have a shadow of good thing to come and not the 
veri imag of the thing can never with those sacrif which they 
offer year by year continu make the comer thereunto perfect 

10 2 for then would they not have cea to be offer becau that 
the worshipp onc purg should have had no more conscienc of 
sin 

10 3 but in those sacrif there is a remembr again made of sin 
everi year 

10 4 for it is not possibl that the blood of bull and of goat 
should take away sin 

10 5 wherefor when he cometh into the world he saith sacrif and 
offer thou wouldest not but a bodi hast thou prepar me 10 6 in 
burnt offer and sacrif for sin thou hast had no pleasur 

10 7 then said i lo i come in the volum of the book it is written 
of me to do thi will o god 

10 8 abov when he said sacrif and offer and burnt offer 
and offer for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasur 
therein which are offer by the law 10 9 then said he lo i come 
to do thi will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish 
the second 

10 10 by the which will we are sanctifi through the offer of the 
bodi of jesu christ onc for all 

10 11 and everi priest standeth daili minist and offer 
oftentim the same sacrif which can never take away sin 10 12 
but thi man after he had offer one sacrif for sin for ever 
sat down on the right hand of god 10 13 from henceforth expect 
till hi enemi be made hi footstool 

10 14 for by one offer he hath perfect for ever them that are 
sanctifi 

10 15 whereof the holi ghost also is a wit to u for after that 
he had said befor 10 16 thi is the coven that i will make with 
them after those day saith the lord i will put my law into their 
heart and in their mind will i write them 10 17 and their sin and 
iniqu will i rememb no more 

10 18 now where remiss of these is there is no more offer for 
sin 

10 19 have therefor brother bold to enter into the holiest 
by the blood of jesu 10 20 by a new and live way which he hath 
consecr for u through the veil that is to say hi flesh 10 21 
and have an high priest over the hou of god 10 22 let u draw 
near with a true heart in full assur of faith have our heart 
sprinkl from an evil conscienc and our bodi wash with pure 
water 

10 23 let u hold fast the profess of our faith without waver 
for he is faith that promi 10 24 and let u consid one 
anoth to provok unto love and to good work 10 25 not forsak 
the assembl of ourselv togeth a the manner of some is but 
exhort one anoth and so much the more a ye see the day 
approach 

10 26 for if we sin wil after that we have receiv the knowledg 
of the truth there remaineth no more sacrif for sin 10 27 but a 
certain fear look for of judgment and fieri indign which 
shall devour the adversari 

10 28 he that despi mose law die without merci under two or 
three wit 10 29 of how much sorer punish suppo ye shall 
he be thought worthi who hath trodden under foot the son of god and 
hath count the blood of the coven wherewith he wa sanctifi 
an unholi thing and hath done despit unto the spirit of grace 
10 30 for we know him that hath said vengeanc belongeth unto me i 
will recompen saith the lord and again the lord shall judg hi 
peopl 

10 31 it is a fear thing to fall into the hand of the live god 

10 32 but call to remembr the former day in which after ye were 
illumin ye endur a great fight of afflict 10 33 partli 
whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproach and afflict 
and partli whilst ye becam companion of them that were so use 

10 34 for ye had compass of me in my bond and took joy the 
spoil of your good know in yourselv that ye have in heaven a 
better and an endur substanc 

10 35 cast not away therefor your confid which hath great 
recomp of reward 

10 36 for ye have need of patienc that after ye have done the will 
of god ye might receiv the promi 

10 37 for yet a littl while and he that shall come will come and 
will not tarri 

10 38 now the just shall live by faith but if ani man draw back my 
soul shall have no pleasur in him 

10 39 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdit but of them 
that believ to the save of the soul 

11 1 now faith is the substanc of thing hope for the evid of 
thing not seen 

11 2 for by it the elder obtain a good report 

11 3 through faith we understand that the world were frame by the 
word of god so that thing which are seen were not made of thing 
which do appear 

11 4 by faith abel offer unto god a more excel sacrif than 
cain by which he obtain wit that he wa righteou god 
testifi of hi gift and by it he be dead yet speaketh 

11 5 by faith enoch wa translat that he should not see death and 
wa not found becau god had translat him for befor hi 
translat he had thi testimoni that he plea god 

11 6 but without faith it is imposs to plea him for he that 
cometh to god must believ that he is and that he is a reward of 
them that dilig seek him 

11 7 by faith noah be warn of god of thing not seen a yet 
move with fear prepar an ark to the save of hi hou by the 
which he condemn the world and becam heir of the righteou 
which is by faith 

11 8 by faith abraham when he wa call to go out into a place which 
he should after receiv for an inherit obey and he went out 
not know whither he went 

11 9 by faith he sojourn in the land of promi a in a strang 
countri dwell in tabernacl with isaac and jacob the heir with 
him of the same promi 11 10 for he look for a citi which hath 
foundat whose builder and maker is god 

11 11 through faith also sara herself receiv strength to conceiv 
seed and wa deliv of a child when she wa past age becau she 
judg him faith who had promi 

11 12 therefor sprang there even of one and him a good a dead so 
mani a the star of the sky in multitud and a the sand which is by 
the sea shore innum 

11 13 these all die in faith not have receiv the promi but 
have seen them afar off and were persuad of them and embrac 
them and confess that they were stranger and pilgrim on the 
earth 

11 14 for they that say such thing declar plainli that they seek a 
countri 

11 15 and truli if they had been mind of that countri from whenc 
they came out they might have had opportun to have return 

11 16 but now they desir a better countri that is an heavenli 
wherefor god is not asham to be call their god for he hath 
prepar for them a citi 

11 17 by faith abraham when he wa tri offer up isaac and he 
that had receiv the promi offer up hi onli begotten son 11 18 
of whom it wa said that in isaac shall thi seed be call 11 19 
account that god wa abl to rai him up even from the dead from 
whenc also he receiv him in a figur 

11 20 by faith isaac bless jacob and esau concern thing to come 

11 21 by faith jacob when he wa a die bless both the son of 
joseph and worship lean upon the top of hi staff 

11 22 by faith joseph when he die made mention of the depart of 
the child of israel and gave command concern hi bone 

11 23 by faith mose when he wa born wa hid three month of hi 
parent becau they saw he wa a proper child and they were not 
afraid of the king s command 

11 24 by faith mose when he wa come to year refu to be call 
the son of pharaoh s daughter 11 25 choo rather to suffer 
afflict with the peopl of god than to enjoy the pleasur of sin 
for a season 11 26 esteem the reproach of christ greater rich 
than the treasur in egypt for he had respect unto the recomp of 
the reward 

11 27 by faith he forsook egypt not fear the wrath of the king 
for he endur a see him who is invi 

11 28 through faith he kept the passov and the sprinkl of blood 
lest he that destroy the firstborn should touch them 

11 29 by faith they pa through the red sea a by dri land which 
the egyptian assay to do were drown 

11 30 by faith the wall of jericho fell down after they were 
compass about seven day 

11 31 by faith the harlot rahab perish not with them that believ 
not when she had receiv the spi with peac 

11 32 and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of 
gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephtha of david also 
and samuel and of the prophet 11 33 who through faith subdu 
kingdom wrought righteou obtain promi stop the mouth 
of lion 

11 34 quench the violenc of fire escap the edg of the sword 
out of weak were made strong wax valiant in fight turn to 
flight the armi of the alien 

11 35 woman receiv their dead rai to life again and other were 
tortur not accept deliv that they might obtain a better 
resurrect 11 36 and other had trial of cruel mock and 
scourg yea moreov of bond and imprison 11 37 they were 
stone they were sawn asund were tempt were slain with the 
sword they wander about in sheepskin and goatskin be 
destitut afflict torment 11 38 of whom the world wa not 
worthi they wander in desert and in mountain and in den and 
cave of the earth 

11 39 and these all have obtain a good report through faith 
receiv not the promi 11 40 god have provid some better thing 
for u that they without u should not be made perfect 

12 1 wherefor see we also are compass about with so great a 
cloud of wit let u lay asid everi weight and the sin which 
doth so easili beset u and let u run with patienc the race that is 
set befor u 12 2 look unto jesu the author and finish of our 
faith who for the joy that wa set befor him endur the cross 
despi the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne 
of god 

12 3 for consid him that endur such contradict of sinner 
against himself lest ye be weari and faint in your mind 

12 4 ye have not yet resist unto blood strive against sin 

12 5 and ye have forgotten the exhort which speaketh unto you a 
unto child my son despi not thou the chasten of the lord 
nor faint when thou art rebuk of him 12 6 for whom the lord loveth 
he chasteneth and scourgeth everi son whom he receiveth 

12 7 if ye endur chasten god dealeth with you a with son for 
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not 12 8 but if ye be 
without chasti whereof all are partak then are ye bastard 
and not son 

12 9 furthermor we have had father of our flesh which correct u 
and we gave them rever shall we not much rather be in subject 
unto the father of spirit and live 12 10 for they verili for a few 
day chasten u after their own pleasur but he for our profit 
that we might be partak of hi holi 

12 11 now no chasten for the present seemeth to be joyou but 
grievou nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceabl fruit of 
righteou unto them which are exerci therebi 

12 12 wherefor lift up the hand which hang down and the feebl 
knee 12 13 and make straight path for your foot lest that which is 
lame be turn out of the way but let it rather be heal 

12 14 follow peac with all men and holi without which no man 
shall see the lord 12 15 look dilig lest ani man fail of the 
grace of god lest ani root of bitter spring up troubl you 
and therebi mani be defil 12 16 lest there be ani fornic or 
profan person a esau who for one morsel of meat sold hi 
birthright 

12 17 for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherit the 
bless he wa reject for he found no place of repent though 
he sought it care with tear 

12 18 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touch and 
that burn with fire nor unto black and dark and tempest 
12 19 and the sound of a trumpet and the voic of word which voic 
they that heard intreat that the word should not be spoken to them 
ani more 12 20 for they could not endur that which wa command 
and if so much a a beast touch the mountain it shall be stone or 
thrust through with a dart 12 21 and so terribl wa the sight that 
mose said i exceedingli fear and quak 12 22 but ye are come unto 
mount sion and unto the citi of the live god the heavenli 
jerusalem and to an innum compani of angel 12 23 to the 
gener assembl and church of the firstborn which are written in 
heaven and to god the judg of all and to the spirit of just men 
made perfect 12 24 and to jesu the mediat of the new coven and 
to the blood of sprinkl that speaketh better thing than that of 
abel 

12 25 see that ye refu not him that speaketh for if they escap 
not who refu him that spake on earth much more shall not we 
escap if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven 12 26 
whose voic then shook the earth but now he hath promi say 
yet onc more i shake not the earth onli but also heaven 

12 27 and thi word yet onc more signifieth the remov of those 
thing that are shaken a of thing that are made that those thing 
which cannot be shaken may remain 

12 28 wherefor we receiv a kingdom which cannot be move let u 
have grace wherebi we may serv god accept with rever and 
godli fear 12 29 for our god is a consum fire 

13 1 let brotherli love continu 

13 2 be not forget to entertain stranger for therebi some have 
entertain angel unawar 

13 3 rememb them that are in bond a bound with them and them 
which suffer adver a be yourselv also in the bodi 

13 4 marriag is honour in all and the bed undefil but 
whoremong and adult god will judg 

13 5 let your conver be without covet and be content 
with such thing a ye have for he hath said i will never leav 
thee nor forsak thee 

13 6 so that we may boldli say the lord is my helper and i will not 
fear what man shall do unto me 

13 7 rememb them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto 
you the word of god whose faith follow consid the end of their 
conver 

13 8 jesu christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever 

13 9 be not carri about with diver and strang doctrin for it is 
a good thing that the heart be establish with grace not with meat 
which have not profit them that have been occupi therein 

13 10 we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serv 
the tabernacl 

13 11 for the bodi of those beast whose blood is brought into the 
sanctuari by the high priest for sin are burn without the camp 

13 12 wherefor jesu also that he might sanctifi the peopl with hi 
own blood suffer without the gate 

13 13 let u go forth therefor unto him without the camp bear hi 
reproach 

13 14 for here have we no continu citi but we seek one to come 

13 15 by him therefor let u offer the sacrif of prai to god 
continu that is the fruit of our lip give thank to hi name 

13 16 but to do good and to commun forget not for with such 
sacrif god is well plea 

13 17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselv 
for they watch for your soul a they that must give account that 
they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofit 
for you 

13 18 pray for u for we trust we have a good conscienc in all 
thing will to live honestli 

13 19 but i beseech you the rather to do thi that i may be restor 
to you the sooner 

13 20 now the god of peac that brought again from the dead our lord 
jesu that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the 
everlast coven 13 21 make you perfect in everi good work to do 
hi will work in you that which is wellplea in hi sight 
through jesu christ to whom be glori for ever and ever amen 

13 22 and i beseech you brother suffer the word of exhort for 
i have written a letter unto you in few word 

13 23 know ye that our brother timothi is set at liberti with whom 
if he come shortli i will see you 

13 24 salut all them that have the rule over you and all the saint 

they of itali salut you 

13 25 grace be with you all amen 




the gener epistl of jame 


1 1 jame a servant of god and of the lord jesu christ 
to the twelv tribe which are scatter abroad greet 

1 2 my brother count it all joy when ye fall into diver 
temptat 1 3 know thi that the tri of your faith worketh 
patienc 

1 4 but let patienc have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and 
entir want noth 

1 5 if ani of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all 
men liber and upbraideth not and it shall be given him 

1 6 but let him ask in faith noth waver for he that wavereth 
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss 

1 7 for let not that man think that he shall receiv ani thing of the 
lord 

1 8 a doubl mind man is unstabl in all hi way 

1 9 let the brother of low degr rejoic in that he is exalt 1 10 
but the rich in that he is made low becau a the flower of the 
grass he shall pa away 

1 11 for the sun is no sooner risen with a burn heat but it 
withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of 
the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in 
hi way 

1 12 bless is the man that endureth temptat for when he is 
tri he shall receiv the crown of life which the lord hath 
promi to them that love him 

1 13 let no man say when he is tempt i am tempt of god for god 
cannot be tempt with evil neither tempteth he ani man 1 14 but 
everi man is tempt when he is drawn away of hi own lust and 
entic 

1 15 then when lust hath conceiv it bringeth forth sin and sin 
when it is finish bringeth forth death 

1 16 do not err my belov brother 

1 17 everi good gift and everi perfect gift is from abov and cometh 
down from the father of light with whom is no variabl neither 
shadow of turn 

1 18 of hi own will begat he u with the word of truth that we 
should be a kind of firstfruit of hi creatur 

1 19 wherefor my belov brother let everi man be swift to hear 
slow to speak slow to wrath 1 20 for the wrath of man worketh not 
the righteou of god 

1 21 wherefor lay apart all filthi and superflu of 
naughti and receiv with meek the engraft word which is 
abl to save your soul 

1 22 but be ye doer of the word and not hearer onli deceiv your 
own self 

1 23 for if ani be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like 
unto a man behold hi natur face in a glass 1 24 for he 
beholdeth himself and goeth hi way and straightway forgetteth what 
manner of man he wa 

1 25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberti and continueth 
therein he be not a forget hearer but a doer of the work thi 
man shall be bless in hi deed 

1 26 if ani man among you seem to be religi and bridleth not hi 
tongu but deceiveth hi own heart thi man s religion is vain 

1 27 pure religion and undefil befor god and the father is thi to 
visit the fatherless and widow in their afflict and to keep 
himself unspot from the world 

2 1 my brother have not the faith of our lord jesu christ the lord 
of glori with respect of person 

2 2 for if there come unto your assembl a man with a gold ring in 
goodli apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment 2 3 
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay cloth and say unto 
him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou 
there or sit here under my footstool 2 4 are ye not then partial in 
yourselv and are becom judg of evil thought 2 5 hearken my 
belov brother hath not god chosen the poor of thi world rich in 
faith and heir of the kingdom which he hath promi to them that 
love him 2 6 but ye have despi the poor do not rich men oppress 
you and draw you befor the judgment seat 2 7 do not they 
blasphem that worthi name by the which ye are call 2 8 if ye 
fulfil the royal law accord to the scriptur thou shalt love thi 
neighbour a thyself ye do well 2 9 but if ye have respect to 
person ye commit sin and are convinc of the law a transgressor 

2 10 for whosoev shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one 
point he is guilti of all 

2 11 for he that said do not commit adulteri said also do not kill 
now if thou commit no adulteri yet if thou kill thou art becom a 
transgressor of the law 

2 12 so speak ye and so do a they that shall be judg by the law 
of liberti 

2 13 for he shall have judgment without merci that hath shew no 
merci and merci rejoiceth against judgment 

2 14 what doth it profit my brother though a man say he hath faith 
and have not work can faith save him 2 15 if a brother or sister 
be nake and destitut of daili food 2 16 and one of you say unto 
them depart in peac be ye warm and fill notwithstand ye 
give them not those thing which are need to the bodi what doth it 
profit 2 17 even so faith if it hath not work is dead be 
alon 

2 18 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have work shew me 
thi faith without thi work and i will shew thee my faith by my 
work 

2 19 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devil 
also believ and trembl 

2 20 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without work is dead 
2 21 wa not abraham our father justifi by work when he had 
offer isaac hi son upon the altar 2 22 seest thou how faith 
wrought with hi work and by work wa faith made perfect 2 23 and 
the scriptur wa fulfil which saith abraham believ god and it 
wa imput unto him for righteou and he wa call the friend 
of god 

2 24 ye see then how that by work a man is justifi and not by 
faith onli 

2 25 likewi also wa not rahab the harlot justifi by work when 
she had receiv the messeng and had sent them out anoth way 
2 26 for a the bodi without the spirit is dead so faith without 
work is dead also 

3 1 my brother be not mani master know that we shall receiv 
the greater condemn 

3 2 for in mani thing we offend all if ani man offend not in word 
the same is a perfect man and abl also to bridl the whole bodi 

3 3 behold we put bit in the hor mouth that they may obey u 
and we turn about their whole bodi 

3 4 behold also the ship which though they be so great and are 
driven of fierc wind yet are they turn about with a veri small 
helm whithersoev the governor listeth 

3 5 even so the tongu is a littl member and boasteth great thing 

behold how great a matter a littl fire kindleth 3 6 and the tongu 
is a fire a world of iniqu so is the tongu among our member 
that it defileth the whole bodi and setteth on fire the cour of 
natur and it is set on fire of hell 

3 7 for everi kind of beast and of bird and of serpent and of 
thing in the sea is tame and hath been tame of mankind 3 8 but 
the tongu can no man tame it is an unruli evil full of deadli 
poison 

3 9 therewith bless we god even the father and therewith cur we 
men which are made after the similitud of god 

3 10 out of the same mouth proceedeth bless and cur my 
brother these thing ought not so to be 

3 11 doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and 
bitter 3 12 can the fig tree my brother bear oliv berri 
either a vine fig so can no fountain both yield salt water and 
fresh 

3 13 who is a wise man and endu with knowledg among you let him 
shew out of a good conver hi work with meek of wisdom 

3 14 but if ye have bitter envi and strife in your heart glori 
not and lie not against the truth 

3 15 thi wisdom descendeth not from abov but is earthli sensual 
devilish 

3 16 for where envi and strife is there is confu and everi 
evil work 

3 17 but the wisdom that is from abov is first pure then peaceabl 
gentl and easi to be intreat full of merci and good fruit 
without partial and without hypocrisi

it upon your lust 

4 4 ye adult and adulteress know ye not that the friendship of 
the world is enmiti with god whosoev therefor will be a friend of 
the world is the enemi of god 

4 5 do ye think that the scriptur saith in vain the spirit that 
dwelleth in u lusteth to envi 4 6 but he giveth more grace 
wherefor he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the 
humbl 

4 7 submit yourselv therefor to god resist the devil and he will 
flee from you 

4 8 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you clean your

1 24 for all flesh is a grass and all the glori of man a the flower 
of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away 
1 25 but the word of the lord endureth for ever and thi is the word 
which by the gospel is preach unto you 

2 1 wherefor lay asid all malic and all guil and hypocrisi 
and envi all evil speak 2 2 a newborn babe desir the 
sincer milk of the word that ye may grow therebi 2 3 if so be ye 
have tast that the lord is graciou

but chosen of god and preciou 2 5 ye also a live stone are 
built up a spiritu hou an holi priesthood to offer up spiritu 
sacrif accept to god by jesu christ 

2 6 wherefor also it is contain in the scriptur behold i lay in 
sion a chief corner stone elect preciou and he that believeth on

2 7 unto you therefor which believ he is preciou but unto them 
which be disobedi the stone which the builder disallow the 
same is made the head of the corner 2 8 and a stone of stumbl and 
a rock of offenc even to them which stumbl at the word be 
disobedi whereunto also they were appoint 

2 9 but ye are a chosen gener a royal priesthood an holi 
nation a peculiar peopl that ye should shew forth the prai of 
him who hath call you out of dark into hi marvel light 
2 10 which in time past were not a peopl but are now the peopl of 
god which had not obtain merci but now have obtain merci 

2 11 dearli belov i beseech you a stranger and pilgrim abstain 
from fleshli lust which war against the soul 2 12 have your 
conver honest among the gentil that wherea they speak 
against you a evildo they may by your good work which they 
shall behold glorifi god in the day of visit 

2 13 submit yourselv to everi ordin of man for the lord s sake 
whether it be to the king a suprem 2 14 or unto governor a unto 
them that are sent by him for the punish of evildo and for the 
prai of them that do well 

2 15 for so is the will of god that with well do ye may put to 
silenc the ignor of foolish men 2 16 a free and not use your 
liberti for a cloke of malici but a the servant of god 

2 17 honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king 

2 18 servant be subject to your master with all fear not onli to 
the good and gentl but also to the froward 

2 19 for thi is thankworthi if a man for conscienc toward god 
endur grief suffer wrong 

2 20 for what glori is it if when ye be buffet for your fault ye 
shall take it patient but if when ye do well and suffer for it 
ye take it patient thi is accept with god 

2 21 for even hereunto were ye call becau christ also suffer 
for u leav u an exampl that ye should follow hi step 2 22 
who did no sin neither wa guil found in hi mouth 2 23 who when 
he wa revil revil not again when he suffer he threaten 
not but commit himself to him that judgeth righteou 2 24 who 
hi own self bare our sin in hi own bodi on the tree that we be 
dead to sin should live unto righteou by whose stripe ye were 
heal 

2 25 for ye were a sheep go astray but are now return unto the 
shepherd and bishop of your soul 

3 1 likewi ye wife be in subject to your own husband that 
if ani obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the 
conver of the wife 3 2 while they behold your chast 
conver coupl with fear 

3 3 whose adorn let it not be that outward adorn of plait the 
hair and of wear of gold or of put on of apparel 3 4 but let 
it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corrupt 
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of 
god of great price 

3 5 for after thi manner in the old time the holi woman also who 
trust in god adorn themselv be in subject unto their own 
husband 3 6 even a sara obey abraham call him lord whose 
daughter ye are a long a ye do well and are not afraid with ani 
amaz 

3 7 likewi ye husband dwell with them accord to knowledg 
give honour unto the wife a unto the weaker vessel and a be 
heir togeth of the grace of life that your prayer be not 
hinder 

3 8 final be ye all of one mind have compass one of anoth 
love a brother be piti be courteou 3 9 not render evil for 
evil or rail for rail but contrariwi bless know that 
ye are thereunto call that ye should inherit a bless 

3 10 for he that will love life and see good day let him refrain 
hi tongu from evil and hi lip that they speak no guil 3 11 let 
him eschew evil and do good let him seek peac and ensu it 

3 12 for the eye of the lord are over the righteou and hi ear are 
open unto their prayer but the face of the lord is against them that 
do evil 

3 13 and who is he that will harm you if ye be follow of that 
which is good 3 14 but and if ye suffer for righteou sake 
happi are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubl 
3 15 but sanctifi the lord god in your heart and be readi alway to 
give an answer to everi man that asketh you a reason of the hope that 
is in you with meek and fear 3 16 have a good conscienc that 
wherea they speak evil of you a of evildo they may be asham 
that fal accu your good conver in christ 

3 17 for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for 
well do than for evil do 

3 18 for christ also hath onc suffer for sin the just for the 
unjust that he might bring u to god be put to death in the 
flesh but quicken by the spirit 3 19 by which also he went and 
preach unto the spirit in prison 3 20 which sometim were 
disobedi when onc the longsuff of god wait in the day of 
noah while the ark wa a prepar wherein few that is eight soul 
were save by water 

3 21 the like figur whereunto even baptism doth also now save u not 
the put away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good 
conscienc toward god by the resurrect of jesu christ 3 22 who 
is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angel and 
author and power be made subject unto him 

4 1 forasmuch then a christ hath suffer for u in the flesh arm 
yourselv likewi with the same mind for he that hath suffer in 
the flesh hath cea from sin 4 2 that he no longer should live the 
rest of hi time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of 
god 

4 3 for the time past of our life may suffic u to have wrought the 
will of the gentil when we walk in lascivi lust excess 
of wine revel banquet and abomin idolatri 4 4 
wherein they think it strang that ye run not with them to the same 
excess of riot speak evil of you 4 5 who shall give account to 
him that is readi to judg the quick and the dead 

4 6 for for thi cau wa the gospel preach also to them that are 
dead that they might be judg accord to men in the flesh but 
live accord to god in the spirit 

4 7 but the end of all thing is at hand be ye therefor sober and 
watch unto prayer 

4 8 and abov all thing have fervent chariti among yourselv for 
chariti shall cover the multitud of sin 

4 9 use hospit one to anoth without grudg 

4 10 a everi man hath receiv the gift even so minist the same 
one to anoth a good steward of the manifold grace of god 

4 11 if ani man speak let him speak a the oracl of god if ani man 
minist let him do it a of the abil which god giveth that god 
in all thing may be glorifi through jesu christ to whom be prai 
and dominion for ever and ever amen 

4 12 belov think it not strang concern the fieri trial which is 
to tri you a though some strang thing happen unto you 4 13 but 
rejoic inasmuch a ye are partak of christ s suffer that 
when hi glori shall be reveal ye may be glad also with exceed 
joy 

4 14 if ye be reproach for the name of christ happi are ye for the 
spirit of glori and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil 
spoken of but on your part he is glorifi 

4 15 but let none of you suffer a a murder or a a thief or a an 
evildo or a a busybodi in other men s matter 

4 16 yet if ani man suffer a a christian let him not be asham but 
let him glorifi god on thi behalf 

4 17 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the hou of 
god and if it first begin at u what shall the end be of them that 
obey not the gospel of god 4 18 and if the righteou scarc be 
save where shall the ungodli and the sinner appear 4 19 wherefor 
let them that suffer accord to the will of god commit the keep 
of their soul to him in well do a unto a faith creator 

5 1 the elder which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and 
a wit of the suffer of christ and also a partak of the 
glori that shall be reveal 5 2 feed the flock of god which is among 
you take the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingli 
not for filthi lucr but of a readi mind 5 3 neither a be lord 
over god s heritag but be ensampl to the flock 

5 4 and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receiv a crown 
of glori that fadeth not away 

5 5 likewi ye younger submit yourselv unto the elder yea all 
of you be subject one to anoth and be cloth with humil for 
god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humbl 

5 6 humbl yourselv therefor under the mighti hand of god that he 
may exalt you in due time 5 7 cast all your care upon him for he 
careth for you 

5 8 be sober be vigil becau your adversari the devil a a 
roar lion walketh about seek whom he may devour 5 9 whom

the second gener epistl of peter 


1 1 simon peter a servant and an apostl of jesu christ to them 
that have obtain like preciou faith with u through the 
righteou of god and our saviour jesu christ 1 2 grace and peac 
be multipli unto you through the knowledg of god and of jesu our 
lord 1 3 accord a hi divin power hath given unto u all thing 
that pertain unto life and godli through the knowledg of him 
that hath call u to glori and virtu 1 4 wherebi are given unto u 
exceed great and preciou promi that by these ye might be 
partak of the divin natur have escap the corrupt that is 
in the world through lust 

1 5 and besid thi give all dilig add to your faith virtu 
and to virtu knowledg 1 6 and to knowledg temper and to 
temper patienc and to patienc godli 1 7 and to godli 
brotherli kind and to brotherli kind chariti 

1 8 for if these thing be in you and abound they make you that ye 
shall neither be barren nor unfruit in the knowledg of our lord 
jesu christ 

1 9 but he that lacketh these thing is blind and cannot see afar 
off and hath forgotten that he wa purg from hi old sin 

1 10 wherefor the rather brother give dilig to make your 
call and elect sure for if ye do these thing ye shall never 
fall 1 11 for so an entranc shall be minist unto you abundantli 
into the everlast kingdom of our lord and saviour jesu christ 

1 12 wherefor i will not be neglig to put you alway in 
remembr of these thing though ye know them and be establish 
in the present truth 

1 13 yea i think it meet a long a i am in thi tabernacl to stir 
you up by put you in remembr 1 14 know that shortli i must 
put off thi my tabernacl even a our lord jesu christ hath shew 
me 

1 15 moreov i will endeavour that ye may be abl after my decea to 
have these thing alway in remembr 

1 16 for we have not follow cunningli devi fabl when we made 
known unto you the power and come of our lord jesu christ but were 
eyewit of hi majesti 

1 17 for he receiv from god the father honour and glori when there 
came such a voic to him from the excel glori thi is my belov 
son in whom i am well plea 

1 18 and thi voic which came from heaven we heard when we were with 
him in the holi mount 

1 19 we have also a more sure word of propheci whereunto ye do well 
that ye take heed a unto a light that shineth in a dark place until 
the day dawn and the day star ari in your heart 1 20 know thi 
first that no propheci of the scriptur is of ani privat 
interpret 

1 21 for the propheci came not in old time by the will of man but 
holi men of god spake a they were move by the holi ghost 

2 1 but there were fal prophet also among the peopl even a there 
shall be fal teacher among you who privili shall bring in damnabl 
heresi even deni the lord that bought them and bring upon 
themselv swift destruct 

2 2 and mani shall follow their pernici way by reason of whom the 
way of truth shall be evil spoken of 

2 3 and through covet shall they with feign word make 
merchandi of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not 
and their damnat slumbereth not 

2 4 for if god spare not the angel that sin but cast them down 
to hell and deliv them into chain of dark to be reserv 
unto judgment 2 5 and spare not the old world but save noah the 
eighth person a preacher of righteou bring in the flood upon 
the world of the ungodli 2 6 and turn the citi of sodom and 
gomorrha into ash condemn them with an overthrow make them an 
ensampl unto those that after should live ungodli 2 7 and deliv 
just lot vex with the filthi conver of the wick 2 8 for 
that righteou man dwell among them in see and hear vex 
hi righteou soul from day to day with their unlaw deed 2 9 the 
lord knoweth how to deliv the godli out of temptat and to 
reserv the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punish 2 10 but 
chiefli them that walk after the flesh in the lust of unclean and 
despi govern presumptu are they selfwil they are not 
afraid to speak evil of digniti 

2 11 wherea angel which are greater in power and might bring not 
rail accu against them befor the lord 

2 12 but these a natur brute beast made to be taken and 
destroy speak evil of the thing that they understand not and 
shall utterli perish in their own corrupt 2 13 and shall receiv 
the reward of unright a they that count it pleasur to riot 
in the day time spot they are and blemish sport themselv 
with their own deceiv while they feast with you 2 14 have eye 
full of adulteri and that cannot cea from sin beguil unstabl 
soul an heart they have exerci with covet practic cur 
child 2 15 which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray 
follow the way of balaam the son of bosor who love the wage of 
unright 2 16 but wa rebuk for hi iniqu the dumb a 
speak with man s voic forbad the mad of the prophet 

2 17 these are well without water cloud that are carri with a 
tempest to whom the mist of dark is reserv for ever 

2 18 for when they speak great swell word of vaniti they allur 
through the lust of the flesh through much wanton those that 
were clean escap from them who live in error 

2 19 while they promi them liberti they themselv are the servant 
of corrupt for of whom a man is overcom of the same is he 
brought in bondag 

2 20 for if after they have escap the pollut of the world 
through the knowledg of the lord and saviour jesu christ they are 
again entangl therein and overcom the latter end is wor with 
them than the begin 

2 21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of 
righteou than after they have known it to turn from the holi 
command deliv unto them 

2 22 but it is happen unto them accord to the true proverb the 
dog is turn to hi own vomit again and the sow that wa wash to 
her wallow in the mire 

3 1 thi second epistl belov i now write unto you in both which 
i stir up your pure mind by way of remembr 3 2 that ye may be 
mind of the word which were spoken befor by the holi prophet 
and of the command of u the apostl of the lord and saviour 3 3 
know thi first that there shall come in the last day scoffer 
walk after their own lust 3 4 and say where is the promi of 
hi come for sinc the father fell asleep all thing continu a

handl of the word of life 1 2 for the life wa manifest and we 
have seen it and bear wit and shew unto you that etern life 
which wa with the father and wa manifest unto u 1 3 that which 
we have seen and heard declar we unto you that ye also may have 
fellowship with u and truli our fellowship is with the father and 
with hi son jesu christ 

1 4 and these thing write we unto you that your joy may be full 

1 5 thi then is the messag which we have heard of him and declar 
unto you that god is light and in him is no dark at all 

1 6 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in dark 
we lie and do not the truth 1 7 but if we walk in the light a he 
is in the light we have fellowship one with anoth and the blood of 
jesu christ hi son cleanseth u from all sin 

1 8 if we say that we have no sin we deceiv ourselv and the truth 
is not in u 

1 9 if we confess our sin he is faith and just to forgiv u our 
sin and to clean u from all unright 

1 10 if we say that we have not sin we make him a liar and hi 
word is not in u 

2 1 my littl child these thing write i unto you that ye sin 
not 

and if ani man sin we have an advoc with the father jesu christ 
the righteou 2 2 and he is the propiti for our sin and not 
for our s onli but also for the sin of the whole world 

2 3 and herebi we do know that we know him if we keep hi 
command 

2 4 he that saith i know him and keepeth not hi command is a 
liar and the truth is not in him 

2 5 but whoso keepeth hi word in him verili is the love of god 
perfect herebi know we that we are in him 

2 6 he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk 
even a he walk 

2 7 brother i write no new command unto you but an old 
command which ye had from the begin the old command is 
the word which ye have heard from the begin 

2 8 again a new command i write unto you which thing is true in 
him and in you becau the dark is past and the true light now 
shineth 

2 9 he that saith he is in the light and hateth hi brother is in 
dark even until now 

2 10 he that loveth hi brother abideth in the light and there is 
none occa of stumbl in him 

2 11 but he that hateth hi brother is in dark and walketh in 
dark and knoweth not whither he goeth becau that dark hath 
blind hi eye 

2 12 i write unto you littl child becau your sin are forgiven 
you for hi name s sake 

2 13 i write unto you father becau ye have known him that is from 
the begin i write unto you young men becau ye have overcom 
the wick one i write unto you littl child becau ye have 
known the father 

2 14 i have written unto you father becau ye have known him that 
is from the begin i have written unto you young men becau ye 
are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcom 
the wick one 

2 15 love not the world neither the thing that are in the world if 
ani man love the world the love of the father is not in him 

2 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust 
of the eye and the pride of life is not of the father but is of 
the world 

2 17 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that 
doeth the will of god abideth for ever 

2 18 littl child it is the last time and a ye have heard that 
antichrist shall come even now are there mani antichrist wherebi we 
know that it is the last time 

2 19 they went out from u but they were not of u for if they had 
been of u they would no doubt have continu with u but they went 
out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of u 

2 20 but ye have an unction from the holi one and ye know all thing 

2 21 i have not written unto you becau ye know not the truth but 
becau ye know it and that no lie is of the truth 

2 22 who is a liar but he that denieth that jesu is the christ he is 
antichrist that denieth the father and the son 

2 23 whosoev denieth the son the same hath not the father he that 
acknowledgeth the son hath the father also 

2 24 let that therefor abid in you which ye have heard from the 
begin if that which ye have heard from the begin shall remain 
in you ye also shall continu in the son and in the father 

2 25 and thi is the promi that he hath promi u even etern 
life 

2 26 these thing have i written unto you concern them that seduc 
you 

2 27 but the anoint which ye have receiv of him abideth in you 
and ye need not that ani man teach you but a the same anoint 
teacheth you of all thing and is truth and is no lie and even a 
it hath taught you ye shall abid in him 

2 28 and now littl child abid in him that when he shall 
appear we may have confid and not be asham befor him at hi 
come 

2 29 if ye know that he is righteou ye know that everi one that 
doeth righteou is born of him 

3 1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestow upon u that 
we should be call the son of god therefor the world knoweth u 
not becau it knew him not 

3 2 belov now are we the son of god and it doth not yet appear 
what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be 
like him for we shall see him a he is 

3 3 and everi man that hath thi hope in him purifieth himself even 
a he is pure 

3 4 whosoev committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is 
the transgress of the law 

3 5 and ye know that he wa manifest to take away our sin and in 
him is no sin 

3 6 whosoev abideth in him sinneth not whosoev sinneth hath not 
seen him neither known him 

3 7 littl child let no man deceiv you he that doeth 
righteou is righteou even a he is righteou 

3 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from 
the begin for thi purpo the son of god wa manifest that he 
might destroy the work of the devil 

3 9 whosoev is born of god doth not commit sin for hi seed 
remaineth in him and he cannot sin becau he is born of god 

3 10 in thi the child of god are manifest and the child of the 
devil whosoev doeth not righteou is not of god neither he 
that loveth not hi brother 

3 11 for thi is the messag that ye heard from the begin that we 
should love one anoth 

3 12 not a cain who wa of that wick one and slew hi brother 
and wherefor slew he him becau hi own work were evil and hi 
brother s righteou 

3 13 marvel not my brother if the world hate you 

3 14 we know that we have pa from death unto life becau we love 
the brother he that loveth not hi brother abideth in death 

3 15 whosoev hateth hi brother is a murder and ye know that no 
murder hath etern life abid in him 

3 16 herebi perceiv we the love of god becau he laid down hi life 
for u and we ought to lay down our life for the brother 

3 17 but whoso hath thi world s good and seeth hi brother have 
need and shutteth up hi bowel of compass from him how dwelleth 
the love of god in him 3 18 my littl child let u not love in 
word neither in tongu but in deed and in truth 

3 19 and herebi we know that we are of the truth and shall assur our 
heart befor him 

3 20 for if our heart condemn u god is greater than our heart and 
knoweth all thing 

3 21 belov if our heart condemn u not then have we confid 
toward god 

3 22 and whatsoev we ask we receiv of him becau we keep hi 
command and do those thing that are plea in hi sight 

3 23 and thi is hi command that we should believ on the name 
of hi son jesu christ and love one anoth a he gave u 
command 

3 24 and he that keepeth hi command dwelleth in him and he in 
him 

and herebi we know that he abideth in u by the spirit which he hath 
given u 

4 1 belov believ not everi spirit but tri the spirit whether 
they are of god becau mani fal prophet are gone out into the 
world 

4 2 herebi know ye the spirit of god everi spirit that confesseth 
that jesu christ is come in the flesh is of god 4 3 and everi spirit 
that confesseth not that jesu christ is come in the flesh is not of 
god and thi is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that 
it should come and even now alreadi is it in the world 

4 4 ye are of god littl child and have overcom them becau 
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world 

4 5 they are of the world therefor speak they of the world and the 
world heareth them 

4 6 we are of god he that knoweth god heareth u he that is not of 
god heareth not u herebi know we the spirit of truth and the spirit 
of error 

4 7 belov let u love one anoth for love is of god and everi 
one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god 

4 8 he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love 

4 9 in thi wa manifest the love of god toward u becau that god 
sent hi onli begotten son into the world that we might live through 
him 

4 10 herein is love not that we love god but that he love u and 
sent hi son to be the propiti for our sin 

4 11 belov if god so love u we ought also to love one anoth 

4 12 no man hath seen god at ani time if we love one anoth god 
dwelleth in u and hi love is perfect in u 

4 13 herebi know we that we dwell in him and he in u becau he 
hath given u of hi spirit 

4 14 and we have seen and do testifi that the father sent the son to 
be the saviour of the world 

4 15 whosoev shall confess that jesu is the son of god god 
dwelleth in him and he in god 

4 16 and we have known and believ the love that god hath to u god 
is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him 

4 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have bold in the 
day of judgment becau a he is so are we in thi world 

4 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear 
becau fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in 
love 

4 19 we love him becau he first love u 

4 20 if a man say i love god and hateth hi brother he is a liar 
for he that loveth not hi brother whom he hath seen how can he love 
god whom he hath not seen 4 21 and thi command have we from 
him that he who loveth god love hi brother also 

5 1 whosoev believeth that jesu is the christ is born of god and 
everi one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten 
of him 

5 2 by thi we know that we love the child of god when we love 
god and keep hi command 

5 3 for thi is the love of god that we keep hi command and 
hi command are not grievou 

5 4 for whatsoev is born of god overcometh the world and thi is 
the victori that overcometh the world even our faith 

5 5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that 
jesu is the son of god 5 6 thi is he that came by water and blood 
even jesu christ not by water onli but by water and blood and it 
is the spirit that beareth wit becau the spirit is truth 

5 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the 
word and the holi ghost and these three are one 

5 8 and there are three that bear wit in earth the spirit and 
the water and the blood and these three agr in one 

5 9 if we receiv the wit of men the wit of god is greater 
for thi is the wit of god which he hath testifi of hi son 

5 10 he that believeth on the son of god hath the wit in himself 
he that believeth not god hath made him a liar becau he believeth 
not the record that god gave of hi son 

5 11 and thi is the record that god hath given to u etern life 
and thi life is in hi son 

5 12 he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of 
god hath not life 

5 13 these thing have i written unto you that believ on the name of 
the son of god that ye may know that ye have etern life and that 
ye may believ on the name of the son of god 

5 14 and thi is the confid that we have in him that if we ask 
ani thing accord to hi will he heareth u 5 15 and if we know 
that he hear u whatsoev we ask we know that we have the petit 
that we desir of him 

5 16 if ani man see hi brother sin a sin which is not unto death he 
shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto 
death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for 
it 

5 17 all unright is sin and there is a sin not unto death 

5 18 we know that whosoev is born of god sinneth not but he that is 
begotten of god keepeth himself and that wick one toucheth him not 

5 19 and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in 
wick 

5 20 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given u an 
understand that we may know him that is true and we are in him 
that is true even in hi son jesu christ thi is the true god and 
etern life 

5 21 littl child keep yourselv from idol amen

corrupt themselv 

1 11 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran 
greedili after the error of balaam for reward and perish in the
