introduct and analysi 

the republ of plato is the longest of hi work with the except 
of the law and is certainli the greatest of them there are nearer 
approach to modern metaphi in the philebu and in the sophist the 
politicu or statesman is more ideal the form and institut of 
the state are more clearli drawn out in the law a work of art the 
symposium and the protagora are of higher excel but no other 
dialogu of plato ha the same larg of view and the same perfect 
of style no other show an equal knowledg of the world or contain 
more of those thought which are new a well a old and not of one age 
onli but of all nowher in plato is there a deeper ironi or a greater 
wealth of humour or imageri or more dramat power nor in ani other of 
hi write is the attempt made to interweav life and specul or 
to connect polit with philosophi the republ is the centr around 
which the other dialogu may be group here philosophi reach the 
highest point cp especi in book v vi vii to which ancient 
thinker ever attain plato among the greek like bacon among the 
modern wa the first who conceiv a method of knowledg although 
neither of them alway distinguish the bare outlin or form from 
the substanc of truth and both of them had to be content with an 
abstract of scienc which wa not yet realiz he wa the greatest 
metaphi geniu whom the world ha seen and in him more than in 
ani other ancient thinker the germ of futur knowledg are contain 
the scienc of logic and psycholog which have suppli so mani 
instrument of thought to after age are base upon the analysi 
of socrat and plato the principl of definit the law of 
contradict the fallaci of argu in a circl the distinct 
between the essenc and accid of a thing or notion between mean 
and end between cau and condit also the divi of the mind 
into the ration concupisc and irasc element or of pleasur 
and desir into necessari and unnecessari these and other great 
form of thought are all of them to be found in the republ and were 
probabl first invent by plato the greatest of all logic truth 
and the one of which writer on philosophi are most apt to lose sight 
the differ between word and thing ha been most strenuou 
insist on by him cp rep polit cratyl although he ha not 
alway avoid the confu of them in hi own write e g rep 
but he doe not bind up truth in logic formula logic is still 
veil in metaphi and the scienc which he imago to contempl 
all truth and all exist is veri unlik the doctrin of the 
syllog which aristotl claim to have discov soph elenchi 

neither must we forget that the republ is but the third part of a 
still larger design which wa to have includ an ideal histori of 
athen a well a a polit and physic philosophi the fragment of 
the critia ha given birth to a world famou fiction second onli in 
import to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur and is said a 
a fact to have inspir some of the earli navig of the sixteenth 
centuri thi mythic tale of which the subject wa a histori of the 
war of the athenian against the island of atlanti is suppo to be 
found upon an unfinish poem of solon to which it would have stood 
in the same relat a the write of the logograph to the poem of 
homer it would have told of a struggl for liberti cp tim intend 
to repr the conflict of persia and hella we may judg from the 
nobl commenc of the timaeu from the fragment of the critia 
itself and from the third book of the law in what manner plato would 
have treat thi high argument we can onli guess whi the great design 
wa abandon perhap becau plato becam sensibl of some incongru 
in a fictiti histori or becau he had lost hi interest in it or 
becau advanc year forbad the complet of it and we may plea 
ourselv with the fanci that had thi imaginari narr ever been 
finish we should have found plato himself sympathi with the 
struggl for hellen independ cp law sing a hymn of triumph 
over marathon and salami perhap make the reflect of herodotu 
where he contempl the growth of the athenian empir how brave a 
thing is freedom of speech which ha made the athenian so far 
exceed everi other state of hella in great or more probabl 
attribut the victori to the ancient good order of athen and to the 
favor of apollo and athen cp introd to critia 

again plato may be regard a the captain arhchegoz or leader 
of a goodli band of follow for in the republ is to be found the 
origin of cicero s de republica of st augustin s citi of god 
of the utopia of sir thoma more and of the numer other imaginari 
state which are frame upon the same model the extent to which 
aristotl or the aristotelian school were indebt to him in the 
polit ha been littl recogni and the recognit is the 
more necessari becau it is not made by aristotl himself the two 
philosoph had more in common than they were consciou of and 
probabl some element of plato remain still undetect in aristotl in 
english philosophi too mani affin may be trace not onli in the 
work of the cambridg platonist but in great origin writer like 
berkeley or coleridg to plato and hi idea that there is a truth 
higher than experi of which the mind bear wit to herself is 
a convict which in our own gener ha been enthusiast 
assert and is perhap gain ground of the greek author who at the 
renaiss brought a new life into the world plato ha had the greatest 
influenc the republ of plato is also the first treati upon 
educ of which the write of milton and lock rousseau jean 
paul and goeth are the legitim descend like dant or bunyan 
he ha a revel of anoth life like bacon he is profoundli 
impress with the uniti of knowledg in the earli church he exerci 
a real influenc on theolog and at the reviv of literatur on 
polit even the fragment of hi word when repeat at second hand 
symp have in all age ravish the heart of men who have seen 
reflect in them their own higher natur he is the father of ideal 
in philosophi in polit in literatur and mani of the latest 
concept of modern thinker and statesman such a the uniti of 
knowledg the reign of law and the equal of the sex have been 
anticip in a dream by him 

the argument of the republ is the search after justic the natur 
of which is first hint at by cephalu the just and blameless old 
man then discu on the basi of proverbi moral by socrat and 
polemarchu then caricatur by thrasymachu and partial explain 
by socrat reduc to an abstract by glaucon and adeimantu and 
have becom invi in the individu reappear at length in the 
ideal state which is construct by socrat the first care of the 
ruler is to be educ of which an outlin is drawn after the old 
hellen model provid onli for an improv religion and moral 
and more simplic in music and gymnast a manlier strain of poetri 
and greater harmoni of the individu and the state we are thu led on 
to the concept of a higher state in which no man call anyth hi 
own and in which there is neither marri nor give in marriag 
and king are philosoph and philosoph are king and there 
is anoth and higher educ intellectu a well a moral and 
religi of scienc a well a of art and not of youth onli but of 
the whole of life such a state is hardli to be realiz in thi world 
and quickli degen to the perfect ideal succ the govern 
of the soldier and the lover of honour thi again declin into 
democraci and democraci into tyranni in an imaginari but regular order 
have not much resembl to the actual fact when the wheel ha 
come full circl we do not begin again with a new period of human life 
but we have pa from the best to the worst and there we end the 
subject is then chang and the old quarrel of poetri and philosophi 
which had been more lightli treat in the earlier book of the republ 
is now resum and fought out to a conclu poetri is discov to 
be an imit thrice remov from the truth and homer a well a 
the dramat poet have been condemn a an imit is sent into 
banish along with them and the idea of the state is supplement by 
the revel of a futur life 

the divi into book like all similar divi cp sir g c lewi 
in the classic museum is probabl later than the age of plato the 
natur divi are five in number 1 book i and the first half 
of book ii down to the paragraph begin i had alway admir the 
geniu of glaucon and adeimantu which is introductori the first 
book contain a refut of the popular and sophist notion of 
justic and conclud like some of the earlier dialogu without 
arriv at ani definit result to thi is append a restat of 
the natur of justic accord to common opinion and an answer is 
demand to the question what is justic strip of appear the 
second divi 2 includ the remaind of the second and the whole 
of the third and fourth book which are mainli occupi with the 
construct of the first state and the first educ the third 
divi 3 consist of the fifth sixth and seventh book in which 
philosophi rather than justic is the subject of enquiri and the 
second state is construct on principl of commun and rule by 
philosoph and the contempl of the idea of good take the place 
of the social and polit virtu in the eighth and ninth book 4 
the perver of state and of the individu who correspond to them 
are review in success and the natur of pleasur and the principl 
of tyranni are further anali in the individu man the tenth book 
5 is the conclu of the whole in which the relat of philosophi 
to poetri are final determin and the happi of the citizen 
in thi life which ha now been assur is crown by the vision of 
anoth 

or a more gener divi into two part may be adopt the first 
book i iv contain the descript of a state frame gener in 
accord with hellen notion of religion and moral while in the 
second book v x the hellen state is transform into an 
ideal kingdom of philosophi of which all other govern are the 
perver these two point of view are realli oppo and the 
opposit is onli veil by the geniu of plato the republ like 
the phaedru see introduct to phaedru is an imperfect whole the 
higher light of philosophi break through the regular of the 
hellen templ which at last fade away into the heaven whether thi 
imperfect of structur ari from an enlarg of the plan 
or from the imperfect reconcil in the writer s own mind of the 
struggl element of thought which are now first brought togeth 
by him or perhap from the composit of the work at differ 
time are question like the similar question about the iliad and 
the odyssey which are worth ask but which cannot have a distinct 
answer in the age of plato there wa no regular mode of public 
and an author would have the le scrupl in alter or ad to a 
work which wa known onli to a few of hi friend there is no absurd 
in suppo that he may have laid hi labour asid for a time or 
turn from one work to anoth and such interrupt would be more 
like to occur in the case of a long than of a short write in all 
attempt to determin the chronolog order of the platon write 
on intern evid thi uncertainti about ani singl dialogu be 
compo at one time is a disturb element which must be admit 
to affect longer work such a the republ and the law more than 
shorter one but on the other hand the seem discrep of 
the republ may onli ari out of the discord element which the 
philosoph ha attempt to unit in a singl whole perhap without 
be himself abl to recogni the inconsist which is obviou to 
u for there is a judgment of after age which few great writer have 
ever been abl to anticip for themselv they do not perceiv the 
want of connexion in their own write or the gap in their system 
which are visibl enough to those who come after them in the begin 
of literatur and philosophi amid the first effort of thought and 
languag more inconsist occur than now when the path of 
specul are well worn and the mean of word preci defin 
for consist too is the growth of time and some of the greatest 
creation of the human mind have been want in uniti tri by thi 
test sever of the platon dialogu accord to our modern idea 
appear to be defect but the defici is no proof that they were 
compo at differ time or by differ hand and the supposit 
that the republ wa written uninterruptedli and by a continu effort 
is in some degr confirm by the numer refer from one part of 
the work to anoth 

the second titl concern justic is not the one by which the 
republ is quot either by aristotl or gener in antiqu and 
like the other second titl of the platon dialogu may therefor be 
assum to be of later date morgenstern and other have ask 
whether the definit of justic which is the profess aim or the 
construct of the state is the princip argument of the work the 
answer is that the two blend in one and are two face of the same 
truth for justic is the order of the state and the state is the 
visibl embodi of justic under the condit of human societi the 
one is the soul and the other is the bodi and the greek ideal of the 
state a of the individu is a fair mind in a fair bodi in hegelian 
phraseolog the state is the realiti of which justic is the idea or 
describ in christian languag the kingdom of god is within and yet 
develop into a church or extern kingdom the hou not made with 
hand etern in the heaven is reduc to the proport of an 
earthli build or to use a platon imag justic and the state are 
the warp and the woof which run through the whole textur and when the 
constitut of the state is complet the concept of justic is not 
dismiss but reappear under the same or differ name throughout 
the work both a the inner law of the individu soul and final a 
the principl of reward and punish in anoth life the virtu 
are base on justic of which common honesti in buy and sell 
is the shadow and justic is base on the idea of good which is the 
harmoni of the world and is reflect both in the institut of 
state and in motion of the heavenli bodi cp tim the timaeu 
which take up the polit rather than the ethic side of the 
republ and is chiefli occupi with hypothesi concern the outward 
world yet contain mani indic that the same law is suppo to 
reign over the state over natur and over man 

too much howev ha been made of thi question both in ancient and 
modern time there is a stage of critic in which all work whether 
of natur or of art are refer to design now in ancient write 
and ind in literatur gener there remain often a larg element 
which wa not comprehend in the origin design for the plan grow 
under the author s hand new thought occur to him in the act of 
write he ha not work out the argument to the end befor he begin 
the reader who seek to find some one idea under which the whole may be 
conceiv must necessarili seiz on the vaguest and most gener thu 
stallbaum who is dissatisfi with the ordinari explan of the 
argument of the republ imago himself to have found the true 
argument in the repres of human life in a state perfect by 
justic and govern accord to the idea of good there may be some 
use in such gener descript but they can hardli be said to express 
the design of the writer the truth is that we may a well speak of 
mani design a of one nor need anyth be exclud from the plan of 
a great work to which the mind is natur led by the associ of 
idea and which doe not interf with the gener purpo what kind 
or degr of uniti is to be sought after in a build in the plastic 
art in poetri in prose is a problem which ha to be determin 
rel to the subject matter to plato himself the enquiri what 
wa the intent of the writer or what wa the princip argument 
of the republ would have been hardli intellig and therefor had 
better be at onc dismiss cp the introduct to the phaedru 

is not the republ the vehicl of three or four great truth which 
to plato s own mind are most natur repr in the form of the 
state just a in the jewish prophet the reign of messiah or the day 
of the lord or the suffer servant or peopl of god or the sun of 
righteou with heal in hi wing onli convey to u at least 
their great spiritu ideal so through the greek state plato reveal 
to u hi own thought about divin perfect which is the idea of 
good like the sun in the visibl world about human perfect which 
is justic about educ begin in youth and continu in later 
year about poet and sophist and tyrant who are the fal teacher 
and evil ruler of mankind about the world which is the embodi of 
them about a kingdom which exist nowher upon earth but is laid up 
in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life no such inspir 
creation is at uniti with itself ani more than the cloud of heaven 
when the sun pierc through them everi shade of light and dark of 
truth and of fiction which is the veil of truth is allow in a work 
of philosoph imagin it is not all on the same plane it easili 
pa from idea to myth and fanci from fact to figur of speech 
it is not prose but poetri at least a great part of it and ought not 
to be judg by the rule of logic or the probabl of histori the 
writer is not fashion hi idea into an artist whole they take 
poss of him and are too much for him we have no need therefor 
to discu whether a state such a plato ha conceiv is practic or 
not or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the 
mind of the writer for the practic of hi idea ha noth to 
do with their truth and the highest thought to which he attain may be 
truli said to bear the greatest mark of design justic more than the 
extern frame work of the state the idea of good more than justic 
the great scienc of dialect or the organi of idea ha no real 
content but is onli a type of the method or spirit in which the 
higher knowledg is to be pursu by the spectat of all time and 
all exist it is in the fifth sixth and seventh book that plato 
reach the summit of specul and these although they fail to 
satisfi the requir of a modern thinker may therefor be regard 
a the most import a they are also the most origin portion of 
the work 

it is not necessari to discu at length a minor question which ha 
been rai by boeckh respect the imaginari date at which the 
conver wa held the year 411 b c which is propo by him will 
do a well a ani other for a writer of fiction and especi a 
writer who like plato is notori careless of chronolog cp rep 
symp etc onli aim at gener probabl whether all the person 
mention in the republ could ever have met at ani one time is not 
a difficulti which would have occur to an athenian read the work 
forti year later or to plato himself at the time of write ani more 
than to shakespear respect one of hi own drama and need not 
greatli troubl u now yet thi may be a question have no answer 
which is still worth ask becau the investig show that we 
cannot argu histor from the date in plato it would be useless 
therefor to wast time in invent far fetch reconcil of them 
in order to avoid chronolog difficulti such for exampl a 
the conjectur of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantu are not the 
brother but the uncl of plato cp apol or the fanci of stallbaum 
that plato intent left anachron indic the date at which 
some of hi dialogu were written 

the princip charact in the republ are cephalu polemarchu 
thrasymachu socrat glaucon and adeimantu cephalu appear in the 
introduct onli polemarchu drop at the end of the first argument 
and thrasymachu is reduc to silenc at the close of the first book 
the main discu is carri on by socrat glaucon and adeimantu 
among the compani are lysia the orat and euthydemu the son of 
cephalu and brother of polemarchu an unknown charmantid these are 
mute auditor also there is cleitophon who onc interrupt where a 
in the dialogu which bear hi name he appear a the friend and alli 
of thrasymachu 

cephalu the patriarch of the hou ha been appropri engag 
in offer a sacrif he is the pattern of an old man who ha almost 
done with life and is at peac with himself and with all mankind he 
feel that he is draw nearer to the world below and seem to linger 
around the memori of the past he is eager that socrat should come 
to visit him fond of the poetri of the last gener happi in the 
consciou of a well spent life glad at have escap from the 
tyranni of youth lust hi love of conver hi affect hi 
indiff to rich even hi garrul are interest trait of 
charact he is not one of those who have noth to say becau their 
whole mind ha been absorb in make money yet he acknowledg 
that rich have the advantag of place men abov the temptat 
to dishonesti or falsehood the respect attent shown to him by 
socrat whose love of conver no le than the mission impo 
upon him by the oracl lead him to ask question of all men young and 
old alik should also be note who better suit to rai the question 
of justic than cephalu whose life might seem to be the express of 
it the moder with which old age is pictur by cephalu a a veri 
toler portion of exist is characterist not onli of him 
but of greek feel gener and contrast with the exagg of 
cicero in the de senectut the even of life is describ by plato 
in the most express manner yet with the fewest possibl touch a 
cicero remark ep ad attic the age cephalu would have been out of 
place in the discu which follow and which he could neither have 
understood nor taken part in without a violat of dramat proprieti 
cp lysimachu in the lach 

hi son and heir polemarchu ha the frank and impetu of 
youth he is for detain socrat by forc in the open scene 
and will not let him off on the subject of woman and child 
like cephalu he is limit in hi point of view and repr 
the proverbi stage of moral which ha rule of life rather than 
principl and he quot simonid cp aristoph cloud a hi father 
had quot pindar but after thi he ha no more to say the answer 
which he make are onli elicit from him by the dialect of socrat 
he ha not yet experienc the influenc of the sophist like glaucon 
and adeimantu nor is he sensibl of the necess of refut them he 
belong to the pre socrat or pre dialect age he is incap of 
argu and is bewild by socrat to such a degr that he doe not 
know what he is say he is made to admit that justic is a thief and 
that the virtu follow the analog of the art from hi brother lysia 
contra eratosth we learn that he fell a victim to the thirti tyrant 
but no allu is here made to hi fate nor to the circumst that 
cephalu and hi famili were of syracusan origin and had migrat from 
thurii to athen 

the chalcedonian giant thrasymachu of whom we have alreadi heard 
in the phaedru is the personif of the sophist accord to 
plato s concept of them in some of their worst characterist he 
is vain and bluster refu to discour unless he is paid fond of 
make an orat and hope therebi to escap the inevit socrat 
but a mere child in argument and unabl to fores that the next move 
to use a platon express will shut him up he ha reach the 
stage of frame gener notion and in thi respect is in advanc of 
cephalu and polemarchu but he is incap of defend them in a 
discu and vainli tri to cover hi confu with banter and 
insol whether such doctrin a are attribut to him by plato were 
realli held either by him or by ani other sophist is uncertain in the 
infanc of philosophi seriou error about moral might easili grow 
up they are certainli put into the mouth of speaker in thucydid 
but we are concern at present with plato s descript of him and not 
with the histor realiti the inequ of the contest add greatli 
to the humour of the scene the pompou and empti sophist is utterli 
helpless in the hand of the great master of dialect who know how 
to touch all the spring of vaniti and weak in him he is greatli 
irrit by the ironi of socrat but hi noisi and imbecil rage 
onli lay him more and more open to the thrust of hi assail hi 
determin to cram down their throat or put bodili into their 
soul hi own word elicit a cri of horror from socrat the 
state of hi temper is quit a worthi of remark a the process of the 
argument noth is more amu than hi complet submiss when 
he ha been onc thoroughli beaten at first he seem to continu the 
discu with reluct but soon with appar good will and he 
even testifi hi interest at a later stage by one or two occas 
remark when attack by glaucon he is humor protect by socrat 
a one who ha never been hi enemi and is now hi friend from cicero 
and quintilian and from aristotl s rhetor we learn that the sophist 
whom plato ha made so ridicul wa a man of note whose write were 
preserv in later age the play on hi name which wa made by hi 
contemporari herodicu ari rhet thou wast ever bold in 
battl seem to show that the descript of him is not devoid of 
verisimilitud 

when thrasymachu ha been silenc the two princip respond 
glaucon and adeimantu appear on the scene here a in greek tragedi 
cp introd to phaedo three actor are introduc at first sight 
the two son of ariston may seem to wear a famili like like the two 
friend simmia and cebe in the phaedo but on a nearer examin 
of them the similar vanish and they are seen to be distinct 
charact glaucon is the impetu youth who can just never have 
enough of fecht cp the charact of him in xen mem iii 6 
the man of pleasur who is acquaint with the mysteri of love the 
juveni qui gaudet canibu and who improv the breed of anim the 
lover of art and music who ha all the experi of youth life he 
is full of quick and penetr pierc easili below the clumsi 
platitud of thrasymachu to the real difficulti he turn out to the 
light the seami side of human life and yet doe not lose faith in the 
just and true it is glaucon who seiz what may be term the ludicr 
relat of the philosoph to the world to whom a state of simplic 
is a citi of pig who is alway prepar with a jest when the 
argument offer him an opportun and who is ever readi to second 
the humour of socrat and to appreci the ridicul whether in 
the connoisseur of music or in the lover of theatric or in the 
fantast behaviour of the citizen of democraci hi weak are 
sever time allud to by socrat who howev will not allow him 
to be attack by hi brother adeimantu he is a soldier and like 
adeimantu ha been distinguish at the battl of megara anno 
456 the charact of adeimantu is deeper and graver and the 
profound object are commonli put into hi mouth glaucon is more 
demonstr and gener open the game adeimantu pursu the 
argument further glaucon ha more of the live and quick sympathi 
of youth adeimantu ha the matur judgment of a grown up man of 
the world in the second book when glaucon insist that justic and 
injust shall be consid without regard to their consequ 
adeimantu remark that they are regard by mankind in gener onli for 
the sake of their consequ and in a similar vein of reflect he 
urg at the begin of the fourth book that socrat fail in make 
hi citizen happi and is answer that happi is not the first but 
the second thing not the direct aim but the indirect consequ of 
the good govern of a state in the discu about religion and 
mytholog adeimantu is the respond but glaucon break in with a 
slight jest and carri on the conver in a lighter tone about 
music and gymnast to the end of the book it is adeimantu again 
who volunt the critic of common sen on the socrat method of 
argument and who refu to let socrat pa lightli over the question 
of woman and child it is adeimantu who is the respond in the 
more argument a glaucon in the lighter and more imagin 
portion of the dialogu for exampl throughout the greater part 
of the sixth book the cau of the corrupt of philosophi and the 
concept of the idea of good are discu with adeimantu glaucon 
resum hi place of princip respond but he ha a difficulti in 
apprehend the higher educ of socrat and make some fal hit 
in the cour of the discu onc more adeimantu return with the 
allu to hi brother glaucon whom he compar to the contenti 
state in the next book he is again supers and glaucon continu to 
the end 

thu in a success of charact plato repr the success 
stage of moral begin with the athenian gentleman of the olden 
time who is follow by the practic man of that day regul hi 
life by proverb and saw to him succ the wild gener of 
the sophist and lastli come the young discipl of the great teacher 
who know the sophist argument but will not be convinc by them 
and desir to go deeper into the natur of thing these too like 
cephalu polemarchu thrasymachu are clearli distinguish from one 
anoth neither in the republ nor in ani other dialogu of plato is 
a singl charact repeat 

the delin of socrat in the republ is not wholli consist in 
the first book we have more of the real socrat such a he is depict 
in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliest dialogu of plato and 
in the apolog he is iron provok question the old enemi 
of the sophist readi to put on the mask of silenu a well a to argu 
seriou but in the sixth book hi enmiti toward the sophist abat 
he acknowledg that they are the repr rather than the 
corrupt of the world he also becom more dogmat and construct 
pa beyond the rang either of the polit or the specul 
idea of the real socrat in one passag plato himself seem to 
intim that the time had now come for socrat who had pa hi 
whole life in philosophi to give hi own opinion and not to be alway 
repeat the notion of other men there is no evid that either the 
idea of good or the concept of a perfect state were comprehend in 
the socrat teach though he certainli dwelt on the natur of 
the univ and of final cau cp xen mem phaedo and a deep 
thinker like him in hi thirti or forti year of public teach could 
hardli have fail to touch on the natur of famili relat for 
which there is also some posit evid in the memorabilia mem the 
socrat method is nomin retain and everi infer is either put 
into the mouth of the respond or repr a the common discoveri 
of him and socrat but ani one can see that thi is a mere form of 
which the affect grow wearisom a the work advanc the method 
of enquiri ha pa into a method of teach in which by the help of 
interlocutor the same thesi is look at from variou point of view 
the natur of the process is truli charact by glaucon when 
he describ himself a a companion who is not good for much in an 
investig but can see what he is shown and may perhap give the 
answer to a question more fluentli than anoth 

neither can we be absolut certain that socrat himself taught the 
immort of the soul which is unknown to hi discipl glaucon in the 
republ cp apol nor is there ani reason to suppo that he use 
myth or revel of anoth world a a vehicl of instruct 
or that he would have banish poetri or have denounc the greek 
mytholog hi favorit oath is retain and a slight mention is made 
of the daemonium or intern sign which is allud to by socrat a 
a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real element of socrat teach 
which is more promin in the republ than in ani of the other 
dialogu of plato is the use of exampl and illustr greek 
let u appli the test of common instanc you say adeimantu 
iron in the sixth book are so unaccustom to speak in imag 
and thi use of exampl or imag though truli socrat in origin is 
enlarg by the geniu of plato into the form of an allegori or parabl 
which embodi in the concret what ha been alreadi describ or is 
about to be describ in the abstract thu the figur of the cave in 
book vii is a recapitul of the divi of knowledg in book vi 
the composit anim in book ix is an allegori of the part of the 
soul the nobl captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi are 
a figur of the relat of the peopl to the philosoph in the 
state which ha been describ other figur such a the dog or 
the marriag of the portionless maiden or the drone and wasp in the 
eighth and ninth book also form link of connexion in long passag 
or are use to recal previou discu 

plato is most true to the charact of hi master when he describ him 
a not of thi world and with thi repres of him the ideal 
state and the other paradox of the republ are quit in accord 
though they cannot be shown to have been specul of socrat to 
him a to other great teacher both philosoph and religi when 
they look upward the world seem to be the embodi of error and 
evil the common sen of mankind ha revolt against thi view or 
ha onli partial admit it and even in socrat himself the sterner 
judgement of the multitud at time pa into a sort of iron piti 
or love men in gener are incap of philosophi and are therefor 
at enmiti with the philosoph but their misunderstand of him is 
unavoid for they have never seen him a he truli is in hi own 
imag they are onli acquaint with artifici system poss no 
nativ forc of truth word which admit of mani applic their 
leader have noth to measur with and are therefor ignor of 
their own statur but they are to be piti or laugh at not to be 
quarrel with they mean well with their nostrum if they could onli 
learn that they are cut off a hydra s head thi moder toward 
those who are in error is one of the most characterist featur 
of socrat in the republ in all the differ repres of 
socrat whether of xenophon or plato and amid the differ of 
the earlier or later dialogu he alway retain the charact of the 
unweari and disinterest seeker after truth without which he would 
have cea to be socrat 

leav the charact we may now anali the content of the republ 
and then proceed to consid 1 the gener aspect of thi hellen 
ideal of the state 2 the modern light in which the thought of plato 
may be read 

book i the republ open with a truli greek scene a festiv in 
honour of the goddess bendi which is held in the piraeu to thi is 
ad the promi of an equestrian torch race in the even the whole 
work is suppo to be recit by socrat on the day after the festiv 
to a small parti consist of critia timaeu hermocr and 
anoth thi we learn from the first word of the timaeu 

when the rhetor advantag of recit the dialogu ha been gain 
the attent is not distract by ani refer to the audienc nor 
is the reader further remind of the extraordinari length of the 
narr of the numer compani three onli take ani seriou part in 
the discu nor are we inform whether in the even they went to 
the torch race or talk a in the symposium through the night 
the manner in which the conver ha arisen is describ a 
follow socrat and hi companion glaucon are about to leav the 
festiv when they are detain by a messag from polemarchu who 
speedili appear accompani by adeimantu the brother of glaucon and 
with play violenc compel them to remain promi them not onli 
the torch race but the pleasur of conver with the young which 
to socrat is a far greater attract they return to the hou of 
cephalu polemarchu father now in extrem old age who is found 
sit upon a cushion seat crown for a sacrif you should come 
to me often socrat for i am too old to go to you and at my time 
of life have lost other pleasur i care the more for conver 
socrat ask him what he think of age to which the old man repli 
that the sorrow and discont of age are to be attribut to the 
temper of men and that age is a time of peac in which the tyranni 
of the passion is no longer felt ye repli socrat but the world 
will say cephalu that you are happi in old age becau you are rich 
and there is someth in what they say socrat but not so much a 
they imagin a themistocl repli to the seriphian neither you if 
you had been an athenian nor i if i had been a seriphian would ever 
have been famou i might in like manner repli to you neither a good 
poor man can be happi in age nor yet a bad rich man socrat remark 
that cephalu appear not to care about rich a qualiti which he 
ascrib to hi have inherit not acquir them and would like 
to know what he consid to be the chief advantag of them cephalu 
answer that when you are old the belief in the world below grow upon 
you and then to have done justic and never to have been compel to 
do injust through poverti and never to have deceiv anyon are 
felt to be unspeak bless socrat who is evid prepar 
for an argument next ask what is the mean of the word justic to 
tell the truth and pay your debt no more than thi or must we admit 
except ought i for exampl to put back into the hand of my 
friend who ha gone mad the sword which i borrow of him when he 
wa in hi right mind there must be except and yet say 
polemarchu the definit which ha been given ha the author 
of simonid here cephalu retir to look after the sacrif 
and bequeath a socrat faceti remark the poss of the 
argument to hi heir polemarchu 

the descript of old age is finish and plato a hi manner is ha 
touch the key note of the whole work in ask for the definit of 
justic first suggest the question which glaucon afterward pursu 
respect extern good and prepar for the conclud mythu of 
the world below in the slight allu of cephalu the portrait of the 
just man is a natur frontispiec or introduct to the long discour 
which follow and may perhap impli that in all our perplex about 
the natur of justic there is no difficulti in discern who is 
a just man the first explan ha been support by a say of 
simonid and now socrat ha a mind to show that the resolut of 
justic into two unconnect precept which have no common principl 
fail to satisfi the demand of dialect 

he proce what did simonid mean by thi say of hi did he 
mean that i wa to give back arm to a madman no not in that case 
not if the parti are friend and evil would result he meant that you 
were to do what wa proper good to friend and harm to enemi everi 
act doe someth to somebodi and follow thi analog socrat 
ask what is thi due and proper thing which justic doe and to whom 
he is answer that justic doe good to friend and harm to enemi 
but in what way good or harm in make allianc with the one and 
go to war with the other then in time of peac what is the good 
of justic the answer is that justic is of use in contract and 
contract are money partnership ye but how in such partnership 
is the just man of more use than ani other man when you want to have 
money safe kept and not use then justic will be use when money 
is useless and there is anoth difficulti justic like the art of 
war or ani other art must be of opposit good at attack a well a 
at defenc at steal a well a at guard but then justic is a 
thief though a hero notwithstand like autolycu the homer hero 
who wa excel abov all men in theft and perjuri to such a pa 
have you and homer and simonid brought u though i do not forget that 
the thiev must be for the good of friend and the harm of enemi 
and still there ari anoth question are friend to be interpret 
a real or seem enemi a real or seem and are our friend to 
be onli the good and our enemi to be the evil the answer is that 
we must do good to our seem and real good friend and evil to our 
seem and real evil enemi good to the good evil to the evil but 
ought we to render evil for evil at all when to do so will onli make 
men more evil can justic produc injust ani more than the art of 
horsemanship can make bad horseman or heat produc cold the final 
conclu is that no sage or poet ever said that the just return 
evil for evil thi wa a maxim of some rich and mighti man periand 
perdicca or ismenia the theban about b c 398 381 

thu the first stage of aphorist or unconsci moral is shown to 
be inadequ to the want of the age the author of the poet is set 
asid and through the wind maze of dialect we make an approach 
to the christian precept of forgiv of injuri similar word 
are appli by the persian mystic poet to the divin be when the 
question spirit is stir within him if becau i do evil thou 
punishest me by evil what is the differ between thee and me in 
thi both plato and kheyam rise abov the level of mani christian 
theologian the first definit of justic easili pa into the 
second for the simpl word to speak the truth and pay your debt is 
substitut the more abstract to do good to your friend and harm to 
your enemi either of these explan give a suffici rule 
of life for plain men but they both fall short of the preci of 
philosophi we may note in pa the antiqu of casuistri which not 
onli ari out of the conflict of establish principl in particular 
case but also out of the effort to attain them and is prior a well 
a posterior to our fundament notion of moral the interrog 
of moral idea the appeal to the author of homer the conclu 
that the maxim do good to your friend and harm to your enemi 
be erron could not have been the word of ani great man are all 
of them veri characterist of the platon socrat 

here thrasymachu who ha made sever attempt to interrupt but 
ha hitherto been kept in order by the compani take advantag of a 
pau and rush into the arena begin like a savag anim with a 
roar socrat he say what folli is thi whi do you agr to be 
vanquish by one anoth in a pretend argument he then prohibit 
all the ordinari definit of justic to which socrat repli that 
he cannot tell how mani twelv is if he is forbidden to say 2 x 6 or 
3 x 4 or 6 x 2 or 4 x 3 at first thrasymachu is reluct to argu 
but at length with a promi of payment on the part of the compani and 
of prai from socrat he is induc to open the game listen he 
say my answer is that might is right justic the interest of the 
stronger now prai me let me understand you first do you mean that 
becau polydama the wrestler who is stronger than we are find the 
eat of beef for hi interest the eat of beef is also for our 
interest who are not so strong thrasymachu is indign at the 
illustr and in pompou word appar intend to restor 
digniti to the argument he explain hi mean to be that the ruler 
make law for their own interest but suppo say socrat that the 
ruler or stronger make a mistak then the interest of the stronger is 
not hi interest thrasymachu is save from thi speedi downfal by hi 
discipl cleitophon who introduc the word think not the actual 
interest of the ruler but what he think or what seem to be hi 
interest is justic the contradict is escap by the unmean 
eva for though hi real and appar interest may differ what the 
ruler think to be hi interest will alway remain what he think to be 
hi interest 

of cour thi wa not the origin assert nor is the new 
interpret accept by thrasymachu himself but socrat is not 
dispo to quarrel about word if a he significantli insinu 
hi adversari ha chang hi mind in what follow thrasymachu doe 
in fact withdraw hi admiss that the ruler may make a mistak for he 
affirm that the ruler a a ruler is infal socrat is quit readi 
to accept the new posit which he equal turn against thrasymachu 
by the help of the analog of the art everi art or scienc ha an 
interest but thi interest is to be distinguish from the accid 
interest of the artist and is onli concern with the good of the 
thing or person which come under the art and justic ha an interest 
which is the interest not of the ruler or judg but of those who come 
under hi sway 

thrasymachu is on the brink of the inevit conclu when he make 
a bold diver tell me socrat he say have you a nur what 
a question whi do you ask becau if you have she neglect you and 
let you go about drivel and ha not even taught you to know the 
shepherd from the sheep for you fanci that shepherd and ruler never 
think of their own interest but onli of their sheep or subject 
wherea the truth is that they fatten them for their use sheep and 
subject alik and experi prof that in everi relat of life 
the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer especi where 
injust is on the grand scale which is quit anoth thing from the 
petti rogueri of swindler and burglar and robber of templ the 
languag of men prof thi our graciou and bless tyrant and the 
like all which tend to show 1 that justic is the interest of the 
stronger and 2 that injust is more profit and also stronger 
than justic 

thrasymachu who is better at a speech than at a close argument have 
delug the compani with word ha a mind to escap but the other 
will not let him go and socrat add a humbl but earnest request that 
he will not desert them at such a crisi of their fate and what can i 
do more for you he say would you have me put the word bodili 
into your soul god forbid repli socrat but we want you to be 
consist in the use of term and not to employ physician in an 
exact sen and then again shepherd or ruler in an inexact if the 
word are strictli taken the ruler and the shepherd look onli to the 
good of their peopl or flock and not to their own wherea you insist 
that ruler are sole actuat by love of offic no doubt about it 
repli thrasymachu then whi are they paid is not the reason that 
their interest is not comprehend in their art and is therefor the 
concern of anoth art the art of pay which is common to the art in 
gener and therefor not ident with ani one of them nor would ani 
man be a ruler unless he were induc by the hope of reward or the fear 
of punish the reward is money or honour the punish is the 
necess of be rule by a man wor than himself and if a state or 
church were compo entir of good men they would be affect by 
the last motiv onli and there would be a much nolo episcopari a 
there is at present of the opposit 

the satir on exist govern is heighten by the simpl and 
appar incid manner in which the last remark is introduc 
there is a similar ironi in the argument that the governor of mankind 
do not like be in offic and that therefor they demand pay 

enough of thi the other assert of thrasymachu is far more 
import that the unjust life is more gain than the just now a 
you and i glaucon are not convinc by him we must repli to him but 
if we tri to compar their respect gain we shall want a judg 
to decid for u we had better therefor proceed by make mutual 
admiss of the truth to one anoth 

thrasymachu had assert that perfect injust wa more gain than 
perfect justic and after a littl hesit he is induc by socrat 
to admit the still greater paradox that injust is virtu and justic 
vice socrat prai hi frank and assum the attitud of one 
whose onli wish is to understand the mean of hi oppon at the 
same time he is weav a net in which thrasymachu is final enclo 
the admiss is elicit from him that the just man seek to gain an 
advantag over the unjust onli but not over the just while the unjust 
would gain an advantag over either socrat in order to test thi 
statement employ onc more the favourit analog of the art the 
musician doctor skill artist of ani sort doe not seek to gain more 
than the skill but onli more than the unskil that is to say he 
work up to a rule standard law and doe not exceed it wherea the 
unskil make random effort at excess thu the skill fall on the 
side of the good and the unskil on the side of the evil and the 
just is the skill and the unjust is the unskil 

there wa great difficulti in bring thrasymachu to the point the 
day wa hot and he wa stream with perspir and for the first 
time in hi life he wa seen to blush but hi other thesi that 
injust wa stronger than justic ha not yet been refut and 
socrat now proce to the consid of thi which with the 
assist of thrasymachu he hope to clear up the latter is at first 
churlish but in the judici hand of socrat is soon restor to 
good humour is there not honour among thief is not the strength of 
injust onli a remnant of justic is not absolut injust absolut 
weak also a hou that is divid against itself cannot stand two 
men who quarrel detract from one anoth s strength and he who is at 
war with himself is the enemi of himself and the god not wick 
therefor but semi wick flourish in state a remnant of 
good is need in order to make union in action possibl there is no 
kingdom of evil in thi world 

anoth question ha not been answer is the just or the unjust the 
happier to thi we repli that everi art ha an end and an excel 
or virtu by which the end is accomplish and is not the end of 
the soul happi and justic the excel of the soul by which 
happi is attain justic and happi be thu shown to be 
insepar the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier 
ha disappear 

thrasymachu repli let thi be your entertain socrat at the 
festiv of bendi ye and a veri good entertain with which your 
kind ha suppli me now that you have left off scold and yet 
not a good entertain but that wa my own fault for i tast of too 
mani thing first of all the natur of justic wa the subject of our 
enquiri and then whether justic is virtu and wisdom or evil and 
folli and then the compar advantag of just and unjust and the 
sum of all is that i know not what justic is how then shall i know 
whether the just is happi or not 

thu the sophist fabric ha been demolish chiefli by appeal 
to the analog of the art justic is like the art 1 in have no 
extern interest and 2 in not aim at excess and 3 justic is 
to happi what the implement of the workman is to hi work at thi 
the modern reader is apt to stumbl becau he forget that plato is 
write in an age when the art and the virtu like the moral 
and intellectu faculti were still undistinguish among earli 
enquir into the natur of human action the art help to fill up 
the void of specul and at first the comparison of the art and the 
virtu wa not perceiv by them to be fallaci they onli saw the 
point of agreement in them and not the point of differ virtu 
like art must take mean to an end good manner are both an art and 
a virtu charact is natur describ under the imag of a statu 
and there are mani other figur of speech which are readili transfer 
from art to moral the next gener clear up these perplex 
or at least suppli after age with a further analysi of them the 
contemporari of plato were in a state of transit and had not yet 
fulli realiz the common sen distinct of aristotl that virtu 
is concern with action art with product nic eth or that 
virtu impli intent and constanc of purpo wherea art 
requir knowledg onli and yet in the absurd which follow from 
some u of the analog there seem to be an intim convey that 
virtu is more than art thi is impli in the reductio ad absurdum 
that justic is a thief and in the dissatisfact which socrat 
express at the final result 

the express an art of pay which is describ a common to all the 
art is not in accord with the ordinari use of languag nor is it 
employ elsewh either by plato or by ani other greek writer it is 
suggest by the argument and seem to extend the concept of art to 
do a well a make anoth flaw or inaccuraci of languag may be 
note in the word men who are injur are made more unjust for 
those who are injur are not necessarili made wor but onli harm or 
ill treat 

the second of the three argument that the just doe not aim at 
excess ha a real mean though wrap up in an enigmat form 
that the good is of the natur of the finit is a peculiarli hellen 
sentiment which may be compar with the languag of those modern 
writer who speak of virtu a fit and of freedom a obedi to 
law the mathemat or logic notion of limit easili pa into an 
ethic one and even find a mytholog express in the concept 
of envi greek idea of measur equal order uniti proport 
still linger in the write of moralist and the true spirit of the 
fine art is better convey by such term than by superl 

when workman strive to do better than well 
they do confound their skill in covet king john 

the harmoni of the soul and bodi and of the part of the soul with 
one anoth a harmoni fairer than that of music note is the true 
hellen mode of conceiv the perfect of human natur 

in what may be call the epilogu of the discu with thrasymachu 
plato argu that evil is not a principl of strength but of discord 
and dissolut just touch the question which ha been often treat 
in modern time by theologian and philosoph of the neg natur 
of evil in the last argument we trace the germ of the aristotelian 
doctrin of an end and a virtu direct toward the end which again is 
suggest by the art the final reconcil of justic and happi 
and the ident of the individu and the state are also intim 
socrat reassum the charact of a know noth at the same time 
he appear to be not wholli satisfi with the manner in which the 
argument ha been conduct noth is conclud but the tendenc of 
the dialect process here a alway is to enlarg our concept of 
idea and to widen their applic to human life 

book ii thrasymachu is pacifi but the intrepid glaucon insist on 
continu the argument he is not satisfi with the indirect manner 
in which at the end of the last book socrat had dispo of the 
question whether the just or the unjust is the happier he begin 
by divid good into three class first good desir in 
themselv secondli good desir in themselv and for their 
result thirdli good desir for their result onli he then ask 
socrat in which of the three class he would place justic in the 
second class repli socrat among good desir for themselv and 
also for their result then the world in gener are of anoth mind 
for they say that justic belong to the troublesom class of good 
which are desir for their result onli socrat answer that thi 
is the doctrin of thrasymachu which he reject glaucon think that 
thrasymachu wa too readi to listen to the voic of the charmer and 
propo to consid the natur of justic and injust in themselv 
and apart from the result and reward of them which the world is alway 
din in hi ear he will first of all speak of the natur and origin 
of justic secondli of the manner in which men view justic a a 
necess and not a good and thirdli he will prove the reason 
of thi view 

to do injust is said to be a good to suffer injust an evil a 
the evil is discov by experi to be greater than the good the 
suffer who cannot also be doer make a compact that they will have 
neither and thi compact or mean is call justic but is realli the 
imposs of do injust no one would observ such a compact 
if he were not oblig let u suppo that the just and unjust have 
two ring like that of gyge in the well known stori which make them 
invi and then no differ will appear in them for everi one 
will do evil if he can and he who abstain will be regard by the 
world a a fool for hi pain men may prai him in public out of 
fear for themselv but they will laugh at him in their heart cp 
gorgia 

and now let u frame an ideal of the just and unjust imagin the 
unjust man to be master of hi craft seldom make mistak and easili 
correct them have gift of money speech strength the greatest 
villain bear the highest charact and at hi side let u place the 
just in hi nobl and simplic be not seem without name 
or reward cloth in hi justic onli the best of men who is thought 
to be the worst and let him die a he ha live i might add but 
i would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrist of 
injust they will tell you that the just man will be scourg 
rack bound will have hi eye put out and will at last be crucifi 
liter impal and all thi becau he ought to have prefer 
seem to be how differ is the case of the unjust who cling to 
appear a the true realiti hi high charact make him a ruler 
he can marri where he like trade where he like help hi friend and 
hurt hi enemi have got rich by dishonesti he can worship the god 
better and will therefor be more love by them than the just 

i wa think what to answer when adeimantu join in the alreadi 
unequ fray he consid that the most import point of all had 
been omit men are taught to be just for the sake of reward 
parent and guardian make reput the incent to virtu and other 
advantag are promi by them of a more solid kind such a wealthi 
marriag and high offic there are the pictur in homer and hesiod 
of fat sheep and heavi fleec rich corn field and tree toppl with 
fruit which the god provid in thi life for the just and the orphic 
poet add a similar pictur of anoth the hero of musaeu and 
eumolpu lie on couch at a festiv with garland on their head 
enjoy a the meed of virtu a paradi of immort drunken 
some go further and speak of a fair poster in the third and fourth 
gener but the wick they buri in a slough and make them carri 
water in a siev and in thi life they attribut to them the infami 
which glaucon wa assum to be the lot of the just who are suppo to 
be unjust 

take anoth kind of argument which is found both in poetri and 
prose virtu a hesiod say is honour but difficult vice is 
easi and profit you may often see the wick in great prosper 
and the righteou afflict by the will of heaven and mendic 
prophet knock at rich men s door promi to aton for the sin 
of themselv or their father in an easi fashion with sacrif and 
festiv game or with charm and invoc to get rid of an enemi 
good or bad by divin help and at a small charg they appeal to book 
profess to be written by musaeu and orpheu and carri away the 
mind of whole citi and promi to get soul out of purgatori and 
if we refu to listen to them no one know what will happen to u 

when a live mind ingenu youth hear all thi what will be hi 
conclu will he in the languag of pindar make justic hi high 
tower or fortifi himself with crook deceit justic he reflect 
without the appear of justic is miseri and ruin injust ha the 
promi of a gloriou life appear is master of truth and lord of 
happi to appear then i will turn i will put on the show 
of virtu and trail behind me the fox of archilochu i hear some one 
say that wick is not easili conceal to which i repli that 
noth great is easi union and forc and rhetor will do much and 
if men say that they cannot prevail over the god still how do we know 
that there are god onli from the poet who acknowledg that they may 
be appea by sacrif then whi not sin and pay for indulg out 
of your sin for if the righteou are onli unpunish still they have 
no further reward while the wick may be unpunish and have the 
pleasur of sin too but what of the world below nay say the 
argument there are aton power who will set that matter right a 
the poet who are the son of the god tell u and thi is confirm 
by the author of the state 

how can we resist such argument in favour of injust add good 
manner and a the wise tell u we shall make the best of both 
world who that is not a miser caitiff will refrain from smile at 
the prai of justic even if a man know the better part he will not 
be angri with other for he know also that more than human virtu is 
need to save a man and that he onli prai justic who is incap 
of injust 

the origin of the evil is that all men from the begin hero 
poet instructor of youth have alway assert the tempor 
dispen the honour and profit of justic had we been taught in 
earli youth the power of justic and injust inher in the soul and 
unseen by ani human or divin eye we should not have need other to 
be our guardian but everi one would have been the guardian of himself 
thi is what i want you to show socrat other men use argument 
which rather tend to strengthen the posit of thrasymachu that might 
is right but from you i expect better thing and plea a glaucon 
said to exclud reput let the just be thought unjust and the 
unjust just and do you still prove to u the superior of justic 

the thesi which for the sake of argument ha been maintain by 
glaucon is the conver of that of thrasymachu not right is the 
interest of the stronger but right is the necess of the weaker 
start from the same premi he carri the analysi of societi a 
step further back might is still right but the might is the weak 
of the mani combin against the strength of the few 

there have been theori in modern a well a in ancient time which 
have a famili like to the specul of glaucon e g that power 
is the foundat of right or that a monarch ha a divin right to 
govern well or ill or that virtu is self love or the love of power or 
that war is the natur state of man or that privat vice are public 
benefit all such theori have a kind of plausibl from their 
partial agreement with experi for human natur oscil between 
good and evil and the motif of action and the origin of institut 
may be explain to a certain extent on either hypothesi accord to 
the charact or point of view of a particular thinker the oblig 
of maintain author under all circumst and sometim by rather 
question mean is felt strongli and ha becom a sort of instinct 
among civil men the divin right of king or more gener of 
govern is one of the form under which thi natur feel is 
express nor again is there ani evil which ha not some accompani 
of good or pleasur nor ani good which is free from some alloy of evil 
nor ani nobl or gener thought which may not be attend by a shadow 
or the ghost of a shadow of self interest or of self love we know that 
all human action are imperfect but we do not therefor attribut 
them to the wor rather than to the better motiv or principl such 
a philosophi is both foolish and fal like that opinion of the clever 
rogu who assum all other men to be like himself and theori of thi 
sort do not repr the real natur of the state which is base on a 
vagu sen of right gradual correct and enlarg by custom and law 
although capabl also of perver ani more than they describ the 
origin of societi which is to be sought in the famili and in the 
social and religi feel of man nor do they repr the averag 
charact of individu which cannot be explain simpli on a theori 
of evil but ha alway a counteract element of good and a men 
becom better such theori appear more and more untruth to them 
becau they are more consciou of their own disinterest a littl 
experi may make a man a cynic a great deal will bring him back to 
a truer and kindlier view of the mix natur of himself and hi fellow 
men 

the two brother ask socrat to prove to them that the just is happi 
when they have taken from him all that in which happi is ordinarili 
suppo to consist not that there is 1 ani absurd in the attempt 
to frame a notion of justic apart from circumst for the ideal 
must alway be a paradox when compar with the ordinari condit of 
human life neither the stoical ideal nor the christian ideal is true a 
a fact but they may serv a a basi of educ and may exerci an 
ennobl influenc an ideal is none the wor becau some one ha 
made the discoveri that no such ideal wa ever realiz and in a 
few except individu who are rai abov the ordinari level of 
human the ideal of happi may be realiz in death and miseri 
thi may be the state which the reason delib approv and which 
the utilitarian a well a everi other moralist may be bound in certain 
case to prefer 

nor again 2 must we forget that plato though he agr gener 
with the view impli in the argument of the two brother is not 
express hi own final conclu but rather seek to dramat one 
of the aspect of ethic truth he is develop hi idea gradual in 
a seri of posit or situat he is exhibit socrat for the 
first time undergo the socrat interrog lastli 3 the word 
happi involv some degr of confu becau associ in the 
languag of modern philosophi with consciou pleasur or satisfact 
which wa not equal present to hi mind 

glaucon ha been draw a pictur of the miseri of the just and the 
happi of the unjust to which the miseri of the tyrant in book ix is 
the answer and parallel and still the unjust must appear just that is 
the homag which vice pay to virtu but now adeimantu take up 
the hint which had been alreadi given by glaucon proce to show 
that in the opinion of mankind justic is regard onli for the sake of 
reward and reput and point out the advantag which is given to 
such argument a those of thrasymachu and glaucon by the convent 
moral of mankind he seem to feel the difficulti of justifi the 
way of god to man both the brother touch upon the question whether 
the moral of action is determin by their consequ and both 
of them go beyond the posit of socrat that justic belong to 
the class of good not desir for themselv onli but desir for 
themselv and for their result to which he recal them in 
their attempt to view justic a an intern principl and in their 
condemn of the poet they anticip him the common life of 
greec is not enough for them they must penetr deeper into the 
natur of thing 

it ha been object that justic is honesti in the sen of glaucon and 
adeimantu but is taken by socrat to mean all virtu may we not 
more truli say that the old fashion notion of justic is enlarg by 
socrat and becom equiv to univ order or well be first 
in the state and secondli in the individu he ha found a new answer 
to hi old question protag whether the virtu are one or mani 
viz that one is the order principl of the three other in seek 
to establish the pure intern natur of justic he is met by the 
fact that man is a social be and he tri to harmoni the two 
opposit thesi a well a he can there is no more inconsist in 
thi than wa inevit in hi age and countri there is no use in 
turn upon him the cross light of modern philosophi which from some 
other point of view would appear equal inconsist plato doe not 
give the final solut of philosoph question for u nor can he be 
judg of by our standard 

the remaind of the republ is develop out of the question of 
the son of ariston three point are deserv of remark in what 
immedi follow first that the answer of socrat is altogeth 
indirect he doe not say that happi consist in the contempl 
of the idea of justic and still le will he be tempt to affirm the 
stoical paradox that the just man can be happi on the rack but first he 
dwell on the difficulti of the problem and insist on restor man to 
hi natur condit befor he will answer the question at all he 
too will frame an ideal but hi ideal comprehend not onli abstract 
justic but the whole relat of man under the fanci illustr 
of the larg letter he impli that he will onli look for justic in 
societi and that from the state he will proceed to the individu hi 
answer in substanc amount to thi that under favour condit 
i e in the perfect state justic and happi will coincid and that 
when justic ha been onc found happi may be left to take care 
of itself that he fall into some degr of inconsist when in 
the tenth book he claim to have got rid of the reward and honour 
of justic may be admit for he ha left those which exist in the 
perfect state and the philosoph who retir under the shelter of a 
wall can hardli have been esteem happi by him at least not in thi 
world still he maintain the true attitud of moral action let a man 
do hi duti first without ask whether he will be happi or not and 
happi will be the insepar accid which attend him seek ye 
first the kingdom of god and hi righteou and all these thing 
shall be ad unto you 

secondli it may be remark that plato preserv the genuin charact 
of greek thought in begin with the state and in go on to the 
individu first ethic then polit thi is the order of idea to 
u the rever is the order of histori onli after mani struggl of 
thought doe the individu assert hi right a a moral be in earli 
age he is not one but one of mani the citizen of a state which is 
prior to him and he ha no notion of good or evil apart from the law 
of hi countri or the creed of hi church and to thi type he is 
constantli tend to revert whenev the influenc of custom or of 
parti spirit or the recollect of the past becom too strong for 
him 

thirdli we may observ the confu or identif of the 
individu and the state of ethic and polit which pervad earli 
greek specul and even in modern time retain a certain degr of 
influenc the subtl differ between the collect and individu 
action of mankind seem to have escap earli thinker and we too are 
sometim in danger of forget the condit of unit human action 
whenev we either elev polit into ethic or lower ethic to the 
standard of polit the good man and the good citizen onli coincid in 
the perfect state and thi perfect cannot be attain by legisl 
act upon them from without but if at all by educ fashion 
them from within 

socrat prai the son of ariston inspir offspr of 
the renown hero a the elegiac poet term them but he doe not 
understand how they can argu so eloqu on behalf of injust while 
their charact show that they are uninfluenc by their own argument 
he know not how to answer them although he is afraid of desert 
justic in the hour of need he therefor make a condit that have 
weak eye he shall be allow to read the larg letter first and then 
go on to the smaller that is he must look for justic in the state 
first and will then proceed to the individu accordingli he begin to 
construct the state 

societi ari out of the want of man hi first want is food hi 
second a hou hi third a coat the sen of these need and the 
possibl of satisfi them by exchang draw individu togeth on 
the same spot and thi is the begin of a state which we take the 
liberti to invent although necess is the real inventor there must 
be first a husbandman secondli a builder thirdli a weaver to which 
may be ad a cobbler four or five citizen at least are requir to 
make a citi now men have differ natur and one man will do one 
thing better than mani and busi wait for no man henc there must 
be a divi of labour into differ employ into wholes 
and retail trade into worker and maker of workman s tool into 
shepherd and husbandman a citi which includ all thi will have far 
exceed the limit of four or five and yet not be veri larg but then 
again import will be requir and import necessit export 
and thi impli varieti of produc in order to attract the tast of 
purcha also merchant and ship in the citi too we must have a 
market and money and retail trade otherwi buyer and seller will 
never meet and the valuabl time of the produc will be wast in 
vain effort at exchang if we add hire servant the state will be 
complet and we may guess that somewh in the intercour of the 
citizen with one anoth justic and injust will appear 

here follow a rustic pictur of their way of life they spend their 
day in hou which they have built for themselv they make their 
own cloth and produc their own corn and wine their princip food is 
meal and flour and they drink in moder they live on the best 
of term with each other and take care not to have too mani child 
but said glaucon interpo are they not to have a relish 
certainli they will have salt and oliv and chee veget and 
fruit and chestnut to roast at the fire ti a citi of pig 
socrat whi i repli what do you want more onli the comfort of 
life sofa and tabl also sauc and sweet i see you want not 
onli a state but a luxuri state and possibl in the more complex 
frame we may sooner find justic and injust then the fine art must 
go to work everi conceiv instrument and ornament of luxuri will be 
want there will be dancer painter sculptor musician cook 
barber tire woman nur artist swineherd and neatherd too for 
the anim and physician to cure the disord of which luxuri is the 
sourc to feed all these superflu mouth we shall need a part of 
our neighbour s land and they will want a part of our and thi is the 
origin of war which may be trace to the same cau a other polit 
evil our citi will now requir the slight addit of a camp and 
the citizen will be convert into a soldier but then again our old 
doctrin of the divi of labour must not be forgotten the art of 
war cannot be learn in a day and there must be a natur aptitud 
for militari duti there will be some warlik natur who have thi 
aptitud dog keen of scent swift of foot to pursu and strong of 
limb to fight and a spirit is the foundat of courag such natur 
whether of men or anim will be full of spirit but these spirit 
natur are apt to bite and devour one anoth the union of 
gentl to friend and fierc against enemi appear to be an 
imposs and the guardian of a state requir both qualiti who 
then can be a guardian the imag of the dog suggest an answer for 
dog are gentl to friend and fierc to stranger your dog is a 
philosoph who judg by the rule of know or not know and 
philosophi whether in man or beast is the parent of gentl the 
human watchdog must be philosoph or lover of learn which will 
make them gentl and how are they to be learn without educ 

but what shall their educ be is ani better than the old fashion 
sort which is comprehend under the name of music and gymnast music 
includ literatur and literatur is of two kind true and fal 
what do you mean he said i mean that child hear stori befor 
they learn gymnast and that the stori are either untru or have 
at most one or two grain of truth in a bushel of falsehood now earli 
life is veri impress and child ought not to learn what they will 
have to unlearn when they grow up we must therefor have a censorship 
of nurseri tale banish some and keep other some of them are 
veri improp a we may see in the great instanc of homer and hesiod 
who not onli tell lie but bad lie stori about uranu and saturn 
which are immor a well a fal and which should never be spoken of 
to young person or ind at all or if at all then in a mysteri 
after the sacrif not of an eleusinian pig but of some unprocur 
anim shall our youth be encourag to beat their father by the 
exampl of zeu or our citizen be incit to quarrel by hear or 
see repres of strife among the god shall they listen to 
the narr of hephaestu bind hi mother and of zeu send him 
fli for help her when she wa beaten such tale may possibl have 
a mystic interpret but the young are incap of understand 
allegori if ani one ask what tale are to be allow we will answer 
that we are legisl and not book maker we onli lay down the 
principl accord to which book are to be written to write them is 
the duti of other 

and our first principl is that god must be repr a he is not 
a the author of all thing but of good onli we will not suffer the 
poet to say that he is the steward of good and evil or that he ha two 
cask full of destini or that athen and zeu incit pandaru to 
break the treati or that god cau the suffer of niob or of 
pelop or the trojan war or that he make men sin when he wish to 
destroy them either these were not the action of the god or god wa 
just and men were the better for be punish but that the deed wa 
evil and god the author is a wick suicid fiction which we will 
allow no one old or young to utter thi is our first and great 
principl god is the author of good onli 

and the second principl is like unto it with god is no variabl 
or chang of form reason teach u thi for if we suppo a chang 
in god he must be chang either by anoth or by himself by 
anoth but the best work of natur and art and the noblest qualiti 
of mind are least liabl to be chang by ani extern forc by 
himself but he cannot chang for the better he will hardli chang 
for the wor he remain for ever fairest and best in hi own imag 
therefor we refu to listen to the poet who tell u of here beg 
in the like of a priestess or of other deiti who prowl about at 
night in strang disgui all that blasphem nonsen with which 
mother fool the manhood out of their child must be suppress but 
some one will say that god who is himself unchang may take a form 
in relat to u whi should he for god a well a men hate the lie 
in the soul or principl of falsehood and a for ani other form of 
lie which is use for a purpo and is regard a innoc in certain 
except case what need have the god of thi for they are not 
ignor of antiqu like the poet nor are they afraid of their 
enemi nor is ani madman a friend of their god then is true he is 
absolut true he chang not he deceiv not by day or night by 
word or sign thi is our second great principl god is true away 
with the lie dream of agamemnon in homer and the accu of theti 
against apollo in aeschylu 

in order to give clear to hi concept of the state plato 
proce to trace the first principl of mutual need and of divi 
of labour in an imaginari commun of four or five citizen gradual 
thi commun increa the divi of labour extend to countri 
import necessit export a medium of exchang is requir and 
retail sit in the market place to save the time of the produc 
these are the step by which plato construct the first or primit 
state introduc the element of polit economi by the way a 
he is go to frame a second or civil state the simpl natur 
come befor the complex he indulg like rousseau in a pictur of 
primit life an idea which ha ind often had a power influenc 
on the imagin of mankind but he doe not seriou mean to say 
that one is better than the other politicu nor can ani infer 
be drawn from the descript of the first state taken apart from the 
second such a aristotl appear to draw in the polit we should not 
interpret a platon dialogu ani more than a poem or a parabl in too 
liter or matter of fact a style on the other hand when we compar 
the live fanci of plato with the dri up abstract of modern 
treati on philosophi we are compel to say with protagora that 
the mythu is more interest protag 

sever interest remark which in modern time would have a place in 
a treati on polit economi are scatter up and down the write 
of plato especi law popul free trade adult will 
and bequest beg eryxia though not plato s valu and demand 
republ divi of labour the last subject and also the origin of 
retail trade is treat with admir lucid in the second book of 
the republ but plato never combin hi econom idea into a system 
and never seem to have recogn that trade is one of the great motiv 
power of the state and of the world he would make retail trader 
onli of the inferior sort of citizen rep law though he remark 
quaintli enough law that if onli the best men and the best woman 
everywh were compel to keep tavern for a time or to carri on 
retail trade etc then we should knew how pleasant and agreeabl all 
these thing are 

the disappoint of glaucon at the citi of pig the ludicr 
descript of the minist of luxuri in the more refin state and 
the afterthought of the necess of doctor the illustr of the 
natur of the guardian taken from the dog the desir of 
offer some almost unprocur victim when impur mysteri are to be 
celebr the behaviour of zeu to hi father and of hephaestu to 
hi mother are touch of humour which have also a seriou mean in 
speak of educ plato rather startl u by affirm that a child 
must be train in falsehood first and in truth afterward yet thi is 
not veri differ from say that child must be taught through 
the medium of imagin a well a reason that their mind can onli 
develop gradual and that there is much which they must learn without 
understand thi is also the substanc of plato s view though he 
must be acknowledg to have drawn the line somewhat differ from 
modern ethic writer respect truth and falsehood to u economi 
or accommod would not be allow unless they were requir by 
the human faculti or necessari for the commun of knowledg to 
the simpl and ignor we should insist that the word wa insepar 
from the intent and that we must not be fal true i e speak 
or act fal in support of what wa right or true but plato would 
limit the use of fiction onli by requir that they should have a good 
moral effect and that such a danger weapon a falsehood should be 
employ by the ruler alon and for great object 

a greek in the age of plato attach no import to the question 
whether hi religion wa an histor fact he wa just begin to be 
consciou that the past had a histori but he could see noth beyond 
homer and hesiod whether their narr were true or fal did not 
seriou affect the polit or social life of hella men onli began 
to suspect that they were fiction when they recogni them to be 
immor and so in all religion the consid of their moral 
come first afterward the truth of the document in which they are 
record or of the event natur or supernatur which are told of 
them but in modern time and in protest countri perhap more than 
in cathol we have been too much inclin to identifi the histor 
with the moral and some have refu to believ in religion at all 
unless a superhuman accuraci wa discern in everi part of the 
record the fact of an ancient or religi histori are amongst the 
most import of all fact but they are frequent uncertain and we 
onli learn the true lesson which is to be gather from them when we 
place ourselv abov them these reflect tend to show that the 
differ between plato and ourselv though not unimport is not 
so great a might at first sight appear for we should agr with him 
in place the moral befor the histor truth of religion and 
gener in disregard those error or misstat of fact which 
necessarili occur in the earli stage of all religion we know also 
that chang in the tradit of a countri cannot be made in a day and 
are therefor toler of mani thing which scienc and critic would 
condemn 

we note in pa that the allegor interpret of mytholog 
said to have been first introduc a earli a the sixth centuri befor 
christ by theagen of rhegium wa well establish in the age of 
plato and here a in the phaedru though for a differ reason wa 
reject by him that anachron whether of religion or law when 
men have reach anoth stage of civil should be got rid of by 
fiction is in accord with univ experi great is the art of 
interpret and by a natur process which when onc discov wa 
alway go on what could not be alter wa explain away and so 
without ani palpabl inconsist there exist side by side two form 
of religion the tradit inherit or invent by the poet and 
the customari worship of the templ on the other hand there wa the 
religion of the philosoph who wa dwell in the heaven of idea 
but did not therefor refu to offer a cock to aesculapiu or to 
be seen say hi prayer at the rise of the sun at length the 
antagon between the popular and philosoph religion never so 
great among the greek a in our own age disappear and wa onli felt 
like the differ between the religion of the educ and uneduc 
among ourselv the zeu of homer and hesiod easili pa into 
the royal mind of plato philebu the giant heracl becam the 
knight errant and benefactor of mankind these and still more wonder 
transform were readili effect by the ingenu of stoic and 
neo platonist in the two or three centuri befor and after christ 
the greek and roman religion were gradual permeat by the spirit of 
philosophi have lost their ancient mean they were resolv into 
poetri and moral and probabl were never purer than at the time of 
their decay when their influenc over the world wa wane 

a singular concept which occur toward the end of the book is 
the lie in the soul thi is connect with the platon and socrat 
doctrin that involuntari ignor is wor than voluntari the lie 
in the soul is a true lie the corrupt of the highest truth the 
decept of the highest part of the soul from which he who is deceiv 
ha no power of deliv himself for exampl to repr god 
a fal or immor or accord to plato a delud men with 
appear or a the author of evil or again to affirm with 
protagora that knowledg is sensat or that be is becom 
or with thrasymachu that might is right would have been regard by 
plato a a lie of thi hate sort the greatest unconsci of the 
greatest untruth e g if in the languag of the gospel john he 
who wa blind were to say i see is anoth aspect of the state 
of mind which plato is describ the lie in the soul may be further 
compar with the sin against the holi ghost luke allow for the 
differ between greek and christian mode of speak to thi is 
oppo the lie in word which is onli such a decept a may occur 
in a play or poem or allegori or figur of speech or in ani sort of 
accommod which though useless to the god may be use to men 
in certain case socrat is here answer the question which he had 
himself rai about the proprieti of deceiv a madman and he is also 
contrast the natur of god and man for god is truth but mankind can 
onli be true by appear sometim to be partial or fal reserv 
for anoth place the greater question of religion or educ we 
may note further 1 the approv of the old tradit educ 
of greec 2 the prepar which plato is make for the attack on 
homer and the poet 3 the prepar which he is also make for the 
use of economi in the state 4 the contemptu and at the same time 
euphemist manner in which here a below he allud to the chroniqu 
scandaleu of the god 

book iii there is anoth motiv in purifi religion which is to 
banish fear for no man can be courag who is afraid of death or who 
belief the tale which are repeat by the poet concern the world 
below they must be gentli request not to abu hell they may be 
remind that their stori are both untru and discourag nor must 
they be angri if we expung obnoxi passag such a the depress 
word of achil i would rather be a serv man than rule over 
all the dead and the ver which tell of the squalid mansion the 
senseless shadow the flit soul mourn over lost strength and 
youth the soul with a gibber go beneath the earth like smoke or 
the soul of the suitor which flutter about like bat the terror and 
horror of cocytu and styx ghost and sapless shade and the rest 
of their tartarean nomenclatur must vanish such tale may have their 
use but they are not the proper food for soldier a littl can we 
admit the sorrow and sympathi of the homer hero achil the 
son of theti in tear throw ash on hi head or pace up and 
down the sea shore in distract or priam the cousin of the god 
cri aloud roll in the mire a good man is not prostrat at 
the loss of child or fortun neither is death terribl to him and 
therefor lament over the dead should not be practi by men of 
note they should be the concern of inferior person onli whether woman 
or men still wor is the attribut of such weak to the god a 
when the goddess say ala my travail and worst of all when the 
king of heaven himself lament hi inabl to save hector or sorrow 
over the impend doom of hi dear sarpedon such a charact of god 
if not ridicul by our young men is like to be imit by them 
nor should our citizen be given to excess of laughter such violent 
delight are follow by a violent re action the descript in the 
iliad of the god shake their side at the clumsi of hephaestu 
will not be admit by u certainli not 

truth should have a high place among the virtu for falsehood a 
we were say is useless to the god and onli use to men a a 
medicin but thi employ of falsehood must remain a privileg of 
state the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler ani 
more than the patient would tell a lie to hi physician or the sailor 
to hi captain 

in the next place our youth must be temper and temper consist 
in self control and obedi to author that is a lesson which homer 
teach in some place the achaean march on breath prowess in 
silent awe of their leader but a veri differ one in other place 
o heavi with wine who hast the eye of a dog but the heart of a 
stag languag of the latter kind will not impress self control on the 
mind of youth the same may be said about hi prai of eat and 
drink and hi dread of starvat also about the ver in which he 
tell of the raptur love of zeu and here or of how hephaestu onc 
detain are and aphrodit in a net on a similar occa there is a 
nobler strain heard in the word endur my soul thou hast endur 
wor nor must we allow our citizen to receiv bribe or to say 
gift persuad the god gift reverend king or to applaud the 
ignobl advic of phoenix to achil that he should get money out of 
the greek befor he assist them or the mean of achil himself 
in take gift from agamemnon or hi requir a ransom for the bodi 
of hector or hi cur of apollo or hi insol to the river god 
scamand or hi dedic to the dead patroclu of hi own hair which 
had been alreadi dedic to the other river god spercheiu or hi 
cruelti in drag the bodi of hector round the wall and slay 
the captiv at the pyre such a combin of mean and cruelti in 
cheiron s pupil is inconceiv the amatori exploit of peirith and 
theseu are equal unworthi either these so call son of god were 
not the son of god or they were not such a the poet imagin them 
ani more than the god themselv are the author of evil the youth who 
belief that such thing are done by those who have the blood of heaven 
flow in their vein will be too readi to imit their exampl 

enough of god and hero what shall we say about men what the poet 
and stori teller say that the wick prosper and the righteou are 
afflict or that justic is anoth s gain such misrepres 
cannot be allow by u but in thi we are anticip the definit 
of justic and had therefor better defer the enquiri 

the subject of poetri have been suffici treat next follow 
style now all poetri is a narr of event past present or to 
come and narr is of three kind the simpl the imit and 
a composit of the two an instanc will make my mean clear 
the first scene in homer is of the last or mix kind be partli 
descript and partli dialogu but if you throw the dialogu into the 
oratio obliqua the passag will run thu the priest came and pray 
apollo that the achaean might take troy and have a safe return if 
agamemnon would onli give him back hi daughter and the other greek 
assent but agamemnon wa wroth and so on the whole then becom 
descript and the poet is the onli speaker left or if you omit the 
narr the whole becom dialogu these are the three style which 
of them is to be admit into our state do you ask whether tragedi 
and comedi are to be admit ye but also someth more is it not 
doubt whether our guardian are to be imit at all or rather 
ha not the question been alreadi answer for we have decid that one 
man cannot in hi life play mani part ani more than he can act both 
tragedi and comedi or be rhapsodist and actor at onc human natur 
is coin into veri small piec and a our guardian have their own 
busi alreadi which is the care of freedom they will have enough 
to do without imit if they imit they should imit not ani 
mean or base but the good onli for the mask which the actor 
wear is apt to becom hi face we cannot allow men to play the part 
of woman quarrel weep scold or boast against the 
god least of all when make love or in labour they must not 
repr slave or bulli or coward drunkard or madman or 
blacksmith or neigh hor or bellow bull or sound river 
or a rage sea a good or wise man will be will to perform good and 
wise action but he will be asham to play an inferior part which he 
ha never practi and he will prefer to employ the descript style 
with a littl imit a possibl the man who ha no self respect 
on the contrari will imit anybodi and anyth sound of natur 
and cri of anim alik hi whole perform will be imit of 
gestur and voic now in the descript style there are few chang 
but in the dramat there are a great mani poet and musician use 
either or a compound of both and thi compound is veri attract 
to youth and their teacher a well a to the vulgar but our state in 
which one man play one part onli is not adapt for complex and 
when one of these polyphon pantomim gentleman offer to exhibit 
himself and hi poetri we will show him everi observ of respect 
but at the same time tell him that there is no room for hi kind in our 
state we prefer the rough honest poet and will not depart from our 
origin model law 

next a to the music a song or ode ha three part the subject the 
harmoni and the rhythm of which the two last are depend upon the 
first a we banish strain of lament so we may now banish the 
mix lydian harmoni which are the harmoni of lament and 
a our citizen are to be temper we may also banish convivi 
harmoni such a the ionian and pure lydian two remain the 
dorian and phrygian the first for war the second for peac the 
one express of courag the other of obedi or instruct or 
religi feel and a we reject varieti of harmoni we shall 
also reject the mani string variou shape instrument which give 
utter to them and in particular the flute which is more complex 
than ani of them the lyre and the harp may be permit in the town 
and the pan s pipe in the field thu we have made a purgat of 
music and will now make a purgat of metr these should be like the 
harmoni simpl and suitabl to the occa there are four note 
of the tetrachord and there are three ratio of metr 3 2 2 2 
2 1 which have all their characterist and the foot have differ 
characterist a well a the rhythm but about thi you and i must 
ask damon the great musician who speak if i rememb rightli of a 
martial measur a well a of dactyl trochaic and iambic rhythm 
which he arrang so a to equal the syllabl with one anoth 
assign to each the proper quantiti we onli ventur to affirm the 
gener principl that the style is to conform to the subject and the 
metr to the style and that the simplic and harmoni of the soul 
should be reflect in them all thi principl of simplic ha to 
be learnt by everi one in the day of hi youth and may be gather 
anywh from the creativ and construct art a well a from the 
form of plant and anim 

other artist a well a poet should be warn against mean or 
unseemli sculptur and paint equal with music must conform to 
the law of simplic he who violat it cannot be allow to work in 
our citi and to corrupt the tast of our citizen for our guardian 
must grow up not amid imag of deform which will gradual poison 
and corrupt their soul but in a land of health and beauti where they 
will drink in from everi object sweet and harmoni influenc and of 
all these influenc the greatest is the educ given by music 
which find a way into the innermost soul and impart to it the sen 
of beauti and of deform at first the effect is unconsci but when 
reason arriv then he who ha been thu train welcom her a the 
friend whom he alway knew a in learn to read first we acquir the 
element or letter separ and afterward their combin 
and cannot recogn reflect of them until we know the letter 
themselv in like manner we must first attain the element or 
essenti form of the virtu and then trace their combin in 
life and experi there is a music of the soul which answer to the 
harmoni of the world and the fairest object of a music soul is the 
fair mind in the fair bodi some defect in the latter may be excu 
but not in the former true love is the daughter of temper and 
temper is utterli oppo to the mad of bodili pleasur enough 
ha been said of music which make a fair end with love 

next we pa on to gymnast about which i would remark that the 
soul is relat to the bodi a a cau to an effect and therefor if we 
educ the mind we may leav the educ of the bodi in her charg 
and need onli give a gener outlin of the cour to be pursu in 
the first place the guardian must abstain from strong drink for they 
should be the last person to lose their wit whether the habit of 
the palaestra are suitabl to them is more doubt for the ordinari 
gymnast is a sleepi sort of thing and if left off suddenli is apt to 
endang health but our warrior athlet must be wide awak dog and 
must also be inur to all chang of food and climat henc they will 
requir a simpler kind of gymnast akin to their simpl music and for 
their diet a rule may be found in homer who feed hi hero on roast 
meat onli and give them no fish although they are live at the 
sea side nor boil meat which involv an apparatu of pot and pan 
and if i am not mistaken he nowher mention sweet sauc sicilian 
cookeri and attic confect and corinthian courtezan which are 
to gymnast what lydian and ionian melodi are to music must be 
forbidden where gluttoni and intemp prevail the town quickli 
fill with doctor and pleader and law and medicin give themselv 
air a soon a the freeman of a state take an interest in them but 
what can show a more disgrac state of educ than to have to go 
abroad for justic becau you have none of your own at home and yet 
there is a wor stage of the same disea when men have learn 
to take a pleasur and pride in the twist and turn of the law not 
consid how much better it would be for them so to order their life 
a to have no need of a nod justic and there is a like disgrac in 
employ a physician not for the cure of wound or epidem disord 
but becau a man ha by lazi and luxuri contract disea 
which were unknown in the day of asclepiu how simpl is the homer 
practic of medicin eurypylu after he ha been wound drink a 
posset of pramnian wine which is of a heat natur and yet the 
son of asclepiu blame neither the damsel who give him the drink nor 
patroclu who is attend on him the truth is that thi modern system 
of nur disea wa introduc by herodicu the trainer who 
be of a sickli constitut by a compound of train and medicin 
tortur first himself and then a good mani other peopl and live 
a great deal longer than he had ani right but asclepiu would not 
practi thi art becau he knew that the citizen of a well order 
state have no leisur to be ill and therefor he adopt the kill 
or cure method which artisan and labour employ they must be 
at their busi they say and have no time for coddl if they 
recov well if they don t there is an end of them wherea the rich 
man is suppo to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill do you know 
a maxim of phocylid that when a man begin to be rich or perhap 
a littl sooner he should practi virtu but how can excess 
care of health be inconsist with an ordinari occup and yet 
consist with that practic of virtu which phocylid inculc 
when a student imago that philosophi give him a headach he never 
doe anyth he is alway unwel thi wa the reason whi asclepiu 
and hi son practi no such art they were act in the interest of 
the public and did not wish to preserv useless life or rai up a 
puni offspr to wretch sire honest disea they honestli cure 
and if a man wa wound they appli the proper remedi and then let 
him eat and drink what he like but they declin to treat intemp 
and worthless subject even though they might have made larg fortun 
out of them a to the stori of pindar that asclepiu wa slain by a 
thunderbolt for restor a rich man to life that is a lie follow 
our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribe or that he 
wa not the son of a god 

glaucon then ask socrat whether the best physician and the best 
judg will not be those who have had sever the greatest experi 
of disea and of crime socrat draw a distinct between the two 
profess the physician should have had experi of disea in 
hi own bodi for he cure with hi mind and not with hi bodi but 
the judg control mind by mind and therefor hi mind should not be 
corrupt by crime where then is he to gain experi how is he to be 
wise and also innoc when young a good man is apt to be deceiv by 
evil doer becau he ha no pattern of evil in himself and therefor 
the judg should be of a certain age hi youth should have been 
innoc and he should have acquir insight into evil not by the 
practic of it but by the observ of it in other thi is 
the ideal of a judg the crimin turn detect is wonder 
suspici but when in compani with good men who have experi he is 
at fault for he foolishli imago that everi one is a bad a himself 
vice may be known of virtu but cannot know virtu thi is the sort of 
medicin and thi the sort of law which will prevail in our state they 
will be heal art to better natur but the evil bodi will be left 
to die by the one and the evil soul will be put to death by the other 
and the need of either will be greatli diminish by good music which 
will give harmoni to the soul and good gymnast which will give 
health to the bodi not that thi divi of music and gymnast realli 
correspond to soul and bodi for they are both equal concern with 
the soul which is tame by the one and arou and sustain by the 
other the two togeth suppli our guardian with their twofold natur 
the passion disposit when it ha too much gymnast is harden 
and brutal the gentl or philosoph temper which ha too much 
music becom enerv while a man is allow music to pour like 
water through the funnel of hi ear the edg of hi soul gradual 
wear away and the passion or spirit element is melt out of 
him too littl spirit is easili exhaust too much quickli pa into 
nervou irrit so again the athlet by feed and train ha 
hi courag doubl but he soon grow stupid he is like a wild beast 
readi to do everyth by blow and noth by counsel or polici there 
are two principl in man reason and passion and to these not to the 
soul and bodi the two art of music and gymnast correspond he who 
mingl them in harmoni concord is the true musician he shall be 
the presid geniu of our state 

the next question is who are to be our ruler first the elder must 
rule the younger and the best of the elder will be the best guardian 
now they will be the best who love their subject most and think that 
they have a common interest with them in the welfar of the state these 
we must select but they must be watch at everi epoch of life to see 
whether they have retain the same opinion and held out against forc 
and enchant for time and persua and the love of pleasur may 
enchant a man into a chang of purpo and the forc of grief and pain 
may compel him and therefor our guardian must be men who have been 
tri by mani test like gold in the refin s fire and have been 
pa first through danger then through pleasur and at everi age 
have come out of such trial victori and without stain in full 
command of themselv and their principl have all their faculti 
in harmoni exerci for their countri s good these shall receiv the 
highest honour both in life and death it would perhap be better to 
confin the term guardian to thi select class the younger men may 
be call auxiliari 

and now for one magnif lie in the belief of which oh that we 
could train our ruler at ani rate let u make the attempt with the 
rest of the world what i am go to tell is onli anoth version of 
the legend of cadmu but our unbeliev gener will be slow to 
accept such a stori the tale must be impart first to the ruler 
then to the soldier lastli to the peopl we will inform them that 
their youth wa a dream and that dure the time when they seem to 
be undergo their educ they were realli be fashion in the 
earth who sent them up when they were readi and that they must protect 
and cherish her whose child they are and regard each other a 
brother and sister i do not wonder at your be asham to propound 
such a fiction there is more behind these brother and sister 
have differ natur and some of them god frame to rule whom he 
fashion of gold other he made of silver to be auxiliari other 
again to be husbandman and craftsman and these were form by him of 
brass and iron but a they are all sprung from a common stock a golden 
parent may have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and then 
there must be a chang of rank the son of the rich must descend and 
the child of the artisan rise in the social scale for an oracl say 
that the state will come to an end if govern by a man of brass or 
iron will our citizen ever believ all thi not in the present 
gener but in the next perhap ye 

now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their ruler 
and look about and pitch their camp in a high place which will be safe 
against enemi from without and likewi against insurrect from 
within there let them sacrif and set up their tent for soldier 
they are to be and not shopkeep the watchdog and guardian of the 
sheep and luxuri and avar will turn them into wolf and tyrant 
their habit and their dwell should correspond to their educ 
they should have no properti their pay should onli meet their expen 
and they should have common meal gold and silver we will tell them 
that they have from god and thi divin gift in their soul they must 
not alloy with that earthli dross which pa under the name of gold 
they onli of the citizen may not touch it or be under the same roof 
with it or drink from it it is the accur thing should they 
ever acquir hou or land or money of their own they will becom 
household and tradesman instead of guardian enemi and tyrant 
instead of helper and the hour of ruin both to themselv and the 
rest of the state will be at hand 

the religi and ethic aspect of plato s educ will hereaft 
be consid under a separ head some lesser point may be more 
conveni notic in thi place 

1 the constant appeal to the author of homer whom with grave 
ironi plato after the manner of hi age summon a a wit about 
ethic and psycholog a well a about diet and medicin attempt 
to distinguish the better lesson from the wor sometim alter 
the text from design more than onc quot or allud to homer 
inaccur after the manner of the earli logograph turn the 
iliad into prose and delight to draw far fetch infer from 
hi word or to make ludicr applic of them he doe not like 
heracleitu get into a rage with homer and archilochu heracl but 
u their word and express a vehicl of a higher truth not on 
a system like theagen of rhegium or metrodoru or in later time the 
stoic but a fanci may dictat and the conclu drawn from them 
are sound although the premi are fictiti these fanci appeal 
to homer add a charm to plato s style and at the same time they have 
the effect of a satir on the folli of homer interpret to u 
and probabl to himself although they take the form of argument 
they are realli figur of speech they may be compar with modern 
citat from scriptur which have often a great rhetor power even 
when the origin mean of the word is entir lost sight of the 
real like the platon socrat a we gather from the memorabilia of 
xenophon wa fond of make similar adapt great in all age and 
countri in religion a well a in law and literatur ha been the 
art of interpret 

2 the style is to conform to the subject and the metr to the style 
notwithstand the fascin which the word classic exerci 
over u we can hardli maintain that thi rule is observ in all the 
greek poetri which ha come down to u we cannot deni that the thought 
often exc the power of lucid express in aeschylu and pindar 
or that rhetor get the better of the thought in the sophist poet 
euripid onli perhap in sophocl is there a perfect harmoni of the 
two in him alon do we find a grace of languag like the beauti of a 
greek statu in which there is noth to add or to take away at 
least thi is true of singl play or of larg portion of them the 
connect in the tragic choru and in the greek lyric poet is not 
unfrequ a tangl thread which in an age befor logic the poet wa 
unabl to draw out mani thought and feel mingl in hi mind and 
he had no power of disengag or arrang them for there is a subtl 
influenc of logic which requir to be transfer from prose to 
poetri just a the music and perfect of languag are infu by 
poetri into prose in all age the poet ha been a bad judg of hi 
own mean apol for he doe not see that the word which is full 
of associ to hi own mind is difficult and unmean to that of 
anoth or that the sequenc which is clear to himself is puzzl to 
other there are mani passag in some of our greatest modern poet 
which are far too obscur in which there is no proport between style 
and subject in which ani half express figur ani harsh construct 
ani distort colloc of word ani remot sequenc of idea is 
admit and there is no voic come sweetli from natur or music 
ad the express of feel to thought a if there could be poetri 
without beauti or beauti without ea and clear the obscur 
of earli greek poet aro necessarili out of the state of languag and 
logic which exist in their age they are not exampl to be follow 
by u for the use of languag ought in everi gener to becom 
clearer and clearer like shakesp they were great in spite not 
in consequ of their imperfect of express but there is no 
reason for return to the necessari obscur which prevail in 
the infanc of literatur the english poet of the last centuri were 
certainli not obscur and we have no excu for lose what they had 
gain or for go back to the earlier or transit age which 
prece them the thought of our own time ha not out strip 
languag a want of plato s art of measur is the rule cau of the 
disproport between them 

3 in the third book of the republ a nearer approach is made to a 
theori of art than anywh el in plato hi view may be sum up 
a follow true art is not fanci and imit but simpl and 
ideal the express of the highest moral energi whether in action or 
repo to live among work of plastic art which are of thi nobl 
and simpl charact or to listen to such strain is the best of 
influenc the true greek atmosph in which youth should be brought 
up that is the way to creat in them a natur good tast which will 
have a feel of truth and beauti in all thing for though the 
poet are to be expel still art is recogn a anoth aspect of 
reason like love in the symposium extend over the same sphere but 
confin to the preliminari educ and act through the power of 
habit and thi concept of art is not limit to strain of music or 
the form of plastic art but pervad all natur and ha a wide kindr 
in the world the republ of plato like the athen of pericl ha an 
artist a well a a polit side 

there is hardli ani mention in plato of the creativ art onli in two 
or three passag doe he even allud to them rep soph he is 
not lost in raptur at the great work of phidia the parthenon the 
propylea the statu of zeu or athen he would probabl have regard 
ani abstract truth of number or figur a higher than the greatest of 
them yet it is hard to suppo that some influenc such a he hope to 
inspir in youth did not pa into hi own mind from the work of art 
which he saw around him we are live upon the fragment of them and 
find in a few broken stone the standard of truth and beauti but in 
plato thi feel ha no express he nowher say that beauti is the 
object of art he seem to deni that wisdom can take an extern form 
phaedru he doe not distinguish the fine from the mechan art 
whether or no like some writer he felt more than he express it 
is at ani rate remark that the greatest perfect of the fine art 
should coincid with an almost entir silenc about them in one veri 
strike passag he tell u that a work of art like the state is a 
whole and thi concept of a whole and the love of the newli born 
mathemat scienc may be regard if not a the inspir at ani 
rate a the regul principl of greek art xen mem and sophist 

4 plato make the true and subtl remark that the physician had better 
not be in robust health and should have known what ill is in hi 
own person but the judg ought to have had no similar experi of 
evil he is to be a good man who have pa hi youth in innoc 
becam acquaint late in life with the vice of other and therefor 
accord to plato a judg should not be young just a a young man 
accord to aristotl is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophi 
the bad on the other hand have a knowledg of vice but no knowledg 
of virtu it may be doubt howev whether thi train of reflect 
is well found in a remark passag of the law it is acknowledg 
that the evil may form a correct estim of the good the union of 
gentl and courag in book ii at first seem to be a paradox 
yet wa afterward ascertain to be a truth and plato might also have 
found that the intuit of evil may be consist with the abhorr 
of it there is a direct of aim in virtu which give an insight 
into vice and the knowledg of charact is in some degr a natur 
sen independ of ani special experi of good or evil 

5 one of the most remark concept of plato becau un greek and 
also veri differ from anyth which exist at all in hi age of 
the world is the transposit of rank in the spartan state there had 
been enfranchi of helot and degrad of citizen under 
special circumst and in the ancient greek aristocraci merit 
wa certainli recogn a one of the element on which govern wa 
base the founder of state were suppo to be their benefactor who 
were rai by their great action abov the ordinari level of human 
at a later period the servic of warrior and legisl were held to 
entitl them and their descend to the privileg of citizenship and 
to the first rank in the state and although the exist of an ideal 
aristocraci is slenderli proven from the remain of earli greek histori 
and we have a difficulti in ascrib such a charact howev the idea 
may be defin to ani actual hellen state or ind to ani state 
which ha ever exist in the world still the rule of the best wa 
certainli the aspir of philosoph who probabl accommod a 
good deal their view of primit histori to their own notion of good 
govern plato further insist on appli to the guardian of hi 
state a seri of test by which all those who fell short of a fix 
standard were either remov from the govern bodi or not admit 
to it and thi academ disciplin did to a certain extent prevail in 
greek state especi in sparta he also indic that the system of 
cast which exist in a great part of the ancient and is by no mean 
extinct in the modern european world should be set asid from time 
to time in favour of merit he is awar how deepli the greater part of 
mankind resent ani interf with the order of societi and therefor 
he propo hi novel idea in the form of what he himself call a 
monstrou fiction compar the ceremoni of prepar for the two 
great wave in book v two principl are indic by him first 
that there is a distinct of rank depend on circumst prior to 
the individu second that thi distinct is and ought to be broken 
through by person qualiti he adapt mytholog like the homer 
poem to the want of the state make the phoenician tale the 
vehicl of hi idea everi greek state had a myth respect it own 
origin the platon republ may also have a tale of earthborn men the 
graviti and verisimilitud with which the tale is told and the analog 
of greek tradit are a suffici verif of the monstrou 
falsehood ancient poetri had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and 
iron age succeed one anoth but plato suppo these differ 
in the natur of men to exist togeth in a singl state mytholog 
suppli a figur under which the lesson may be taught a protagora 
say the myth is more interest and also enabl plato to touch 
lightli on new principl without go into detail in thi passag he 
shadow forth a gener truth but he doe not tell u by what step the 
transposit of rank is to be effect ind throughout the republ 
he allow the lower rank to fade into the distanc we do not know 
whether they are to carri arm and whether in the fifth book they are 
or are not includ in the communist regul respect properti 
and marriag nor is there ani use in argu strictli either from a 
few chanc word or from the silenc of plato or in draw infer 
which were beyond hi vision aristotl in hi critic on the 
posit of the lower class doe not perceiv that the poetic 
creation is like the air invuln and cannot be penetr by 
the shaft of hi logic pol 

6 two paradox which strike the modern reader a in the highest degr 
fanci and ideal and which suggest to him mani reflect are to 
be found in the third book of the republ first the great power of 
music so much beyond ani influenc which is experienc by u in modern 
time when the art or scienc ha been far more develop and ha 
found the secret of harmoni a well a of melodi secondli the 
indefinit and almost absolut control which the soul is suppo to 
exerci over the bodi 

in the first we suspect some degr of exagg such a we may 
also observ among certain master of the art not unknown to u at the 
present day with thi natur enthusiasm which is felt by a few onli 
there seem to mingl in plato a sort of pythagorean rever for 
number and numer proport to which aristotl is a stranger 
interv of sound and number are to him sacr thing which have a law 
of their own not depend on the variat of sen they rise abov 
sen and becom a connect link with the world of idea but it is 
evid that plato is describ what to him appear to be also a fact 
the power of a simpl and characterist melodi on the impress 
mind of the greek is more than we can easili appreci the effect of 
nation air may bear some comparison with it and besid all thi 
there is a confu between the harmoni of music note and the 
harmoni of soul and bodi which is so potent inspir by them 

the second paradox lead up to some curiou and interest 
question how far can the mind control the bodi is the relat 
between them one of mutual antagon or of mutual harmoni are they 
two or one and is either of them the cau of the other may we not at 
time drop the opposit between them and the mode of describ them 
which is so familiar to u and yet hardli convey ani preci mean 
and tri to view thi composit creatur man in a more simpl manner 
must we not at ani rate admit that there is in human natur a higher 
and a lower principl divid by no distinct line which at time 
break asund and take up arm against one anoth or again they are 
reconcil and move togeth either unconsci in the ordinari work 
of life or consciou in the pursuit of some nobl aim to be attain 
not without an effort and for which everi thought and nerv are 
strain and then the bodi becom the good friend or alli or servant 
or instrument of the mind and the mind ha often a wonder and almost 
superhuman power of banish disea and weak and call out a 
hidden strength reason and the desir the intellect and the sen 
are brought into harmoni and obedi so a to form a singl human 
be they are ever part ever meet and the ident or 
diver of their tendenc or oper is for the most part 
unnot by u when the mind touch the bodi through the appetit 
we acknowledg the respon of the one to the other there is a 
tendenc in u which say drink there is anoth which say do 
not drink it is not good for you and we all of u know which is the 
right superior we are also respon for our health although into 
thi sphere there enter some element of necess which may be beyond 
our control still even in the manag of health care and thought 
continu over mani year may make u almost free agent if we do 
not exact too much of ourselv and if we acknowledg that all human 
freedom is limit by the law of natur and of mind 

we are disappoint to find that plato in the gener condemn 
which he pa on the practic of medicin prevail in hi own day 
depreci the effect of diet he would like to have disea of a 
definit charact and capabl of receiv a definit treatment he is 
afraid of invalid interf with the busi of life he doe 
not recogn that time is the great healer both of mental and bodili 
disord and that remedi which are gradual and proceed littl by 
littl are safer than those which produc a sudden catastroph neither 
doe he see that there is no way in which the mind can more sure 
influenc the bodi than by the control of eat and drink or ani 
other action or occa of human life on which the higher freedom of 
the will can be more simpl or truli assert 

7 lesser matter of style may be remark 

1 the affect ignor of music which is plato s way of express 
that he is pa lightli over the subject 

2 the tent manner in which here a in the second book he 
proce with the construct of the state 

3 the descript of the state sometim a a realiti and then again 
a a work of imagin onli these are the art by which he sustain 
the reader s interest 

4 connect link or the prepar for the entir expul of the 
poet in book x 

5 the companion pictur of the lover of litig and the 
valetudinarian the satir jest about the maxim of phocylid the 
manner in which the imag of the gold and silver citizen is taken 
up into the subject and the argument from the practic of asclepiu 
should not escap notic 

book iv adeimantu said suppo a person to argu socrat that you 
make your citizen miser and thi by their own free will they are 
the lord of the citi and yet instead of have like other men land 
and hou and money of their own they live a mercenari and are 
alway mount guard you may add i repli that they receiv no 
pay but onli their food and have no money to spend on a journey or a 
mistress well and what answer do you give my answer is that 
our guardian may or may not be the happiest of men i should not be 
surpri to find in the long run that they were but thi is not the 
aim of our constitut which wa design for the good of the whole 
and not of ani one part if i went to a sculptor and blame him for 
have paint the eye which is the noblest featur of the face not 
purpl but black he would repli the eye must be an eye and you 
should look at the statu a a whole now i can well imagin a fool s 
paradi in which everybodi is eat and drink cloth in purpl 
and fine linen and potter lie on sofa and have their wheel at hand 
that they may work a littl when they plea and cobbler and all the 
other class of a state lose their distinct charact and a state 
may get on without cobbler but when the guardian degen into boon 
companion then the ruin is complet rememb that we are not talk 
of peasant keep holiday but of a state in which everi man is 
expect to do hi own work the happi resid not in thi or that 
class but in the state a a whole i have anoth remark to make a 
middl condit is best for artisan they should have money enough to 
buy tool and not enough to be independ of busi and will not 
the same condit be best for our citizen if they are poor they will 
be mean if rich luxuri and lazi and in neither case content 
but then how will our poor citi be abl to go to war against an enemi 
who ha money there may be a difficulti in fight against one enemi 
against two there will be none in the first place the contest will be 
carri on by train warrior against well to do citizen and is not a 
regular athlet an easi match for two stout oppon at least suppo 
also that befor engag we send ambassador to one of the two citi 
say silver and gold we have not do you help u and take our share 
of the spoil who would fight against the lean wiri dog when they 
might join with them in prey upon the fat sheep but if mani 
state join their resourc shall we not be in danger i am amu 
to hear you use the word state of ani but our own state they are 
state but not a state mani in one for in everi state there are 
two hostil nation rich and poor which you may set one against the 
other but our state while she remain true to her principl will be 
in veri deed the mightiest of hellen state 

to the size of the state there is no limit but the necess of uniti 
it must be neither too larg nor too small to be one thi is a matter 
of secondari import like the principl of transposit which wa 
intim in the parabl of the earthborn men the mean there impli 
wa that everi man should do that for which he wa fit and be at 
one with himself and then the whole citi would be unit but all these 
thing are secondari if educ which is the great matter be duli 
regard when the wheel ha onc been set in motion the speed is 
alway increa and each gener improv upon the prece both 
in physic and moral qualiti the care of the governor should be 
direct to preserv music and gymnast from innov alter the 
song of a countri damon say and you will soon end by alter it 
law the chang appear innoc at first and begin in play but 
the evil soon becom seriou work secretli upon the charact of 
individu then upon social and commerci relat and lastli upon 
the institut of a state and there is ruin and confu everywh 
but if educ remain in the establish form there will be no 
danger a restor process will be alway go on the spirit of law 
and order will rai up what ha fallen down nor will ani regul 
be need for the lesser matter of life rule of deport or 
fashion of dress like invit like for good or for evil educ 
will correct defici and suppli the power of self govern far 
be it from u to enter into the particular of legisl let the 
guardian take care of educ and educ will take care of all 
other thing 

but without educ they may patch and mend a they plea they will 
make no progress ani more than a patient who think to cure himself by 
some favourit remedi and will not give up hi luxuri mode of live 
if you tell such person that they must first alter their habit then 
they grow angri they are charm peopl charm nay the veri 
rever evid these gentleman are not in your good grace nor the 
state which is like them and such state there are which first ordain 
under penalti of death that no one shall alter the constitut and 
then suffer themselv to be flatter into and out of anyth and 
he who indulg them and fawn upon them is their leader and saviour 
ye the men are a bad a the state but do you not admir their 
clever nay some of them are stupid enough to believ what the 
peopl tell them and when all the world is tell a man that he is 
six foot high and he ha no measur how can he believ anyth 
el but don t get into a passion to see our statesman tri their 
nostrum and fanci that they can cut off at a blow the hydra like 
rogueri of mankind is a good a a play minut enact are 
superflu in good state and are useless in bad one 

and now what remain of the work of legisl noth for u but to 
apollo the god of delphi we leav the order of the greatest of all 
thing that is to say religion onli our ancestr deiti sit upon 
the centr and navel of the earth will be trust by u if we have ani 
sen in an affair of such magnitud no foreign god shall be suprem 
in our realm 

here a socrat would say let u reflect on greek what ha 
prece thu far we have spoken not of the happi of the citizen 
but onli of the well be of the state they may be the happiest of 
men but our princip aim in found the state wa not to make them 
happi they were to be guardian not holiday maker in thi pleasant 
manner is present to u the famou question both of ancient and modern 
philosophi touch the relat of duti to happi of right to 
util 

first duti then happi is the natur order of our moral idea the 
utilitarian principl is valuabl a a correct of error and show 
to u a side of ethic which is apt to be neglect it may be admit 
further that right and util are co exten and that he who make 
the happi of mankind hi object ha one of the highest and noblest 
motif of human action but util is not the histor basi of 
moral nor the aspect in which moral and religi idea commonli 
occur to the mind the greatest happi of all is a we believ the 
far off result of the divin govern of the univ the greatest 
happi of the individu is certainli to be found in a life of virtu 
and good but we seem to be more assur of a law of right than we 
can be of a divin purpo that all mankind should be save and 
we infer the one from the other and the greatest happi of the 
individu may be the rever of the greatest happi in the ordinari 
sen of the term and may be reali in a life of pain or in a 
voluntari death further the word happi ha sever ambigu 
it may mean either pleasur or an ideal life happi subject or 
object in thi world or in anoth of ourselv onli or of 
our neighbour and of all men everywh by the modern founder of 
utilitarian the self regard and disinterest motif of action 
are includ under the same term although they are commonli oppo 
by u a benevol and self love the word happi ha not the 
definit or the sacr of truth and right it doe 
not equal appeal to our higher natur and ha not sunk into the 
conscienc of mankind it is associ too much with the comfort and 
conveni of life too littl with the good of the soul which we 
desir for their own sake in a great trial or danger or temptat 
or in ani great and heroic action it is scarc thought of for these 
reason the greatest happi principl is not the true foundat of 
ethic but though not the first principl it is the second which is 
like unto it and is often of easier applic for the larger part of 
human action are neither right nor wrong except in so far a they tend 
to the happi of mankind introd to gorgia and philebu 

the same question reappear in polit where the use or expedi 
seem to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater author for 
concern polit measur we chiefli ask how will they affect 
the happi of mankind yet here too we may observ that what we term 
expedi is mere the law of right limit by the condit of human 
societi right and truth are the highest aim of govern a well a 
of individu and we ought not to lose sight of them becau we cannot 
directli enforc them they appeal to the better mind of nation and 
sometim they are too much for mere tempor interest to resist 
they are the watchword which all men use in matter of public polici 
a well a in their privat deal the peac of europ may be said 
to depend upon them in the most commerci and utilitarian state 
of societi the power of idea remain and all the higher class of 
statesman have in them someth of that ideal which pericl is said 
to have gather from the teach of anaxagora they recogni that 
the true leader of men must be abov the motif of ambit and 
that nation charact is of greater valu than materi comfort and 
prosper and thi is the order of thought in plato first he expect 
hi citizen to do their duti and then under favour circumst 
that is to say in a well order state their happi is assur 
that he wa far from exclud the modern principl of util in 
polit is suffici evid from other passag in which the most 
benefici is affirm to be the most honour and also the most 
sacr 

we may note 

1 the manner in which the object of adeimantu here is design to 
draw out and deepen the argument of socrat 

2 the concept of a whole a lie at the foundat both of 
polit and of art in the latter suppli the onli principl of 
critic which under the variou name of harmoni symmetri measur 
proport uniti the greek seem to have appli to work of art 

3 the requir that the state should be limit in size after the 
tradit model of a greek state a in the polit of aristotl the 
fact that the citi of hella were small is convert into a principl 

4 the humor pictur of the lean dog and the fat sheep of 
the light activ boxer upset two stout gentleman at least of the 
charm patient who are alway make themselv wor or again 
the play assumpt that there is no state but our own or the grave 
ironi with which the statesman is excu who belief that he is six 
foot high becau he is told so and have noth to measur with 
is to be pardon for hi ignor he is too amu for u to be 
seriou angri with him 

5 the light and superfici manner in which religion is pa over 
when provi ha been made for two great principl first that 
religion shall be base on the highest concept of the god secondli 
that the true nation or hellen type shall be maintain 

socrat proce but where amid all thi is justic son of ariston 
tell me where light a candl and search the citi and get your brother 
and the rest of our friend to help in seek for her that won t do 
repli glaucon you yourself promi to make the search and talk 
about the impieti of desert justic well i said i will lead the 
way but do you follow my notion is that our state be perfect will 
contain all the four virtu wisdom courag temper justic if 
we elimin the three first the unknown remaind will be justic 

first then of wisdom the state which we have call into be will be 
wise becau polit and polici is one among mani kind of skill not 
the skill of the carpent or of the worker in metal or of the 
husbandman but the skill of him who advi about the interest of the 
whole state of such a kind is the skill of the guardian who are a 
small class in number far smaller than the blacksmith but in them 
is concentr the wisdom of the state and if thi small rule class 
have wisdom then the whole state will be wise 

our second virtu is courag which we have no difficulti in find 
in anoth class that of soldier courag may be defin a a sort 
of salvat the never fail salvat of the opinion which law and 
educ have prescrib concern danger you know the way in which 
dyer first prepar the white ground and then lay on the dye of purpl 
or of ani other colour colour dy in thi way becom fix and no 
soap or lye will ever wash them out now the ground is educ and 
the law are the colour and if the ground is properli laid neither 
the soap of pleasur nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them 
out thi power which preserv right opinion about danger i would ask 
you to call courag ad the epithet polit or civil 
in order to distinguish it from mere anim courag and from a higher 
courag which may hereaft be discu 

two virtu remain temper and justic more than the prece 
virtu temper suggest the idea of harmoni some light is thrown 
upon the natur of thi virtu by the popular descript of a man a 
master of himself which ha an absurd sound becau the master is 
also the servant the express realli mean that the better principl 
in a man master the wor there are in citi whole class woman 
slave and the like who correspond to the wor and a few onli to the 
better and in our state the former class are held under control by the 
latter now to which of these class doe temper belong to both 
of them and our state if ani will be the abod of temper and 
we were right in describ thi virtu a a harmoni which is diffu 
through the whole make the dweller in the citi to be of one mind 
and attun the upper and middl and lower class like the string of 
an instrument whether you suppo them to differ in wisdom strength or 
wealth 

and now we are near the spot let u draw in and surround the cover and 
watch with all our eye lest justic should slip away and escap tell 
me if you see the thicket move first nay i would have you lead 
well then offer up a prayer and follow the way is dark and difficult 
but we must push on i begin to see a track good news whi glaucon 
our dul of scent is quit ludicr while we are strain our eye 
into the distanc justic is tumbl out at our foot we are a bad 
a peopl look for a thing which they have in their hand have you 
forgotten our old principl of the divi of labour or of everi man 
do hi own busi concern which we spoke at the foundat 
of the state what but thi wa justic is there ani other virtu 
remain which can compet with wisdom and temper and courag in 
the scale of polit virtu for everi one have hi own is the 
great object of govern and the great object of trade is that 
everi man should do hi own busi not that there is much harm in a 
carpent tri to be a cobbler or a cobbler transform himself into 
a carpent but great evil may ari from the cobbler leav hi last 
and turn into a guardian or legisl or when a singl individu 
is trainer warrior legisl all in one and thi evil is injust 
or everi man do anoth s busi i do not say that a yet we are 
in a condit to arriv at a final conclu for the definit 
which we believ to hold good in state ha still to be test by the 
individu have read the larg letter we will now come back to the 
small from the two togeth a brilliant light may be struck out 

socrat proce to discov the natur of justic by a method of 
residu each of the first three virtu correspond to one of the 
three part of the soul and one of the three class in the state 
although the third temper ha more of the natur of a harmoni than 
the first two if there be a fourth virtu that can onli be sought for 
in the relat of the three part in the soul or class in the state 
to one anoth it is obviou and simpl and for that veri reason ha 
not been found out the modern logician will be inclin to object that 
idea cannot be separ like chemic substanc but that they run 
into one anoth and may be onli differ aspect or name of the 
same thing and such in thi instanc appear to be the case for the 
definit here given of justic is verbal the same a one of the 
definit of temper given by socrat in the charmid which 
howev is onli provis and is afterward reject and so far 
from justic remain over when the other virtu are elimin 
the justic and temper of the republ can with difficulti be 
distinguish temper appear to be the virtu of a part onli and 
one of three wherea justic is a univ virtu of the whole soul 
yet on the other hand temper is also describ a a sort of harmoni 
and in thi respect is akin to justic justic seem to differ from 
temper in degr rather than in kind wherea temper is the 
harmoni of discord element justic is the perfect order by which 
all natur and class do their own busi the right man in the 
right place the divi and co oper of all the citizen justic 
again is a more abstract notion than the other virtu and therefor 
from plato s point of view the foundat of them to which they 
are refer and which in idea prece them the propo to omit 
temper is a mere trick of style intend to avoid monotoni 

there is a famou question discu in one of the earlier dialogu of 
plato protagora arist nic ethic whether the virtu are one 
or mani thi receiv an answer which is to the effect that there 
are four cardin virtu now for the first time brought togeth in 
ethic philosophi and one suprem over the rest which is not like 
aristotl s concept of univ justic virtu rel to other 
but the whole of virtu rel to the part to thi univ 
concept of justic or order in the first educ and in the moral 
natur of man the still more univ concept of the good in the 
second educ and in the sphere of specul knowledg seem to 
succeed both might be equal describ by the term law order 
harmoni but while the idea of good embrac all time and all 
exist the concept of justic is not extend beyond man 

socrat is now go to identifi the individu and the state but 
first he must prove that there are three part of the individu soul 
hi argument is a follow quantiti make no differ in qualiti 
the word just whether appli to the individu or to the state ha 
the same mean and the term justic impli that the same three 
principl in the state and in the individu were do their own 
busi but are they realli three or one the question is difficult 
and one which can hardli be solv by the method which we are now 
use but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time 
the shorter will satisfi me well then you would admit that the 
qualiti of state mean the qualiti of the individu who compo 
them the scythian and thracian are passion our own race 
intellectu and the egyptian and phoenician covet becau 
the individu member of each have such and such a charact the 
difficulti is to determin whether the sever principl are one or 
three whether that is to say we reason with one part of our natur 
desir with anoth are angri with anoth or whether the whole soul 
come into play in each sort of action thi enquiri howev requir 
a veri exact definit of term the same thing in the same relat 
cannot be affect in two opposit way but there is no imposs 
in a man stand still yet move hi arm or in a top which is fix 
on one spot go round upon it axi there is no necess to mention 
all the possibl except let u provis assum that opposit 
cannot do or be or suffer opposit in the same relat and to the 
class of opposit belong assent and dissent desir and avoid 
and one form of desir is thirst and hunger and here ari a new 
point thirst is thirst of drink hunger is hunger of food not of warm 
drink or of a particular kind of food with the singl except of 
cour that the veri fact of our desir anyth impli that it is 
good when rel term have no attribut their correl have 
no attribut when they have attribut their correl also have 
them for exampl the term greater is simpli rel to le and 
knowledg refer to a subject of knowledg but on the other hand a 
particular knowledg is of a particular subject again everi scienc 
ha a distinct charact which is defin by an object medicin for 
exampl is the scienc of health although not to be confound with 
health have clear our idea thu far let u return to the origin 
instanc of thirst which ha a definit object drink now the thirsti 
soul may feel two distinct impul the anim one say drink 
the ration one which say do not drink the two impul are 
contradictori and therefor we may assum that they spring from 
distinct principl in the soul but is passion a third principl or 
akin to desir there is a stori of a certain leontiu which throw some 
light on thi question he wa come up from the piraeu outsid the 
north wall and he pa a spot where there were dead bodi lie 
by the execut he felt a long desir to see them and also an 
abhorr of them at first he turn away and shut hi eye then 
suddenli tear them open he said take your fill ye wretch of 
the fair sight now is there not here a third principl which is often 
found to come to the assist of reason against desir but never 
of desir against reason thi is passion or spirit of the separ 
exist of which we may further convinc ourselv by put the 
follow case when a man suffer justli if he be of a gener 
natur he is not indign at the hardship which he undergo but when 
he suffer unjustli hi indign is hi great support hunger and 
thirst cannot tame him the spirit within him must do or die until the 
voic of the shepherd that is of reason bid hi dog bark no 
more is heard within thi show that passion is the alli of reason is 
passion then the same with reason no for the former exist in child 
and brute and homer afford a proof of the distinct between them 
when he say he smote hi breast and thu rebuk hi soul 

and now at last we have reach firm ground and are abl to infer 
that the virtu of the state and of the individu are the same for 
wisdom and courag and justic in the state are sever the wisdom and 
courag and justic in the individu who form the state each of the 
three class will do the work of it own class in the state and each 
part in the individu soul reason the superior and passion the 
inferior will be harmon by the influenc of music and gymnast 
the counsellor and the warrior the head and the arm will act togeth 
in the town of mansoul and keep the desir in proper subject the 
courag of the warrior is that qualiti which preserv a right opinion 
about danger in spite of pleasur and pain the wisdom of the 
counsellor is that small part of the soul which ha author and 
reason the virtu of temper is the friendship of the rule and the 
subject principl both in the state and in the individu of justic 
we have alreadi spoken and the notion alreadi given of it may 
be confirm by common instanc will the just state or the just 
individu steal lie commit adulteri or be guilti of impieti to 
god and men no and is not the reason of thi that the sever 
principl whether in the state or in the individu do their own 
busi and justic is the qualiti which make just men and just 
state moreov our old divi of labour which requir that there 
should be one man for one use wa a dream or anticip of what wa 
to follow and that dream ha now been realiz in justic which 
begin by bind togeth the three chord of the soul and then act 
harmoni in everi relat of life and injust which is the 
insubordin and disobedi of the inferior element in the soul 
is the opposit of justic and is inharmoni and unnatur be to 
the soul what disea is to the bodi for in the soul a well a in the 
bodi good or bad action produc good or bad habit and virtu is the 
health and beauti and well be of the soul and vice is the disea 
and weak and deform of the soul 

again the old question return upon u is justic or injust the 
more profit the question ha becom ridicul for injust like 
mortal disea make life not worth have come up with me to the hill 
which overhang the citi and look down upon the singl form of virtu 
and the infinit form of vice among which are four special one 
characterist both of state and of individu and the state which 
correspond to the singl form of virtu is that which we have been 
describ wherein reason rule under one of two name monarchi and 
aristocraci thu there are five form in all both of state and of 
soul 

in attempt to prove that the soul ha three separ faculti plato 
take occa to discu what make differ of faculti and 
the criterion which he propo is differ in the work of the 
faculti the same faculti cannot produc contradictori effect but 
the path of earli reason is beset by thorni entangl and he 
will not proceed a step without first clear the ground thi lead 
him into a tiresom digress which is intend to explain the natur 
of contradict first the contradict must be at the same time and 
in the same relat secondli no extran word must be introduc 
into either of the term in which the contradictori proposit is 
express for exampl thirst is of drink not of warm drink he 
impli what he doe not say that if by the advic of reason or by 
the impul of anger a man is restrain from drink thi prof 
that thirst or desir under which thirst is includ is distinct 
from anger and reason but suppo that we allow the term thirst or 
desir to be modifi and say an angri thirst or a reveng 
desir then the two sphere of desir and anger overlap and becom 
confu thi case therefor ha to be exclud and still there 
remain an except to the rule in the use of the term good which is 
alway impli in the object of desir these are the discu of 
an age befor logic and ani one who is weari by them should rememb 
that they are necessari to the clear up of idea in the first 
develop of the human faculti 

the psycholog of plato extend no further than the divi of the soul 
into the ration irasc and concupisc element which a far 
a we know wa first made by him and ha been retain by aristotl 
and succeed ethic writer the chief difficulti in thi earli 
analysi of the mind is to defin exactli the place of the irasc 
faculti greek which may be variou describ under the term 
righteou indign spirit passion it is the foundat of courag 
which includ in plato moral courag the courag of endur pain and 
of surmount intellectu difficulti a well a of meet danger 
in war though irrat it inclin to side with the ration it 
cannot be arou by punish when justli inflict it sometim 
take the form of an enthusiasm which sustain a man in the perform 
of great action it is the lion heart with which the reason make 
a treati on the other hand it is neg rather than posit it 
is indign at wrong or falsehood but doe not like love in the 
symposium and phaedru aspir to the vision of truth or good it is the 
peremptori militari spirit which prevail in the govern of honour 
it differ from anger greek thi latter term have no accessori 
notion of righteou indign although aristotl ha retain the 
word yet we may observ that passion greek ha with him lost it 
affin to the ration and ha becom indistinguish from anger 
greek and to thi vernacular use plato himself in the law seem to 
revert though not alway by modern philosophi too a well a in our 
ordinari conver the word anger or passion are employ almost 
exclu in a bad sen there is no connot of a just or 
reason cau by which they are arou the feel of righteou 
indign is too partial and accid to admit of our regard 
it a a separ virtu or habit we are tempt also to doubt whether 
plato is right in suppo that an offend howev justli condemn 
could be expect to acknowledg the justic of hi sentenc thi is 
the spirit of a philosoph or martyr rather than of a crimin 

we may observ how nearli plato approach aristotl s famou thesi 
that good action produc good habit the word a healthi practic 
greek produc health so do just practic produc justic have 
a sound veri like the nicomachean ethic but we note also that an 
incid remark in plato ha becom a far reach principl in 
aristotl and an insepar part of a great ethic system 

there is a difficulti in understand what plato meant by the longer 
way he seem to intim some metaphi of the futur which will not 
be satisfi with argu from the principl of contradict in the 
sixth and seventh book compar sophist and parmenid he ha given 
u a sketch of such a metaphi but when glaucon ask for the final 
revel of the idea of good he is put off with the declar 
that he ha not yet studi the preliminari scienc how he would have 
fill up the sketch or argu about such question from a higher point 
of view we can onli conjectur perhap he hope to find some a priori 
method of develop the part out of the whole or he might have ask 
which of the idea contain the other idea and possibl have stumbl 
on the hegelian ident of the ego and the univ or he may 
have imagin that idea might be construct in some manner analog 
to the construct of figur and number in the mathemat scienc 
the most certain and necessari truth wa to plato the univ and to 
thi he wa alway seek to refer all knowledg or opinion just a in 
modern time we seek to rest them on the opposit pole of induct and 
experi the aspir of metaphysician have alway tend to 
pa beyond the limit of human thought and languag they seem to have 
reach a height at which they are move about in world unreal 
and their concept although profoundli affect their own mind 
becom invi or unintellig to other we are not therefor 
surpriz to find that plato himself ha nowher clearli explain hi 
doctrin of idea or that hi school in a later gener like hi 
contemporari glaucon and adeimantu were unabl to follow him in 
thi region of specul in the sophist where he is refut the 
sceptic which maintain either that there wa no such thing a 
predic or that all might be predic of all he arriv at the 
conclu that some idea combin with some but not all with all but 
he make onli one or two step forward on thi path he nowher attain 
to ani connect system of idea or even to a knowledg of the most 
elementari relat of the scienc to one anoth 

book v i wa go to enum the four form of vice or declin in 
state when polemarchu he wa sit a littl farther from me 
than adeimantu take him by the coat and lean toward him said 
someth in an underton of which i onli caught the word shall we 
let him off certainli not said adeimantu rai hi voic whom 
i said are you not go to let off you he said whi becau 
we think that you are not deal fairli with u in omit woman and

discour ye i said but the discour should be of a reason

the whole of life in such discu but pray without more ado tell 
u how thi commun is to be carri out and how the interv between

sever difficulti what is possibl is the first question what is

laughter but he who kill the truth is a murder then said 
glaucon laugh in case you should murder u we will acquit you

socrat proce the guardian of our state are to be watch dog a 
we have alreadi said now dog are not divid into he and she we do 
not take the masculin gender out to hunt and leav the femal at home 
to look after their puppi they have the same employ the onli 
differ between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other 
weaker but if woman are to have the same employ a men they must 
have the same educ they must be taught music and gymnast and 
the art of war i know that a great joke will be made of their ride 
on horseback and carri weapon the sight of the nake old wrinkl 
woman show their agil in the palaestra will certainli not be a 
vision of beauti and may be expect to becom a famou jest but we 
must not mind the wit there wa a time when they might have laugh at 
our present gymnast all is habit peopl have at last found out that 
the exposur is better than the conceal of the person and now they 
laugh no more evil onli should be the subject of ridicul 

the first question is whether woman are abl either wholli or partial 
to share in the employ of men and here we may be charg with 
inconsist in make the propo at all for we start origin 
with the divi of labour and the diver of employ wa base 
on the differ of natur but is there no differ between men 
and woman nay are they not wholli differ there wa the difficulti 
glaucon which made me unwil to speak of famili relat howev 
when a man is out of hi depth whether in a pool or in an ocean he can 
onli swim for hi life and we must tri to find a way of escap if we 
can 

the argument is that differ natur have differ u and the 
natur of men and woman are said to differ but thi is onli a verbal 
opposit we do not consid that the differ may be pure nomin 
and accid for exampl a bald man and a hairi man are oppo in a 
singl point of view but you cannot infer that becau a bald man is 
a cobbler a hairi man ought not to be a cobbler now whi is such an 
infer erron simpli becau the opposit between them is 
partial onli like the differ between a male physician and a femal 
physician not run through the whole natur like the differ 
between a physician and a carpent and if the differ of the sex 
is onli that the one beget and the other bear child thi doe not 
prove that they ought to have distinct educ admit that woman 
differ from men in capac do not men equal differ from one anoth 
ha not natur scatter all the qualiti which our citizen requir 
indiff up and down among the two sex and even in their 
peculiar pursuit are not woman often though in some case superior to 
men ridicul enough surpass by them woman are the same in kind 
a men and have the same aptitud or want of aptitud for medicin 
or gymnast or war but in a le degr one woman will be a good 
guardian anoth not and the good must be chosen to be the colleagu 
of our guardian if howev their natur are the same the infer 
is that their educ must also be the same there is no longer 
anyth unnatur or imposs in a woman learn music and 
gymnast and the educ which we give them will be the veri best 
far superior to that of cobbler and will train up the veri best woman 
and noth can be more advantag to the state than thi therefor 
let them strip cloth in their chastiti and share in the toil of war 
and in the defenc of their countri he who laugh at them is a fool for 
hi pain 

the first wave is past and the argument is compel to admit that men 
and woman have common duti and pursuit a second and greater wave is 
roll in commun of wife and child is thi either expedi 
or possibl the expedi i do not doubt i am not so sure of the 
possibl nay i think that a consid doubt will be entertain 
on both point i meant to have escap the troubl of prove the 
first but a you have detect the littl stratagem i must even submit 
onli allow me to feed my fanci like the solitari in hi walk with a 
dream of what might be and then i will return to the question of what 
can be 

in the first place our ruler will enforc the law and make new one 
where they are want and their alli or minist will obey you a 
legisl have alreadi select the men and now you shall select 
the woman after the select ha been made they will dwell in common 
hou and have their meal in common and will be brought togeth by 
a necess more certain than that of mathemat but they cannot be 
allow to live in licenti that is an unholi thing which 
the ruler are determin to prevent for the avoid of thi holi 
marriag festiv will be institut and their holi will be in 
proport to their use and here glaucon i should like to ask 
a i know that you are a breeder of bird and anim do you not take 
the greatest care in the mate certainli and there is no reason to 
suppo that le care is requir in the marriag of human be but 
then our ruler must be skil physician of the state for they will 
often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desir 
union between their subject the good must be pair with the good 
and the bad with the bad and the offspr of the one must be rear 
and of the other destroy in thi way the flock will be preserv in 
prime condit hymen festiv will be celebr at time fix 
with an eye to popul and the bride and bridegroom will meet at 
them and by an ingeni system of lot the ruler will contriv that 
the brave and the fair come togeth and that those of inferior breed 
are pair with inferior the latter will ascrib to chanc what is 
realli the invent of the ruler and when child are born the 
offspr of the brave and fair will be carri to an enclosur in a 
certain part of the citi and there attend by suitabl nur the 
rest will be hurri away to place unknown the mother will be brought 
to the fold and will suckl the child care howev must be taken 
that none of them recogni their own offspr and if necessari other 
nur may also be hire the troubl of watch and get up 
at night will be transfer to attend then the wife of our 
guardian will have a fine easi time when they are have child and 
quit right too i said that they should 

the parent ought to be in the prime of life which for a man may be 
reckon at thirti year from twenti five when he ha pa the 
point at which the speed of life is greatest to fifti five and at 
twenti year for a woman from twenti to forti ani one abov or below 
those age who partak in the hymen shall be guilti of impieti 
also everi one who form a marriag connexion at other time without the 
consent of the ruler thi latter regul appli to those who are 
within the specifi age after which they may rang at will provid 
they avoid the prohibit degr of parent and child or 
of brother and sister which last howev are not absolut 
prohibit if a dispen be procur but how shall we know the 
degr of affin when all thing are common the answer is that 
brother and sister are all such a are born seven or nine month after 
the espou and their parent those who are then espou and everi 
one will have mani child and everi child mani parent 

socrat proce i have now to prove that thi scheme is advantag 
and also consist with our entir politi the greatest good of a state 
is uniti the greatest evil discord and distract and there will be 
uniti where there are no privat pleasur or pain or interest where 
if one member suffer all the member suffer if one citizen is touch 
all are quickli sensit and the least hurt to the littl finger of 
the state run through the whole bodi and vibrat to the soul for the 
true state like an individu is injur a a whole when ani part is 
affect everi state ha subject and ruler who in a democraci are 
call ruler and in other state master but in our state they are 
call saviour and alli and the subject who in other state are 
term slave are by u term nurtur and paymast and those who 
are term comrad and colleagu in other place are by u call 
father and brother and wherea in other state member of the same 
govern regard one of their colleagu a a friend and anoth a an 
enemi in our state no man is a stranger to anoth for everi citizen 
is connect with everi other by tie of blood and these name and 
thi way of speak will have a correspond realiti brother father 
sister mother repeat from infanc in the ear of child will not 
be mere word then again the citizen will have all thing in common 
in have common properti they will have common pleasur and pain 

can there be strife and content among those who are of one mind or 
lawsuit about properti when men have noth but their bodi which 
they call their own or suit about violenc when everi one is bound 
to defend himself the permiss to strike when insult will be an 
antidot to the knife and will prevent disturb in the state but 
no younger man will strike an elder rever will prevent him from 
lay hand on hi kindr and he will fear that the rest of the 
famili may retali moreov our citizen will be rid of the 
lesser evil of life there will be no flatteri of the rich no sordid 
household care no borrow and not pay compar with the 
citizen of other state our will be olymp victor and crown 
with bless greater still they and their child have a better 
mainten dure life and after death an honour burial nor ha 
the happi of the individu been sacrif to the happi of the 
state our olymp victor ha not been turn into a cobbler but he 
ha a happi beyond that of ani cobbler at the same time if ani 
conceit youth begin to dream of appropri the state to himself 
he must be remind that half is better than the whole i should 
certainli advi him to stay where he is when he ha the promi of such 
a brave life 

but is such a commun possibl a among the anim so also among 
men and if possibl in what way possibl about war there is no 
difficulti the principl of commun is adapt to militari servic 
parent will take their child to look on at a battl just a 
potter boy are train to the busi by look on at the wheel 
and to the parent themselv a to other anim the sight of their 
young one will prove a great incent to braveri young warrior must 
learn but they must not run into danger although a certain degr of 
risk is worth incur when the benefit is great the young creatur 
should be place under the care of experienc veteran and they should 
have wing that is to say swift and tractabl steed on which they may 
fli away and escap one of the first thing to be done is to teach a 
youth to ride 

coward and desert shall be degrad to the class of husbandman 
gentleman who allow themselv to be taken prison may be present 
to the enemi but what shall be done to the hero first of all he shall 
be crown by all the youth in the armi secondli he shall receiv the 
right hand of fellowship and thirdli do you think that there is ani 
harm in hi be kiss we have alreadi determin that he shall have 
more wife than other in order that he may have a mani child 
a possibl and at a feast he shall have more to eat we have the 
author of homer for honour brave men with long chine which is 
an appropri compliment becau meat is a veri strengthen thing 
fill the bowl then and give the best seat and meat to the brave may 
they do them good and he who dy in battl will be at onc declar to 
be of the golden race and will a we believ becom one of hesiod s 
guardian angel he shall be worship after death in the manner 
prescrib by the oracl and not onli he but all other benefactor 
of the state who die in ani other way shall be admit to the same 
honour 

the next question is how shall we treat our enemi shall hellen be 
enslav no for there is too great a risk of the whole race pa 
under the yoke of the barbarian or shall the dead be despoil 
certainli not for that sort of thing is an excu for skulk and ha 
been the ruin of mani an armi there is mean and feminin malic in 
make an enemi of the dead bodi when the soul which wa the owner ha 
fled like a dog who cannot reach hi assail and quarrel with 
the stone which are thrown at him instead again the arm of hellen 
should not be offer up in the templ of the god they are a 
pollut for they are taken from brother and on similar ground 
there should be a limit to the devast of hellen territori the 
hou should not be burnt nor more than the annual produc carri 
off for war is of two kind civil and foreign the first of which is 
properli term discord and onli the second war and war between 
hellen is in realiti civil war a quarrel in a famili which is ever 
to be regard a unpatriot and unnatur and ought to be prosecut 
with a view to reconcili in a true phil hellen spirit a of 
those who would chasten but not utterli enslav the war is not against 
a whole nation who are a friendli multitud of men woman and child 
but onli against a few guilti person when they are punish peac will 
be restor that is the way in which hellen should war against one 
anoth and against barbarian a they war against one anoth now 

but my dear socrat you are forget the main question is such a 
state possibl i grant all and more than you say about the bless 
of be one famili father brother mother daughter go out 
to war togeth but i want to ascertain the possibl of thi ideal 
state you are too unmerci the first wave and the second wave i 
have hardli escap and now you will certainli drown me with the third 
when you see the tower crest of the wave i expect you to take piti 
not a whit 

well then we were led to form our ideal politi in the search after 
justic and the just man answer to the just state is thi ideal at 
all the wor for be impract would the pictur of a perfectli 
beauti man be ani the wor becau no such man ever live can ani 
realiti come up to the idea natur will not allow word to be fulli 
realiz but if i am to tri and realiz the ideal of the state in a 
measur i think that an approach may be made to the perfect of which 
i dream by one or two i do not say slight but possibl chang in the 
present constitut of state i would reduc them to a singl one the 
great wave a i call it until then king are philosoph or 
philosoph are king citi will never cea from ill no nor the 
human race nor will our ideal politi ever come into be i know that 
thi is a hard say which few will be abl to receiv socrat 
all the world will take off hi coat and rush upon you with stick and 
stone and therefor i would advi you to prepar an answer you got 
me into the scrape i said and i wa right he repli howev i 
will stand by you a a sort of do noth well mean alli have 
the help of such a champion i will do my best to maintain my posit 
and first i must explain of whom i speak and what sort of natur these 
are who are to be philosoph and ruler a you are a man of pleasur 
you will not have forgotten how indiscrimin lover are in their 
attach they love all and turn blemish into beauti the 
snub nose youth is said to have a win grace the beak of anoth 
ha a royal look the featureless are faultless the dark are manli the 
fair angel the sickli have a new term of endear invent expressli 
for them which is honey pale lover of wine and lover of ambit 
also desir the object of their affect in everi form now here come 
the point the philosoph too is a lover of knowledg in everi form 
he ha an insati curio but will curio make a philosoph 
are the lover of sight and sound who let out their ear to everi 
choru at the dionysiac festiv to be call philosoph they 
are not true philosoph but onli an imit then how are we to 
describ the true 

you would acknowledg the exist of abstract idea such a justic 
beauti good evil which are sever one yet in their variou 
combin appear to be mani those who recogn these realiti are 
philosoph wherea the other class hear sound and see colour 
and understand their use in the art but cannot attain to the true or 
wake vision of absolut justic or beauti or truth they have not the 
light of knowledg but of opinion and what they see is a dream onli 
perhap he of whom we say the last will be angri with u can we pacifi 
him without reveal the disord of hi mind suppo we say that 
if he ha knowledg we rejoic to hear it but knowledg must be of 
someth which is a ignor is of someth which is not and there 
is a third thing which both is and is not and is matter of opinion 
onli opinion and knowledg then have distinct object must also 
be distinct faculti and by faculti i mean power unseen and 
distinguish onli by the differ in their object a opinion 
and knowledg differ sinc the one is liabl to err but the other 
is uner and is the mightiest of all our faculti if be is 
the object of knowledg and not be of ignor and these are the 
extrem opinion must lie between them and may be call darker than 
the one and brighter than the other thi intermedi or cont 
matter is and is not at the same time and partak both of exist 
and of non exist now i would ask my good friend who deni 
abstract beauti and justic and affirm a mani beauti and a 
mani just whether everyth he see is not in some point of view 
differ the beauti ugli the piou impiou the just unjust is 
not the doubl also the half and are not heavi and light rel term 
which pa into one anoth everyth is and is not a in the old 
riddl a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a 
bird with a stone and not a stone the mind cannot be fix on either 
altern and these ambigu intermedi er half light 
object which have a disorderli movement in the region between be 
and not be are the proper matter of opinion a the immut 
object are the proper matter of knowledg and he who grovel in the 
world of sen and ha onli thi uncertain percept of thing is not 
a philosoph but a lover of opinion onli 

the fifth book is the new begin of the republ in which the 
commun of properti and of famili are first maintain and the 
transit is made to the kingdom of philosoph for both of these 
plato after hi manner ha been prepar in some chanc word of book 
iv which fall unperceiv on the reader s mind a they are suppo 
at first to have fallen on the ear of glaucon and adeimantu the 
paradox a morgenstern term them of thi book of the republ 
will be reserv for anoth place a few remark on the style and some 
explan of difficulti may be briefli ad 

first there is the imag of the wave which serf for a sort of 
scheme or plan of the book the first wave the second wave the third 
and greatest wave come roll in and we hear the roar of them all 
that can be said of the extravag of plato s propo is anticip 
by himself noth is more admir than the hesit with which he 
propo the solemn text until king are philosoph etc or the 
reaction from the sublim to the ridicul when glaucon describ the 
manner in which the new truth will be receiv by mankind 

some defect and difficulti may be note in the execut of the 
communist plan noth is told u of the applic of commun 
to the lower class nor is the tabl of prohibit degr capabl of 
be made out it is quit possibl that a child born at one hymen 
festiv may marri one of it own brother or sister or even one of 
it parent at anoth plato is afraid of incestu union but at 
the same time he doe not wish to bring befor u the fact that the citi 
would be divid into famili of those born seven and nine month after 
each hymen festiv if it were worth while to argu seriou about 
such fanci we might remark that while all the old affin are 
abolish the newli prohibit affin rest not on ani natur or 
ration principl but onli upon the accid of child have been 
born in the same month and year nor doe he explain how the lot could 
be so manipul by the legislatur a to bring togeth the fairest 
and best the singular express which is employ to describ the age 
of five and twenti may perhap be taken from some poet 

in the delin of the philosoph the illustr of the natur 
of philosophi deriv from love are more suit to the apprehen 
of glaucon the athenian man of pleasur than to modern tast or 
feel they are partli faceti but also contain a germ of truth 
that scienc is a whole remain a true principl of induct a well 
a of metaphi philosophi and the love of univ knowledg is 
still the characterist of the philosoph in modern a well a in 
ancient time 

at the end of the fifth book plato introduc the figment of cont 
matter which ha exerci so great an influenc both on the ethic and 
theolog of the modern world and which occur here for the first time 
in the histori of philosophi he did not remark that the degr of 
knowledg in the subject have noth correspond to them in the 
object with him a word must answer to an idea and he could not 
conceiv of an opinion which wa an opinion about noth the influenc 
of analog led him to invent parallel and conjug and to overlook 
fact to u some of hi difficulti are puzzl onli from their 
simplic we do not perceiv that the answer to them is tumbl out 
at our foot to the mind of earli thinker the concept of not be 
wa dark and mysteri they did not see that thi terribl apparit 
which threaten destruct to all knowledg wa onli a logic 
determin the common term under which through the accid use 
of languag two entir differ idea were includ wa anoth 
sourc of confu thu through the ambigu of greek plato 
attempt to introduc order into the first chao of human thought 
seem to have confu percept and opinion and to have fail to 
distinguish the cont from the rel in the theaetetu the 
first of these difficulti begin to clear up in the sophist the 
second and for thi a well a for other reason both these dialogu 
are probabl to be regard a later than the republ 

book vi have determin that the mani have no knowledg of true 
be and have no clear pattern in their mind of justic beauti 
truth and that philosoph have such pattern we have now to ask 
whether they or the mani shall be ruler in our state but who can doubt 
that philosoph should be chosen if they have the other qualiti 
which are requir in a ruler for they are lover of the knowledg of 
the etern and of all truth they are hater of falsehood their meaner 
desir are absorb in the interest of knowledg they are spectat 
of all time and all exist and in the magnif of their 
contempl the life of man is a noth to them nor is death 
fear also they are of a social graciou disposit equal free 
from coward and arrog they learn and rememb easili they have 
harmoni well regul mind truth flow to them sweetli by natur 
can the god of jealousi himself find ani fault with such an assemblag 
of good qualiti 

here adeimantu interpo no man can answer you socrat but everi 
man feel that thi is owe to hi own defici in argument he is 
driven from one posit to anoth until he ha noth more to say 
just a an unskil player at draught is reduc to hi last move by 
a more skill oppon and yet all the time he may be right he may 
know in thi veri instanc that those who make philosophi the busi 
of their life gener turn out rogu if they are bad men and fool 
if they are good what do you say i should say that he is quit right 
then how is such an admiss reconcil with the doctrin that 
philosoph should be king 

i shall answer you in a parabl which will also let you see how poor a 
hand i am at the invent of allegori the relat of good men to 
their govern is so peculiar that in order to defend them i must 
take an illustr from the world of fiction conceiv the captain 
of a ship taller by a head and shoulder than ani of the crew yet a 
littl deaf a littl blind and rather ignor of the seaman s art 
the sailor want to steer although they know noth of the art and 
they have a theori that it cannot be learn if the helm is refu 
them they drug the captain s posset bind him hand and foot and take 
poss of the ship he who join in the mutini is term a good 
pilot and what not they have no concept that the true pilot must 
observ the wind and the star and must be their master whether 
they like it or not such an one would be call by them fool prater 
star gazer thi is my parabl which i will beg you to interpret for 
me to those gentleman who ask whi the philosoph ha such an evil name 
and to explain to them that not he but those who will not use him are 
to blame for hi useless the philosoph should not beg of mankind 
to be put in author over them the wise man should not seek the rich 
a the proverb bid but everi man whether rich or poor must knock at 
the door of the physician when he ha need of him now the pilot is 
the philosoph he whom in the parabl they call star gazer and the 
mutin sailor are the mob of politician by whom he is render 
useless not that these are the worst enemi of philosophi who is far 
more dishonour by her own profess son when they are corrupt by 
the world need i recal the origin imag of the philosoph did we 
not say of him just now that he love truth and hate falsehood and 
that he could not rest in the multipl of phenomenon but wa led by 
a sympathi in hi own natur to the contempl of the absolut all 
the virtu a well a truth who is the leader of them took up their 
abod in hi soul but a you were observ if we turn asid to view 
the realiti we see that the person who were thu describ with the 
except of a small and useless class are utter rogu 

the point which ha to be consid is the origin of thi corrupt 
in natur everi one will admit that the philosoph in our descript 
of him is a rare be but what numberless cau tend to destroy 
these rare be there is no good thing which may not be a cau of 
evil health wealth strength rank and the virtu themselv 
when place under unfavour circumst for a in the anim or 
veget world the strongest seed most need the accompani of good 
air and soil so the best of human charact turn out the worst when 
they fall upon an unsuit soil wherea weak natur hardli ever 
do ani consid good or harm they are not the stuff out of which 
either great crimin or great hero are made the philosoph follow 
the same analog he is either the best or the worst of all men some 
person say that the sophist are the corrupt of youth but is not 
public opinion the real sophist who is everywh present in those veri 
person in the assembl in the court in the camp in the applau 
and hiss of the theatr re echo by the surround hill will not 
a young man s heart leap amid these discord sound and will ani 
educ save him from be carri away by the torrent nor is thi 
all for if he will not yield to opinion there follow the gentl 
compul of exil or death what principl of rival sophist or 
anybodi el can overcom in such an unequ contest charact there 
may be more than human who are except god may save a man but not 
hi own strength further i would have you consid that the hirel 
sophist onli give back to the world their own opinion he is the 
keeper of the monster who know how to flatter or anger him and 
observ the mean of hi inarticul grunt good is what plea 
him evil what he dislik truth and beauti are determin onli by 
the tast of the brute such is the sophist s wisdom and such is the 
condit of those who make public opinion the test of truth whether in 
art or in moral the cur is laid upon them of be and do what 
it approv and when they attempt first principl the failur is 
ludicr think of all thi and ask yourself whether the world is more 
like to be a believ in the uniti of the idea or in the multipl 
of phenomenon and the world if not a believ in the idea cannot be a 
philosoph and must therefor be a persecutor of philosoph there 
is anoth evil the world doe not like to lose the gift natur and 
so they flatter the young alcibiad into a magnif opinion of hi 
own capac the tall proper youth begin to expand and is dream 
of kingdom and empir if at thi instant a friend whisper to 
him now the god lighten thee thou art a great fool and must be 
educ do you think that he will listen or suppo a better sort of 
man who is attract toward philosophi will they not make herculean 
effort to spoil and corrupt him are we not right in say that the 
love of knowledg no le than rich may divert him men of thi 
class critia often becom politician they are the author of 
great mischief in state and sometim also of great good and thu 
philosophi is desert by her natur protector and other enter in 
and dishonour her vulgar littl mind see the land open and rush from 
the prison of the art into her templ a clever mechan have a 
soul coar a hi bodi think that he will gain cast by becom her 
suitor for philosophi even in her fallen estat ha a digniti of her 
own and he like a bald littl blacksmith s apprent a he is have 
made some money and got out of duranc wash and dress himself a a 
bridegroom and marri hi master s daughter what will be the issu of 
such marriag will they not be vile and bastard devoid of truth 
and natur they will small then is the remnant of genuin 
philosoph there may be a few who are citizen of small state in 
which polit are not worth think of or who have been detain by 
theag bridl of ill health for my own case of the oracular sign is 
almost uniqu and too rare to be worth mention and these few when 
they have tast the pleasur of philosophi and have taken a look at 
that den of thief and place of wild beast which is human life 
will stand asid from the storm under the shelter of a wall and tri to 
preserv their own innoc and to depart in peac a great work too 
will have been accomplish by them great ye but not the greatest 
for man is a social be and can onli attain hi highest develop 
in the societi which is best suit to him 

enough then of the cau whi philosophi ha such an evil name 
anoth question is which of exist state is suit to her not one 
of them at present she is like some exot seed which degen in 
a strang soil onli in her proper state will she be shown to be of 
heavenli growth and is her proper state our or some other our in 
all point but one which wa left undetermin you may rememb our 
say that some live mind or wit of the legisl wa need in 
state but we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulti 
and now the question recur and ha not grown easier how may 
philosophi be safe studi let u bring her into the light of day 
and make an end of the inquiri 

in the first place i say boldli that noth can be wor than the 
present mode of studi person usual pick up a littl philosophi in 
earli youth and in the interv of busi but they never master the 
real difficulti which is dialect later perhap they occas 
go to a lectur on philosophi year advanc and the sun of philosophi 
unlik that of heracleitu set never to rise again thi order of 
educ should be rever it should begin with gymnast in youth 
and a the man strengthen he should increa the gymnast of 
hi soul then when activ life is over let him final return to 
philosophi you are in earnest socrat but the world will be equal 
earnest in withstand you no more than thrasymachu do not make a 
quarrel between thrasymachu and me who were never enemi and are 
now good friend enough and i shall do my best to convinc him and 
all mankind of the truth of my word or at ani rate to prepar for 
the futur when in anoth life we may again take part in similar 
discu that will be a long time henc not long in comparison 
with etern the mani will probabl remain incredul for they 
have never seen the natur uniti of idea but onli artifici 
juxtaposit not free and gener thought but trick of 
controversi and quip of law a perfect man rule in a perfect state 
even a singl one they have not known and we foresaw that there wa no 
chanc of perfect either in state or individu until a necess 
wa laid upon philosoph not the rogu but those whom we call 
the useless class of hold offic or until the son of king were 
inspir with a true love of philosophi whether in the infin of 
past time there ha been or is in some distant land or ever will be 
hereaft an ideal such a we have describ we stoutli maintain 
that there ha been is and will be such a state whenev the muse of 
philosophi rule will you say that the world is of anoth mind o my 
friend do not revil the world they will soon chang their opinion 
if they are gentli entreat and are taught the true natur of the 
philosoph who can hate a man who love him or be jealou of one who 
ha no jealousi consid again that the mani hate not the true but 
the fal philosoph the pretend who forc their way in without 
invit and are alway speak of person and not of principl 
which is unlik the spirit of philosophi for the true philosoph 
despi earthli strife hi eye is fix on the etern order in 
accord with which he mould himself into the divin imag and not 
himself onli but other men and is the creator of the virtu privat 
a well a public when mankind see that the happi of state is onli 
to be found in that imag will they be angri with u for attempt 
to delin it certainli not but what will be the process of 
delin the artist will do noth until he ha made a tabula 
rasa on thi he will inscrib the constitut of a state glanc 
often at the divin truth of natur and from that deriv the godlik 
among men mingl the two element rub out and paint in 
until there is a perfect harmoni or fusion of the divin and human but 
perhap the world will doubt the exist of such an artist what will 
they doubt that the philosoph is a lover of truth have a natur 
akin to the best and if they admit thi will they still quarrel with 
u for make philosoph our king they will be le dispo to 
quarrel let u assum then that they are pacifi still a person may 
hesit about the probabl of the son of a king be a philosoph 
and we do not deni that they are veri liabl to be corrupt but yet 
sure in the cour of age there might be one except and one 
is enough if one son of a king were a philosoph and had obedi 
citizen he might bring the ideal politi into be henc we conclud 
that our law are not onli the best but that they are also possibl 
though not free from difficulti 

i gain noth by evad the troublesom question which aro 
concern woman and child i will be wiser now and acknowledg 
that we must go to the bottom of anoth question what is to be the 
educ of our guardian it wa agr that they were to be lover of 
their countri and were to be test in the refin s fire of pleasur 
and pain and those who came forth pure and remain fix in their 
principl were to have honour and reward in life and after death 
but at thi point the argument put on her veil and turn into anoth 
path i hesit to make the assert which i now hazard that our 
guardian must be philosoph you rememb all the contradictori 
element which met in the philosoph how difficult to find them all 
in a singl person intellig and spirit are not often combin with 
steadi the stolid fearless natur is aver to intellectu toil 
and yet these opposit element are all necessari and therefor a 
we were say befor the aspir must be test in pleasur and 
danger and also a we must now further add in the highest branch 
of knowledg you will rememb that when we spoke of the virtu 
mention wa made of a longer road which you were satisfi to leav 
unexplor enough seem to have been said enough my friend but 
what is enough while anyth remain want of all men the guardian 
must not faint in the search after truth he must be prepar to take 
the longer road or he will never reach that higher region which is 
abov the four virtu and of the virtu too he must not onli get an 
outlin but a clear and distinct vision strang that we should be so 
preci about trifl so careless about the highest truth and what 
are the highest you to pretend unconsci when you have so often 
heard me speak of the idea of good about which we know so littl and 
without which though a man gain the world he ha no profit of it some 
peopl imagin that the good is wisdom but thi involv a circl the 
good they say is wisdom wisdom ha to do with the good accord to 
other the good is pleasur but then come the absurd that good is 
bad for there are bad pleasur a well a good again the good must 
have realiti a man may desir the appear of virtu but he will not 
desir the appear of good ought our guardian then to be ignor 
of thi suprem principl of which everi man ha a presenti and 
without which no man ha ani real knowledg of anyth but socrat 
what is thi suprem principl knowledg or pleasur or what you may 
think me troublesom but i say that you have no busi to be alway 
repeat the doctrin of other instead of give u your own can 
i say what i do not know you may offer an opinion and will the 
blind and crook of opinion content you when you might have 
the light and certainti of scienc i will onli ask you to give such 
an explan of the good a you have given alreadi of temper and 
justic i wish that i could but in my present mood i cannot reach to 
the height of the knowledg of the good to the parent or princip i 
cannot introduc you but to the child begotten in hi imag which 
i may compar with the interest on the princip i will audit the 
account and do not let me give you a fal statement of the debt 
you rememb our old distinct of the mani beauti and the one 
beauti the particular and the univ the object of sight and 
the object of thought did you ever consid that the object of sight 
impli a faculti of sight which is the most complex and costli of our 
sen requir not onli object of sen but also a medium which is 
light without which the sight will not distinguish between colour and 
all will be a blank for light is the nobl bond between the perceiv 
faculti and the thing perceiv and the god who give u light is the 
sun who is the eye of the day but is not to be confound with the eye 
of man thi eye of the day or sun is what i call the child of the good 
stand in the same relat to the visibl world a the good to the 
intellectu when the sun shine the eye see and in the intellectu 
world where truth is there is sight and light now that which is the 
sun of intellig natur is the idea of good the cau of knowledg 
and truth yet other and fairer than they are and stand in the 
same relat to them in which the sun stand to light o inconceiv 
height of beauti which is abov knowledg and abov truth you cannot 
sure mean pleasur he said peac i repli and thi idea of 
good like the sun is also the cau of growth and the author not of 
knowledg onli but of be yet greater far than either in digniti 
and power that is a reach of thought more than human but pray go 
on with the imag for i suspect that there is more behind there is 
i said and bear in mind our two sun or principl imagin further 
their correspond world one of the visibl the other of the 
intellig you may assist your fanci by figur the distinct 
under the imag of a line divid into two unequ part and may again 
subdivid each part into two lesser segment repr of the 
stage of knowledg in either sphere the lower portion of the lower or 
visibl sphere will consist of shadow and reflect and it upper 
and smaller portion will contain real object in the world of natur 
or of art the sphere of the intellig will also have two 
divi one of mathemat in which there is no ascent but all is 
descent no inquir into premi but onli draw of infer 
in thi divi the mind work with figur and number the imag of 
which are taken not from the shadow but from the object although 
the truth of them is seen onli with the mind s eye and they are use a 
hypothesi without be anali wherea in the other divi reason 
u the hypothesi a stage or step in the ascent to the idea of 
good to which she fasten them and then again descend walk firmli 
in the region of idea and of idea onli in her ascent a well a 
descent and final rest in them i partli understand he repli 
you mean that the idea of scienc are superior to the hypothet 
metaphor concept of geometri and the other art or scienc 
whichev is to be the name of them and the latter concept you 
refu to make subject of pure intellect becau they have no first 
principl although when rest on a first principl they pa into 
the higher sphere you understand me veri well i said and now to 
those four divi of knowledg you may assign four correspond 
faculti pure intellig to the highest sphere activ intellig 
to the second to the third faith to the fourth the percept of 
shadow and the clear of the sever faculti will be in the same 
ratio a the truth of the object to which they are relat 

like socrat we may recapitul the virtu of the philosoph 
in languag which seem to reach beyond the horizon of that age 
and countri he is describ a the spectat of all time and all 
exist he ha the noblest gift of natur and make the highest 
use of them all hi desir are absorb in the love of wisdom which 
is the love of truth none of the grace of a beauti soul are want 
in him neither can he fear death or think much of human life the 
ideal of modern time hardli retain the simplic of the antiqu 
there is not the same origin either in truth or error which 
charact the greek the philosoph is no longer live in the 
unseen nor is he sent by an oracl to convinc mankind of ignor 
nor doe he regard knowledg a a system of idea lead upward by 
regular stage to the idea of good the eager of the pursuit ha 
abat there is more divi of labour and le of comprehen 
reflect upon natur and human life a a whole more of exact 
observ and le of anticip and inspir still in the 
alter condit of knowledg the parallel is not wholli lost and 
there may be a use in translat the concept of plato into the 
languag of our own age the philosoph in modern time is one who 
fix hi mind on the law of natur in their sequenc and connexion 
not on fragment or pictur of natur on histori not on controversi 
on the truth which are acknowledg by the few not on the opinion 
of the mani he is awar of the import of classifi accord to 
natur and will tri to separ the limb of scienc without break 
them phaedr there is no part of truth whether great or small 
which he will dishonour and in the least thing he will discern the 
greatest parmen like the ancient philosoph he see the world 
pervad by analog but he can also tell whi in some case a singl 
instanc is suffici for an induct mill s logic while in 
other case a thousand exampl would prove noth he inquir into 
a portion of knowledg onli becau the whole ha grown too vast to be 
embrac by a singl mind or life he ha a clearer concept of the 
divi of scienc and of their relat to the mind of man than wa 
possibl to the ancient like plato he ha a vision of the uniti of 
knowledg not a the begin of philosophi to be attain by a studi 
of elementari mathemat but a the far off result of the work 
of mani mind in mani age he is awar that mathemat studi are 
preliminari to almost everi other at the same time he will not reduc 
all varieti of knowledg to the type of mathemat he too must have 
a nobil of charact without which geniu lose the better half 
of great regard the world a a point in immen and each 
individu a a link in a never end chain of exist he will not 
think much of hi own life or be greatli afraid of death 

adeimantu object first of all to the form of the socrat reason 
thu show that plato is awar of the imperfect of hi own method 
he bring the accu against himself which might be brought against 
him by a modern logician that he extract the answer becau he know 
how to put the question in a long argument word are apt to chang 
their mean slightli or premi may be assum or conclu 
infer with rather too much certainti or univ the variat 
at each step may be unobserv and yet at last the diverg becom 
consid henc the failur of attempt to appli arithmet or 
algebra formula to logic the imperfect or rather the higher 
and more elast natur of languag doe not allow word to have the 
preci of number or of symbol and thi qualiti in languag impair 
the forc of an argument which ha mani step 

the object though fairli met by socrat in thi particular 
instanc may be regard a impli a reflect upon the socrat 
mode of reason and here a elsewh plato seem to intim that 
the time had come when the neg and interrog method of socrat 
must be supers by a posit and construct one of which exampl 
are given in some of the later dialogu adeimantu further argu 
that the ideal is wholli at varianc with fact for experi prof 
philosoph to be either useless or rogu contrari to all expect 
socrat ha no hesit in admit the truth of thi and explain 
the anomali in an allegori first characterist depreci hi 
own invent power in thi allegori the peopl are distinguish from 
the profess politician and a elsewh are spoken of in a tone 
of piti rather than of censur under the imag of the nobl captain who 
is not veri quick in hi percept 

the useless of philosoph is explain by the circumst that 
mankind will not use them the world in all age ha been divid 
between contempt and fear of those who employ the power of idea and 
know no other weapon concern the fal philosoph socrat argu 
that the best is most liabl to corrupt and that the finer natur is 
more like to suffer from alien condit we too observ that there 
are some kind of excel which spring from a peculiar delicaci 
of constitut a is evid true of the poetic and imagin 
tempera which often seem to depend on impress and henc can 
onli breath or live in a certain atmosph the man of geniu 
ha greater pain and greater pleasur greater power and greater 
weak and often a greater play of charact than is to be found in 
ordinari men he can assum the disgui of virtu or disinterest 
without have them or veil person enmiti in the languag of 
patriot and philosophi he can say the word which all men are 
think he ha an insight which is terribl into the folli and 
weak of hi fellow men an alcibiad a mirabeau or a napoleon 
the first are born either to be the author of great evil in state 
or of great good when they are drawn in that direct 

yet the thesi corruptio optimi pessima cannot be maintain 
gener or without regard to the kind of excel which is 
corrupt the alien condit which are corrupt to one natur may 
be the element of cultur to anoth in gener a man can onli receiv 
hi highest develop in a congeni state or famili among friend 
or fellow worker but also he may sometim be stir by adver 
circumst to such a degr that he rise up against them and reform 
them and while weaker or coarser charact will extract good out of 
evil say in a corrupt state of the church or of societi and live on 
happili allow the evil to remain the finer or stronger natur may 
be crush or spoil by surround influenc may becom misanthrop 
and philanthrop by turn or in a few instanc like the founder 
of the monast order or the reform owe to some peculiar in 
themselv or in their age may break away entir from the world and 
from the church sometim into great good sometim into great evil 
sometim into both and the same hold in the lesser sphere of a 
convent a school a famili 

plato would have u consid how easili the best natur are overpow 
by public opinion and what effort the rest of mankind will make to 
get poss of them the world the church their own profess ani 
polit or parti organ are alway carri them off their leg 
and teach them to appli high and holi name to their own prejud 
and interest the monster corpor to which they belong judg 
right and truth to be the pleasur of the commun the individu 
becom one with hi order or if he resist the world is too much for 
him and will sooner or later be reveng on him thi is perhap a 
one side but not wholli untru pictur of the maxim and practic of 
mankind when they sit down togeth at an assembl either in ancient 
or modern time 

when the higher natur are corrupt by polit the lower take 
poss of the vacant place of philosophi thi is describ in one 
of those continu imag in which the argument to use a platon 
express veil herself and which is drop and reappear at 
interv the question is ask whi are the citizen of state so 
hostil to philosophi the answer is that they do not know her and yet 
there is also a better mind of the mani they would believ if they were 
taught but hitherto they have onli known a convent imit of 
philosophi word without thought system which have no life in them 
a divin person utter the word of beauti and freedom the friend 
of man hold communion with the etern and seek to frame the 
state in that imag they have never known the same doubl feel 
respect the mass of mankind ha alway exist among men the first 
thought is that the peopl are the enemi of truth and right the 
second that thi onli ari out of an accid error and confu 
and that they do not realli hate those who love them if they could be 
educ to know them 

in the latter part of the sixth book three question have to be 
consid 1st the natur of the longer and more circuit way which 
is contrast with the shorter and more imperfect method of book iv 
2nd the heavenli pattern or idea of the state 3rd the relat of the 
divi of knowledg to one anoth and to the correspond faculti 
of the soul 

1 of the higher method of knowledg in plato we have onli a glimp 
neither here nor in the phaedru or symposium nor yet in the philebu 
or sophist doe he give ani clear explan of hi mean he would 
probabl have describ hi method a proceed by regular step to a 
system of univ knowledg which infer the part from the whole 
rather than the whole from the part thi ideal logic is not practi 
by him in the search after justic or in the analysi of the part of 
the soul there like aristotl in the nicomachean ethic he argu 
from experi and the common use of languag but at the end of the 
sixth book he conceiv anoth and more perfect method in which 
all idea are onli step or grade or moment of thought form a 
connect whole which is self support and in which consist is 
the test of truth he doe not explain to u in detail the natur of the 
process like mani other thinker both in ancient and modern time 
hi mind seem to be fill with a vacant form which he is unabl to 
realiz he suppo the scienc to have a natur order and connexion 
in an age when they can hardli be said to exist he is hasten on to 
the end of the intellectu world without even make a begin of 
them 

in modern time we hardli need to be remind that the process of 
acquir knowledg is here confu with the contempl of absolut 
knowledg in all scienc a priori and a posteriori truth mingl in 
variou proport the a priori part is that which is deriv from the 
most univ experi of men or is univ accept by 
them the a posteriori is that which grow up around the more 
gener principl and becom impercept one with them but plato 
erron imago that the synthesi is separ from the analysi 
and that the method of scienc can anticip scienc in entertain 
such a vision of a priori knowledg he is suffici justifi or at 
least hi mean may be suffici explain by the similar attempt 
of descart kant hegel and even of bacon himself in modern 
philosophi anticip or divin or prophet glimp of 
truth whether concern man or natur seem to stand in the same 
relat to ancient philosophi which hypothesi bear to modern induct 
scienc these guess at truth were not made at random they aro 
from a superfici impress of uniform and first principl 
in natur which the geniu of the greek contempl the expan of 
heaven and earth seem to recogn in the distanc nor can we deni 
that in ancient time knowledg must have stood still and the human 
mind been depriv of the veri instrument of thought if philosophi had 
been strictli confin to the result of experi 

2 plato suppo that when the tablet ha been made blank the artist 
will fill in the lineament of the ideal state is thi a pattern laid 
up in heaven or mere vacanc on which he is suppo to gaze with 
wonder eye the answer is that such ideal are frame partli by the 
omiss of particular partli by imagin perfect the form which 
experi suppli phaedo plato repr these ideal in a 
figur a belong to anoth world and in modern time the idea will 
sometim seem to prece at other time to co oper with the hand 
of the artist a in scienc so also in creativ art there is a 
synthet a well a an analyt method one man will have the whole 
in hi mind befor he begin to anoth the process of mind and hand 
will be simultan 

3 there is no difficulti in see that plato s divi of knowledg 
are base first on the fundament antithesi of sensibl and 
intellectu which pervad the whole pre socrat philosophi in which 
is impli also the opposit of the perman and transient of the 
univ and particular but the age of philosophi in which he live 
seem to requir a further distinct number and figur were 
begin to separ from idea the world could no longer regard 
justic a a cube and wa learn to see though imperfectli that 
the abstract of sen were distinct from the abstract of mind 
between the eleat be or essenc and the shadow of phenomenon the 
pythagorean principl of number found a place and wa a aristotl 
remark a conduct medium from one to the other henc plato is led 
to introduc a third term which had not hitherto enter into the scheme 
of hi philosophi he had observ the use of mathemat in educ 
they were the best prepar for higher studi the subject 
relat between them further suggest an object one although 
the passag from one to the other is realli imaginari metaph for 
metaphi and moral philosophi ha no connexion with mathemat 
number and figur are the abstract of time and space not the 
express of pure intellectu concept when divest of 
metaphor a straight line or a squar ha no more to do with right and 
justic than a crook line with vice the figur associ wa 
mistaken for a real one and thu the three latter divi of the 
platon proport were construct 

there is more difficulti in comprehend how he arriv at the 
first term of the seri which is nowher el mention and ha no 
refer to ani other part of hi system nor ind doe the relat 
of shadow to object correspond to the relat of number to idea 
probabl plato ha been led by the love of analog timaeu to make 
four term instead of three although the object perceiv in both 
divi of the lower sphere are equal object of sen he is also 
prepar the way a hi manner is for the shadow of imag at the 
begin of the seventh book and the imit of an imit in the 
tenth the line may be regard a reach from uniti to infin and 
is divid into two unequ part and subdivid into two more 
each lower sphere is the multipl of the prece of the four 
faculti faith in the lower divi ha an intermedi posit cp 
for the use of the word faith or belief greek timaeu contrast 
equal with the vagu of the percept of shadow greek and the 
higher certainti of understand greek and reason greek 

the differ between understand and mind or reason greek is 
analog to the differ between acquir knowledg in the part 
and the contempl of the whole true knowledg is a whole and is 
at rest consist and univ are the test of truth to thi 
self evidenc knowledg of the whole the faculti of mind is suppo 
to correspond but there is a knowledg of the understand which 
is incomplet and in motion alway becau unabl to rest in 
the subordin idea those idea are call both imag and 
hypothesi imag becau they are cloth in sen hypothesi becau 
they are assumpt onli until they are brought into connexion with 
the idea of good 

the gener mean of the passag nobl then is the bond which 
link togeth sight and of thi kind i spoke a the intellig 
so far a the thought contain in it admit of be translat 
into the term of modern philosophi may be describ or explain a 
follow there is a truth one and self exist to which by the help 
of a ladder let down from abov the human intellig may ascend thi 
uniti is like the sun in the heaven the light by which all thing are 
seen the be by which they are creat and sustain it is the 
idea of good and the step of the ladder lead up to thi highest or 
univ exist are the mathemat scienc which also contain 
in themselv an element of the univ these too we see in a new 
manner when we connect them with the idea of good they then cea to 
be hypothesi or pictur and becom essenti part of a higher truth 
which is at onc their first principl and their final cau 

we cannot give ani more preci mean to thi remark passag but 
we may trace in it sever rudiment or vestig of thought which are 
common to u and to plato such a 1 the uniti and correl of the 
scienc or rather of scienc for in plato s time they were not yet 
part off or distinguish 2 the exist of a divin power 
or life or idea or cau or reason not yet conceiv or no longer 
conceiv a in the timaeu and elsewh under the form of a person 
3 the recognit of the hypothet and condit charact of the 
mathemat scienc and in a measur of everi scienc when isol 
from the rest 4 the convict of a truth which is invi and of 
a law though hardli a law of natur which permeat the intellectu 
rather than the visibl world 

the method of socrat is hesit and tent await the fuller 
explan of the idea of good and of the natur of dialect in the 
seventh book the imperfect intellig of glaucon and the reluct 
of socrat to make a begin mark the difficulti of the subject 
the allu to theag bridl and to the intern oracl or demon 
sign of socrat which here a alway in plato is onli prohibitori 
the remark that the salvat of ani remnant of good in the present evil 
state of the world is due to god onli the refer to a futur state 
of exist which is unknown to glaucon in the tenth book and in 
which the discu of socrat and hi discipl would be resum 
the surpri in the answer the fanci ironi of socrat where 
he pretend that he can onli describ the strang posit of the 
philosoph in a figur of speech the origin observ that the 
sophist after all are onli the repr and not the leader 
of public opinion the pictur of the philosoph stand asid in the 
shower of sleet under a wall the figur of the great beast follow 
by the express of good will toward the common peopl who would not 
have reject the philosoph if they had known him the right nobl 
thought that the highest truth demand the greatest exact the 
hesit of socrat in return onc more to hi well worn theme of 
the idea of good the ludicr earnest of glaucon the comparison 
of philosophi to a desert maiden who marri beneath her are some of 
the most interest characterist of the sixth book 

yet a few more word may be ad on the old theme which wa so 
oft discu in the socrat circl of which we like glaucon and 
adeimantu would fain if possibl have a clearer notion like them 
we are dissatisfi when we are told that the idea of good can onli be 
reveal to a student of the mathemat scienc and we are inclin 
to think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path to 
ani satisfactori goal for we have learn that differ of quantiti 
cannot pa into differ of qualiti and that the mathemat 
scienc can never rise abov themselv into the sphere of our higher 
thought although they may sometim furnish symbol and express 
of them and may train the mind in habit of abstract and 
self concentr the illu which wa natur to an ancient 
philosoph ha cea to be an illu to u but if the process by 
which we are suppo to arriv at the idea of good be realli imaginari 
may not the idea itself be also a mere abstract we remark first 
that in all age and especi in primit philosophi word such 
a be essenc uniti good have exert an extraordinari influenc 
over the mind of men the meagr or neg of their content 
ha been in an inver ratio to their power they have becom the form 
under which all thing were comprehend there wa a need or instinct 
in the human soul which they satisfi they were not idea but god 
and to thi new mytholog the men of a later gener began to attach 
the power and associ of the elder deiti 

the idea of good is one of those sacr word or form of thought which 
were begin to take the place of the old mytholog it meant uniti 
in which all time and all exist were gather up it wa the truth 
of all thing and also the light in which they shone forth and becam 
evid to intellig human and divin it wa the cau of all 
thing the power by which they were brought into be it wa the 
univ reason divest of a human person it wa the life 
a well a the light of the world all knowledg and all power were 
comprehend in it the way to it wa through the mathemat scienc 
and these too were depend on it to ask whether god wa the maker of 
it or made by it would be like ask whether god could be conceiv 
apart from good or good apart from god the god of the timaeu 
is not realli at varianc with the idea of good they are aspect of 
the same differ onli a the person from the imperson or the 
masculin from the neuter the one be the express or languag of 
mytholog the other of philosophi 

thi or someth like thi is the mean of the idea of good a 
conceiv by plato idea of number order harmoni develop may 
also be said to enter into it the paraphra which ha just been given 
of it go beyond the actual word of plato we have perhap arriv at 
the stage of philosophi which enabl u to understand what he is aim 
at better than he did himself we are begin to realiz what he saw 
darkli and at a distanc but if he could have been told that thi or 
some concept of the same kind but higher than thi wa the truth 
at which he wa aim and the need which he sought to suppli he would 
gladli have recogn that more wa contain in hi own thought 
than he himself knew a hi word are few and hi manner retic 
and tent so must the style of hi interpret be we should not 
approach hi mean more nearli by attempt to defin it further in 
translat him into the languag of modern thought we might insen 
lose the spirit of ancient philosophi it is remark that although 
plato speak of the idea of good a the first principl of truth and 
be it is nowher mention in hi write except in thi passag 
nor did it retain ani hold upon the mind of hi discipl in a later 
gener it wa probabl unintellig to them nor doe the mention 
of it in aristotl appear to have ani refer to thi or ani other 
passag in hi extant write 

book vii and now i will describ in a figur the enlighten or 
unenlighten of our natur imagin human be live in an 
underground den which is open toward the light they have been there 
from childhood have their neck and leg chain and can onli see 
into the den at a distanc there is a fire and between the fire and 
the prison a rai way and a low wall is built along the way like 
the screen over which marionett player show their puppet behind the 
wall appear move figur who hold in their hand variou work of 
art and among them imag of men and anim wood and stone and some 
of the passer by are talk and other silent a strang parabl 
he said and strang captiv they are ourselv i repli and they 
see onli the shadow of the imag which the fire throw on the wall of 
the den to these they give name and if we add an echo which return 
from the wall the voic of the passeng will seem to proceed from 
the shadow suppo now that you suddenli turn them round and make them 
look with pain and grief to themselv at the real imag will they 
believ them to be real will not their eye be dazzl and will they 
not tri to get away from the light to someth which they are abl to 
behold without blink and suppo further that they are drag up 
a steep and rug ascent into the presenc of the sun himself will not 
their sight be darken with the excess of light some time will pa 
befor they get the habit of perceiv at all and at first they will 
be abl to perceiv onli shadow and reflect in the water then they 
will recogn the moon and the star and will at length behold the sun 
in hi own proper place a he is last of all they will conclud thi 
is he who give u the year and the season and is the author of all 
that we see how will they rejoic in pa from dark to light 
how worthless to them will seem the honour and glori of the den but 
now imagin further that they descend into their old habit in 
that underground dwell they will not see a well a their fellow 
and will not be abl to compet with them in the measur of the 
shadow on the wall there will be mani joke about the man who went on 
a visit to the sun and lost hi eye and if they find anybodi tri to 
set free and enlighten one of their number they will put him to death 
if they can catch him now the cave or den is the world of sight the 
fire is the sun the way upward is the way to knowledg and in the 
world of knowledg the idea of good is last seen and with difficulti 
but when seen is infer to be the author of good and right parent of 
the lord of light in thi world and of truth and understand in the 
other he who attain to the beatif vision is alway go upward he 
is unwil to descend into polit assembl and court of law for 
hi eye are apt to blink at the imag or shadow of imag which they 
behold in them he cannot enter into the idea of those who have never 
in their life understood the relat of the shadow to the substanc 
but blind is of two kind and may be cau either by pa out 
of dark into light or out of light into dark and a man of sen 
will distinguish between them and will not laugh equal at both of 
them but the blind which ari from ful of light he will deem 
bless and piti the other or if he laugh at the puzzl soul look 
at the sun he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabit 
of the den at those who descend from abov there is a further lesson 
taught by thi parabl of our some person fanci that instruct is 
like give eye to the blind but we say that the faculti of sight wa 
alway there and that the soul onli requir to be turn round toward 
the light and thi is conver other virtu are almost like bodili 
habit and may be acquir in the same manner but intellig ha 
a divin life and is indestruct turn either to good or evil 
accord to the direct given did you never observ how the mind of 
a clever rogu peer out of hi eye and the more clearli he see the 
more evil he doe now if you take such an one and cut away from him 
those leaden weight of pleasur and desir which bind hi soul to 
earth hi intellig will be turn round and he will behold the 
truth a clearli a he now discern hi meaner end and have we not 
decid that our ruler must neither be so uneduc a to have no 
fix rule of life nor so over educ a to be unwil to leav 
their paradi for the busi of the world we must choo out 
therefor the natur who are most like to ascend to the light and 
knowledg of the good but we must not allow them to remain in the 
region of light they must be forc down again among the captiv in 
the den to partak of their labour and honour will they not think 
thi a hardship you should rememb that our purpo in frame the 
state wa not that our citizen should do what they like but that they 
should serv the state for the common good of all may we not fairli 
say to our philosoph friend we do you no wrong for in other state 
philosophi grow wild and a wild plant owe noth to the garden 
but you have been train by u to be the ruler and king of our hive 
and therefor we must insist on your descend into the den you must 
each of you take your turn and becom abl to use your eye in the 
dark and with a littl practic you will see far better than those who 
quarrel about the shadow whose knowledg is a dream onli whilst your 
is a wake realiti it may be that the saint or philosoph who is best 
fit may also be the least inclin to rule but necess is laid 
upon him and he must no longer live in the heaven of idea and thi 
will be the salvat of the state for those who rule must not be those 
who are desir to rule and if you can offer to our citizen a better 
life than that of ruler gener is there will be a chanc that the 
rich not onli in thi world s good but in virtu and wisdom may 
bear rule and the onli life which is better than the life of polit 
ambit is that of philosophi which is also the best prepar for 
the govern of a state 

then now come the question how shall we creat our ruler what way 
is there from dark to light the chang is effect by philosophi 
it is not the turn over of an oyster shell but the conver of a 
soul from night to day from becom to be and what train will 
draw the soul upward our former educ had two branch gymnast 
which wa occupi with the bodi and music the sister art which 
infu a natur harmoni into mind and literatur but neither of these 
scienc gave ani promi of do what we want noth remain to u 
but that univ or primari scienc of which all the art and scienc 
are partak i mean number or calcul veri true includ the 
art of war ye certainli then there is someth ludicr about 
palam in the tragedi come in and say that he had invent 
number and had count the rank and set them in order for if 
agamemnon could not count hi foot and without number how could he 
he must have been a pretti sort of gener ind no man should be a 
soldier who cannot count and ind he is hardli to be call a man 
but i am not speak of these practic applic of arithmet for 
number in my view is rather to be regard a a conductor to thought 
and be i will explain what i mean by the last express thing 
sensibl are of two kind the one class invit or stimul the mind 
while in the other the mind acquiesc now the stimul class are 
the thing which suggest contrast and relat for exampl suppo 
that i hold up to the eye three finger a fore finger a middl 
finger a littl finger the sight equal recogn all three finger 
but without number cannot further distinguish them or again suppo 
two object to be rel great and small these idea of great 
and small are suppli not by the sen but by the mind and the 
percept of their contrast or relat quicken and set in motion 
the mind which is puzzl by the confu intim of sen and ha 
recour to number in order to find out whether the thing indic are 
one or more than one number repli that they are two and not one and 
are to be distinguish from one anoth again the sight behold 
great and small but onli in a confu chao and not until they are 
distinguish doe the question ari of their respect natur we 
are thu led on to the distinct between the visibl and intellig 
that wa what i meant when i spoke of stimul to the intellect i wa 
think of the contradict which ari in percept the idea 
of uniti for exampl like that of a finger doe not arou thought 
unless involv some concept of plural but when the one is also 
the opposit of one the contradict give rise to reflect an 
exampl of thi is afford by ani object of sight all number ha also 
an elev effect it rai the mind out of the foam and flux of 
gener to the contempl of be have lesser militari and 
retail u also the retail use is not requir by u but a our 
guardian is to be a soldier a well a a philosoph the militari one 
may be retain and to our higher purpo no scienc can be better 
adapt but it must be pursu in the spirit of a philosoph not of a 
shopkeep it is concern not with visibl object but with abstract 
truth for number are pure abstract the true arithmetician 
indignantli deni that hi unit is capabl of divi when you 
divid he insist that you are onli multipli hi one is not 
materi or resolv into fraction but an unvari and absolut 
equal and thi prof the pure intellectu charact of hi 
studi note also the great power which arithmet ha of sharpen the 
wit no other disciplin is equal sever or an equal test of gener 
abil or equal improv to a stupid person 

let our second branch of educ be geometri i can easili see 
repli glaucon that the skill of the gener will be doubl by hi 
knowledg of geometri that is a small matter the use of geometri to 
which i refer is the assist given by it in the contempl of the 
idea of good and the compel the mind to look at true be and not 
at gener onli yet the present mode of pursu these studi 
a ani one who is the least of a mathematician is awar is mean and 
ridicul they are made to look downward to the art and not upward 
to etern exist the geomet is alway talk of squar 
subtend appo a if he had in view action wherea knowledg is 
the real object of the studi it should elev the soul and creat 
the mind of philosophi it should rai up what ha fallen down not to 
speak of lesser u in war and militari tactic and in the improv 
of the faculti 

shall we propo a a third branch of our educ astronomi veri 
good repli glaucon the knowledg of the heaven is necessari at 
onc for husbandri navig militari tactic i like your way of 
give use reason for everyth in order to make friend of the 
world and there is a difficulti in prove to mankind that educ is 
not onli use inform but a purif of the eye of the soul 
which is better than the bodili eye for by thi alon is truth seen 
now will you appeal to mankind in gener or to the philosoph or 
would you prefer to look to yourself onli everi man is hi own best 
friend then take a step backward for we are out of order and insert 
the third dimen which is of solid after the second which is of 
plane and then you may proceed to solid in motion but solid geometri 
is not popular and ha not the patronag of the state nor is the use 
of it fulli recogn the difficulti is great and the votari of the 
studi are conceit and impati still the charm of the pursuit win 
upon men and if govern would lend a littl assist there 
might be great progress made veri true repli glaucon but do 
i understand you now to begin with plane geometri and to place next 
geometri of solid and thirdli astronomi or the motion of solid 
ye i said my hasti ha onli hinder u 

veri good and now let u proceed to astronomi about which i am 
will to speak in your lofti strain no one can fail to see that the 
contempl of the heaven draw the soul upward i am an except 
then astronomi a studi at present appear to me to draw the soul 
not upward but downward star gaze is just look up at the 
ceil no better a man may lie on hi back on land or on water he 
may look up or look down but there is no scienc in that the vision of 
knowledg of which i speak is seen not with the eye but with the mind 
all the magnif of the heaven is but the embroideri of a copi 
which fall far short of the divin origin and teach noth about 
the absolut harmoni or motion of thing their beauti is like the 
beauti of figur drawn by the hand of daedalu or ani other great 
artist which may be use for illustr but no mathematician would 
seek to obtain from them true concept of equal or numer 
relat how ridicul then to look for these in the map of the 
heaven in which the imperfect of matter come in everywh a a 
disturb element mar the symmetri of day and night of month and 
year of the sun and star in their cour onli by problem can we 
place astronomi on a truli scientif basi let the heaven alon and 
exert the intellect 

still mathemat admit of other applic a the pythagorean say 
and we agr there is a sister scienc of harmon motion adapt to 
the ear a astronomi is to the eye and there may be other applic 
also let u inquir of the pythagorean about them not forget 
that we have an aim higher than their which is the relat of these 
scienc to the idea of good the error which pervad astronomi also 
pervad harmon the musician put their ear in the place of their 
mind ye repli glaucon i like to see them lay their ear 
alongsid of their neighbour face some say that s a new note 
other declar that the two note are the same ye i said but you 
mean the empir who are alway twist and tortur the string 
of the lyre and quarrel about the temper of the string i am 
refer rather to the pythagorean harmonist who are almost equal 
in error for they investig onli the number of the conson which 
are heard and ascend no higher of the true numer harmoni which 
is unheard and is onli to be found in problem they have not even a 
concept that last he said must be a marvel thing a thing 
i repli which is onli use if pursu with a view to the good 

all these scienc are the prelud of the strain and are profit 
if they are regard in their natur relat to one anoth i 
dare say socrat said glaucon but such a studi will be an endless 
busi what studi do you mean of the prelud or what for all 
these thing are onli the prelud and you sure do not suppo that a 
mere mathematician is also a dialectician certainli not i have hardli 
ever known a mathematician who could reason and yet glaucon is 
not true reason that hymn of dialect which is the music of the 
intellectu world and which wa by u compar to the effort of sight 
when from behold the shadow on the wall we arriv at last at 
the imag which gave the shadow even so the dialect faculti 
withdraw from sen arriv by the pure intellect at the 
contempl of the idea of good and never rest but at the veri end 
of the intellectu world and the royal road out of the cave into 
the light and the blink of the eye at the sun and turn to 
contempl the shadow of realiti not the shadow of an imag 
onli thi progress and gradual acquisit of a new faculti of sight by 
the help of the mathemat scienc is the elev of the soul to 
the contempl of the highest ideal of be 

so far i agr with you but now leav the prelud let u proceed 
to the hymn what then is the natur of dialect and what are the 
path which lead thither dear glaucon you cannot follow me here 
there can be no revel of the absolut truth to one who ha not been 
disciplin in the previou scienc but that there is a scienc of 
absolut truth which is attain in some way veri differ from 
those now practi i am confid for all other art or scienc are 
rel to human need and opinion and the mathemat scienc are 
but a dream or hypothesi of true be and never anali their own 
principl dialect alon rise to the principl which is abov 
hypothesi convert and gentli lead the eye of the soul out of the 
barbar slough of ignor into the light of the upper world with 
the help of the scienc which we have been describ scienc a 
they are often term although they requir some other name impli 
greater clear than opinion and le clear than scienc and thi 
in our previou sketch wa understand and so we get four name two 
for intellect and two for opinion reason or mind understand 
faith percept of shadow which make a proport 
be becom intellect opinion and scienc belief understand 
percept of shadow dialect may be further describ a that 
scienc which defin and explain the essenc or be of each natur 
which distinguish and abstract the good and is readi to do battl 
against all oppon in the cau of good to him who is not a 
dialectician life is but a sleepi dream and mani a man is in hi grave 
befor hi is well wake up and would you have the futur ruler of 
your ideal state intellig be or stupid a post certainli not 
the latter then you must train them in dialect which will teach 
them to ask and answer question and is the cope stone of the 
scienc 

i dare say that you have not forgotten how our ruler were chosen and 
the process of select may be carri a step further a befor they 
must be constant and valiant good look and of nobl manner but 
now they must also have natur abil which educ will improv 
that is to say they must be quick at learn capabl of mental toil 
retent solid dilig natur who combin intellectu with 
moral virtu not lame and one side dilig in bodili exerci 
and indol in mind or conver not a maim soul which hate 
falsehood and yet unint is alway wallow in the mire of 
ignor not a bastard or feebl person but sound in wind and limb 
and in perfect condit for the great gymnast trial of the mind 
justic herself can find no fault with natur such a these and they 
will be the saviour of our state discipl of anoth sort would 
onli make philosophi more ridicul than she is at present forgiv 
my enthusiasm i am becom excit but when i see her trampl 
underfoot i am angri at the author of her disgrac i did not notic 
that you were more excit than you ought to have been but i felt that 
i wa now do not let u forget anoth point in the select of our 
discipl that they must be young and not old for solon is mistaken 
in say that an old man can be alway learn youth is the time of 
studi and here we must rememb that the mind is free and dainti and 
unlik the bodi must not be made to work against the grain learn 
should be at first a sort of play in which the natur bent is 
detect a in train them for war the young dog should at first 
onli tast blood but when the necessari gymnast are over which 
dure two or three year divid life between sleep and bodili exerci 
then the educ of the soul will becom a more seriou matter at 
twenti year of age a select must be made of the more promi 
discipl with whom a new epoch of educ will begin the scienc 
which they have hitherto learn in fragment will now be brought into 
relat with each other and with true be for the power of combin 
them is the test of specul and dialect abil and afterward 
at thirti a further select shall be made of those who are abl to 
withdraw from the world of sen into the abstract of idea but 
at thi point judg from present experi there is a danger that 
dialect may be the sourc of mani evil the danger may be illustr 
by a parallel case imagin a person who ha been brought up in wealth 
and luxuri amid a crowd of flatter and who is suddenli inform that 
he is a supposit son he ha hitherto honour hi reput parent 
and disregard the flatter and now he doe the rever thi is 
just what happen with a man s principl there are certain doctrin 
which he learnt at home and which exerci a parent author 
over him present he find that imput are cast upon them a 
troublesom querist come and ask what is the just and good 
or prof that virtu is vice and vice virtu and hi mind becom 
unsettl and he cea to love honour and obey them a he ha 
hitherto done he is seduc into the life of pleasur and becom 
a lawless person and a rogu the case of such specul is veri 
pitiabl and in order that our thirti year old pupil may not 
requir thi piti let u take everi possibl care that young person do 
not studi philosophi too earli for a young man is a sort of puppi 
who onli play with an argument and is reason into and out of hi 
opinion everi day he soon begin to believ noth and bring 
himself and philosophi into discredit a man of thirti doe not run 
on in thi way he will argu and not mere contradict and add new 
honour to philosophi by the sobrieti of hi conduct what time shall we 
allow for thi second gymnast train of the soul say twice the 
time requir for the gymnast of the bodi six or perhap five 
year to commenc at thirti and then for fifteen year let the student 
go down into the den and command armi and gain experi of life 
at fifti let him return to the end of all thing and have hi eye 
uplift to the idea of good and order hi life after that pattern if 
necessari take hi turn at the helm of state and train up other 
to be hi successor when hi time come he shall depart in peac to 
the island of the blest he shall be honour with sacrif and 
receiv such worship a the pythian oracl approv 

you are a statuari socrat and have made a perfect imag of our 
governor ye and of our gover for the woman will share in 
all thing with the men and you will admit that our state is not a 
mere aspir but may realli come into be when there shall ari 
philosoph king one or more who will despi earthli vaniti and 
will be the servant of justic onli and how will they begin their 
work their first act will be to send away into the countri all those 
who are more than ten year of age and to proceed with those who are 
left 

at the commenc of the sixth book plato anticip hi explan 
of the relat of the philosoph to the world in an allegori in 
thi a in other passag follow the order which he prescrib 
in educ and proceed from the concret to the abstract at the 
commenc of book vii under the figur of a cave have an open 
toward a fire and a way upward to the true light he return to view 
the divi of knowledg exhibit familiarli a in a pictur the 
result which had been hardli won by a great effort of thought in the 
previou discu at the same time cast a glanc onward at the 
dialect process which is repr by the way lead from 
dark to light the shadow the imag the reflect of the 
sun and star in the water the star and sun themselv sever 
correspond the first to the realm of fanci and poetri the second 
to the world of sen the third to the abstract or univ of 
sen of which the mathemat scienc furnish the type the fourth 
and last to the same abstract when seen in the uniti of the idea 
from which they deriv a new mean and power the true dialect 
process begin with the contempl of the real star and not mere 
reflect of them and end with the recognit of the sun or idea 
of good a the parent not onli of light but of warmth and growth 
to the divi of knowledg the stage of educ partli 
answer first there is the earli educ of childhood and youth 
in the fanci of the poet and in the law and custom of the 
state then there is the train of the bodi to be a warrior athlet 
and a good servant of the mind and thirdli after an interv follow 
the educ of later life which begin with mathemat and proce 
to philosophi in gener 

there seem to be two great aim in the philosophi of plato first to 
realiz abstract secondli to connect them accord to him the 
true educ is that which draw men from becom to be and to 
a comprehen survey of all be he desir to develop in the human 
mind the faculti of see the univ in all thing until at last 
the particular of sen drop away and the univ alon remain he 
then seek to combin the univ which he ha disengag from sen 
not perceiv that the correl of them ha no other basi but the 
common use of languag he never understand that abstract a hegel 
say are mere abstract of use when employ in the arrang 
of fact but ad noth to the sum of knowledg when pursu apart 
from them or with refer to an imaginari idea of good still the 
exerci of the faculti of abstract apart from fact ha enlarg the 
mind and play a great part in the educ of the human race 
plato appreci the valu of thi faculti and saw that it might be 
quicken by the studi of number and relat all thing in which 
there is opposit or proport are suggest of reflect the 
mere impress of sen evok no power of thought or of mind but when 
sensibl object ask to be compar and distinguish then philosophi 
begin the scienc of arithmet first suggest such distinct the 
follow in order the other scienc of plain and solid geometri and of 
solid in motion one branch of which is astronomi or the harmoni of 
the sphere to thi is append the sister scienc of the harmoni 
of sound plato seem also to hint at the possibl of other 
applic of arithmet or mathemat proport such a we 
employ in chemistri and natur philosophi such a the pythagorean and 
even aristotl make use of in ethic and polit e g hi distinct 
between arithmet and geometr proport in the ethic book v 
or between numer and proport equal in the polit 

the modern mathematician will readili sympathi with plato s delight 
in the properti of pure mathemat he will not be disinclin to say 
with him let alon the heaven and studi the beauti of number and 
figur in themselv he too will be apt to depreci their applic 
to the art he will observ that plato ha a concept of geometri 
in which figur are to be dispen with thu in a distant and 
shadowi way seem to anticip the possibl of work geometr 
problem by a more gener mode of analysi he will remark with 
interest on the backward state of solid geometri which ala wa not 
encourag by the aid of the state in the age of plato and he will 
recogn the grasp of plato s mind in hi abil to conceiv of 
one scienc of solid in motion includ the earth a well a the 
heaven not forget to notic the intim to which allu ha 
been alreadi made that besid astronomi and harmon the scienc 
of solid in motion may have other applic still more will he be 
struck with the comprehen of view which led plato at a time 
when these scienc hardli exist to say that they must be studi in 
relat to one anoth and to the idea of good or common principl 
of truth and be but he will also see and perhap without surpri 
that in that stage of physic and mathemat knowledg plato ha 
fallen into the error of suppo that he can construct the heaven a 
priori by mathemat problem and determin the principl of harmoni 
irrespect of the adapt of sound to the human ear the illu 
wa a natur one in that age and countri the simplic and certainti 
of astronomi and harmon seem to contrast with the variat and 
complex of the world of sen henc the circumst that there wa 
some elementari basi of fact some measur of distanc or time or 
vibrat on which they must ultim rest wa overlook by him 
the modern predecessor of newton fell into error equal great and 
plato can hardli be said to have been veri far wrong or may even claim 
a sort of prophet insight into the subject when we consid that 
the greater part of astronomi at the present day consist of abstract 
dynam by the help of which most astronom discoveri have been 
made 

the metaphi philosoph from hi point of view recogn 
mathemat a an instrument of educ which strengthen the 
power of attent develop the sen of order and the faculti of 
construct and enabl the mind to grasp under simpl formula the 
quantit differ of physic phenomenon but while acknowledg 
their valu in educ he see also that they have no connexion with 
our higher moral and intellectu idea in the attempt which plato 
make to connect them we easili trace the influenc of ancient 
pythagorean notion there is no reason to suppo that he is speak 
of the ideal number but he is describ number which are pure 
abstract to which he assign a real and separ exist which 
a the teacher of the art mean probabl the pythagorean would 
have affirm repel all attempt at subdivi and in which uniti and 
everi other number are conceiv of a absolut the truth and certainti 
of number when thu disengag from phenomenon gave them a kind of 
sacr in the eye of an ancient philosoph nor is it easi to say 
how far idea of order and fix may have had a moral and elev 
influenc on the mind of men who in the word of the timaeu 
might learn to regul their er life accord to them it is 
worthi of remark that the old pythagorean ethic symbol still exist a 
figur of speech among ourselv and those who in modern time see the 
world pervad by univ law may also see an anticip of thi 
last word of modern philosophi in the platon idea of good which 
is the sourc and measur of all thing and yet onli an abstract 
philebu 

two passag seem to requir more particular explan first that 
which relat to the analysi of vision the difficulti in thi passag 
may be explain like mani other from differ in the mode of 
concept prevail among ancient and modern thinker to u the 
percept of sen are insepar from the act of the mind which 
accompani them the consciou of form colour distanc is 
indistinguish from the simpl sensat which is the medium of 
them wherea to plato sen is the heraclitean flux of sen not the 
vision of object in the order in which they actual present themselv 
to the experienc sight but a they may be imagin to appear confu 
and blur to the half awaken eye of the infant the first action of 
the mind is arou by the attempt to set in order thi chao and 
the reason is requir to frame distinct concept under which 
the confu impress of sen may be arrang henc ari 
the question what is great what is small and thu begin the 
distinct of the visibl and the intellig 

the second difficulti relat to plato s concept of harmon 
three class of harmonist are distinguish by him first the 
pythagorean whom he propo to consult a in the previou discu 
on music he wa to consult damon they are acknowledg to be master 
in the art but are altogeth defici in the knowledg of it higher 
import and relat to the good secondli the mere empir whom 
glaucon appear to confu with them and whom both he and socrat 
ludicr describ a experi by mere auscult on the 
interv of sound both of these fall short in differ degr of 
the platon idea of harmoni which must be studi in a pure 
abstract way first by the method of problem and secondli a a part of 
univ knowledg in relat to the idea of good 

the allegori ha a polit a well a a philosoph mean the 
den or cave repr the narrow sphere of polit or law compar the 
descript of the philosoph and lawyer in the theaetetu and 
the light of the etern idea is suppo to exerci a disturb 
influenc on the mind of those who return to thi lower world in other 
word their principl are too wide for practic applic they are 
look far away into the past and futur when their busi is with 
the present the ideal is not easili reduc to the condit of actual 
life and may often be at varianc with them and at first those who 
return are unabl to compet with the inhabit of the den in the 
measur of the shadow and are derid and persecut by them but 
after a while they see the thing below in far truer proport than 
those who have never ascend into the upper world the differ 
between the politician turn into a philosoph and the philosoph 
turn into a politician is symbol by the two kind of disord 
eyesight the one which is experienc by the captiv who is transfer 
from dark to day the other of the heavenli messeng who 
voluntarili for the good of hi fellow men descend into the den in 
what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabit of the lower 
world or how the idea of good is to becom the guid principl of 
polit is left unexplain by plato like the natur and divi of 
dialect of which glaucon impati demand to be inform perhap 
he would have said that the explan could not be given except to a 
discipl of the previou scienc symposium 

mani illustr of thi part of the republ may be found in modern 
polit and in daili life for among ourselv too there have 
been two sort of politician or statesman whose eyesight ha becom 
disord in two differ way first there have been great men who 
in the languag of burk have been too much given to gener 
maxim who like j s mill or burk himself have been theorist or 
philosoph befor they were politician or who have been student 
of histori have allow some great histor parallel such a the 
english revolut of 1688 or possibl athenian democraci or roman 
imperi to be the medium through which they view contemporari 
event or perhap the long project shadow of some exist 
institut may have darken their vision the church of the futur 
the commonwealth of the futur the societi of the futur have 
so absorb their mind that they are unabl to see in their true 
proport the polit of to day they have been intox with 
great idea such a liberti or equal or the greatest happi of 
the greatest number or the brotherhood of human and they no 
longer care to consid how these idea must be limit in practic or 
harmon with the condit of human life they are full of light 
but the light to them ha becom onli a sort of lumin mist or 
blind almost everi one ha known some enthusiast half educ 
person who see everyth at fal distanc and in erron 
proport 

with thi disord of eyesight may be contrast anoth of those who 
see not far into the distanc but what is near onli who have been 
engag all their life in a trade or a profess who are limit to 
a set or sect of their own men of thi kind have no univ except 
their own interest or the interest of their class no principl but 
the opinion of person like themselv no knowledg of affair beyond 
what they pick up in the street or at their club suppo them to be 
sent into a larger world to undertak some higher call from be 
tradesman to turn gener or politician from be schoolmast to 
becom philosoph or imagin them on a sudden to receiv an inward 
light which reveal to them for the first time in their life a higher 
idea of god and the exist of a spiritu world by thi sudden 
conver or chang is not their daili life like to be upset and on 
the other hand will not mani of their old prejud and narrow 
still adher to them long after they have begun to take a more 
comprehen view of human thing from familiar exampl like these we 
may learn what plato meant by the eyesight which is liabl to two kind 
of disord 

nor have we ani difficulti in draw a parallel between the young 
athenian in the fifth centuri befor christ who becam unsettl by new 
idea and the student of a modern univ who ha been the subject 
of a similar aufklarung we too observ that when young men begin to 
critici customari belief or to anali the constitut of human 
natur they are apt to lose hold of solid principl greek they are 
like tree which have been frequent transplant the earth about them 
is loo and they have no root reach far into the soil they light 
upon everi flower follow their own wayward will or becau the 
wind blow them they catch opinion a disea are caught when 
they are in the air born hither and thither they speedili fall 
into belief the opposit of those in which they were brought up they 
hardli retain the distinct of right and wrong they seem to think one 
thing a good a anoth they suppo themselv to be search after 
truth when they are play the game of follow my leader they fall 
in love at first sight with paradox respect moral some fanci 
about art some novelti or eccentr in religion and like lover 
they are so absorb for a time in their new notion that they can think 
of noth el the resolut of some philosoph or theolog 
question seem to them more interest and import than ani 
substanti knowledg of literatur or scienc or even than a good life 
like the youth in the philebu they are readi to discour to ani one 
about a new philosophi they are gener the discipl of some emin 
professor or sophist whom they rather imit than understand they may 
be count happi if in later year they retain some of the simpl truth 
which they acquir in earli educ and which they may perhap 
find to be worth all the rest such is the pictur which plato draw and 
which we onli reproduc partli in hi own word of the danger which 
beset youth in time of transit when old opinion are fade 
away and the new are not yet firmli establish their condit is 
ingeni compar by him to that of a supposit son who ha 
made the discoveri that hi reput parent are not hi real one and 
in consequ they have lost their author over him 

the distinct between the mathematician and the dialectician is 
also notic plato is veri well awar that the faculti of the 
mathematician is quit distinct from the higher philosoph sen 
which recogn and combin first principl the contempt which 
he express for distinct of word the danger of involuntari 
falsehood the apolog which socrat make for hi earnest of 
speech are highli characterist of the platon style and mode of 
thought the quaint notion that if palam wa the inventor of number 
agamemnon could not have count hi foot the art by which we are made 
to believ that thi state of our is not a dream onli the graviti 
with which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the state 
name the send out of the citi all who had arriv at ten year of 
age in order to expedit the busi of educ by a gener are 
also truli platon for the last compar the passag at the end of 
the third book in which he expect the lie about the earthborn men to 
be believ in the second gener 

book viii and so we have arriv at the conclu that in the perfect 
state wife and child are to be in common and the educ and 
pursuit of men and woman both in war and peac are to be common and 
king are to be philosoph and warrior and the soldier of the state 
are to live togeth have all thing in common and they are to be 
warrior athlet receiv no pay but onli their food from the other 
citizen now let u return to the point at which we digress that is 
easili done he repli you were speak of the state which you had 
construct and of the individu who answer to thi both of whom 
you affirm to be good and you said that of inferior state there were 
four form and four individu correspond to them which although 
defici in variou degr were all of them worth inspect with 
a view to determin the rel happi or miseri of the best or 
worst man then polemarchu and adeimantu interrupt you and thi led 
to anoth argument and so here we are suppo that we put ourselv 
again in the same posit and do you repeat your question i should 
like to know of what constitut you were speak besid the 
perfect state there are onli four of ani note in hella first the 
famou lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth secondli oligarchi a 
state full of evil thirdli democraci which follow next in order 
fourthli tyranni which is the disea or death of all govern 
now state are not made of oak and rock but of flesh and blood and 
therefor a there are five state there must be five human natur in 
individu which correspond to them and first there is the ambiti 
natur which answer to the lacedaemonian state secondli the 
oligarch natur thirdli the democrat and fourthli the 
tyrann thi last will have to be compar with the perfectli just 
which is the fifth that we may know which is the happier and then we 
shall be abl to determin whether the argument of thrasymachu or our 
own is the more convinc and a befor we began with the state and 
went on to the individu so now begin with timocraci let u 
go on to the timocrat man and then proceed to the other form of 
govern and the individu who answer to them 

but how did timocraci ari out of the perfect state plainli like 
all chang of govern from divi in the ruler but whenc came 
divi sing heavenli muse a homer say let them condescend to 
answer u a if we were child to whom they put on a solemn face 
in jest and what will they say they will say that human thing are 
fate to decay and even the perfect state will not escap from thi 
law of destini when the wheel come full circl in a period short or 
long plant or anim have time of fertil and steril which the 
intellig of ruler becau alloy by sen will not enabl them to 
ascertain and child will be born out of season for wherea divin 
creation are in a perfect cycl or number the human creation is in 
a number which declin from perfect and ha four term and three 
interv of number increa wane assimil dissimil 
and yet perfectli commensur with each other the base of the number 
with a fourth ad or which is 3 4 multipli by five and cube 
give two harmoni the first a squar number which is a hundr 
time the base or a hundr time a hundr the second an oblong 
be a hundr squar of the ration diamet of a figur the side of 
which is five subtract one from each squar or two perfect squar 
from all and ad a hundr cube of three thi entir number is 
geometr and contain the rule or law of gener when thi law is 
neglect marriag will be unprop the inferior offspr who are 
then born will in time becom the ruler the state will declin and 
educ fall into decay gymnast will be prefer to music and 
the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass thu 
divi will ari such is the muse answer to our question and a 
true answer of cour but what more have they to say they say that 
the two race the iron and brass and the silver and gold will draw 
the state differ way the one will take to trade and moneymak 
and the other have the true rich and not care for money will 
resist them the contest will end in a compromi they will agr to 
have privat properti and will enslav their fellow citizen who were 
onc their friend and nurtur but they will retain their warlik 
charact and will be chiefli occupi in fight and exerci rule 
thu ari timocraci which is intermedi between aristocraci and 
oligarchi 

the new form of govern resembl the ideal in obedi to ruler 
and contempt for trade and have common meal and in devot 
to warlik and gymnast exerci but corrupt ha crept into 
philosophi and simplic of charact which wa onc her note is now 
look for onli in the militari class art of war begin to prevail over 
art of peac the ruler is no longer a philosoph a in oligarchi 
there spring up among them an extravag love of gain get anoth 
man s and save your own is their principl and they have dark place 
in which they hoard their gold and silver for the use of their woman 
and other they take their pleasur by stealth like boy who are 
run away from their father the law and their educ is not 
inspir by the muse but impo by the strong arm of power the 
lead characterist of thi state is parti spirit and ambit 

and what manner of man answer to such a state in love of content 
repli adeimantu he will be like our friend glaucon in that 
respect perhap but not in other he is self assert and 
ill educ yet fond of literatur although not himself a 
speaker fierc with slave but obedi to ruler a lover of power 
and honour which he hope to gain by deed of arm fond too of 
gymnast and of hunt a he advanc in year he grow avarici 
for he ha lost philosophi which is the onli saviour and guardian of 
men hi origin is a follow hi father is a good man dwell in an 
ill order state who ha retir from polit in order that he may 
lead a quiet life hi mother is angri at her loss of prece among 
other woman she is disgust at her husband s selfish and she 
expati to her son on the unmanli and indol of hi father 
the old famili servant take up the tale and say to the youth when 
you grow up you must be more of a man than your father all the world 
are agr that he who mind hi own busi is an idiot while a 
busybodi is highli honour and esteem the young man compar thi 
spirit with hi father s word and way and a he is natur well 
dispo although he ha suffer from evil influenc he rest at a 
middl point and becom ambiti and a lover of honour 

and now let u set anoth citi over against anoth man the next form 
of govern is oligarchi in which the rule is of the rich onli nor 
is it difficult to see how such a state ari the declin begin with 
the poss of gold and silver illeg mode of expenditur are 
invent one draw anoth on and the multitud are infect rich 
outweigh virtu lover of money take the place of lover of honour 
miser of politician and in time polit privileg are confin 
by law to the rich who do not shrink from violenc in order to effect 
their purpo 

thu much of the origin let u next consid the evil of oligarchi 
would a man who want to be safe on a voyag take a bad pilot becau 
he wa rich or refu a good one becau he wa poor and doe not the 
analog appli still more to the state and there are yet greater evil 
two nation are struggl togeth in one the rich and the poor and 
the rich dare not put arm into the hand of the poor and are unwil 
to pay for defend out of their own money and have we not alreadi 
condemn that state in which the same person are warrior a well 
a shopkeep the greatest evil of all is that a man may sell hi 
properti and have no place in the state while there is one class which 
ha enorm wealth the other is entir destitut but observ that 
these destitut had not realli ani more of the govern natur in them 
when they were rich than now that they are poor they were miser 
spendthrift alway they are the drone of the hive onli wherea the 
actual drone is unprovid by natur with a sting the two leg thing 
whom we call drone are some of them without sting and some of them 
have dread sting in other word there are pauper and there are 
rogu these are never far apart and in oligarch citi where 
nearli everybodi is a pauper who is not a ruler you will find abund 
of both and thi evil state of societi origin in bad educ and 
bad govern 

like state like man the chang in the latter begin with the 
repr of timocraci he walk at first in the way of hi 
father who may have been a statesman or gener perhap and 
present he see him fallen from hi high estat the victim of 
inform die in prison or exil or by the hand of the execut 
the lesson which he thu receiv make him cautiou he leaf 
polit repress hi pride and save penni avar is enthron a 
hi bosom s lord and assum the style of the great king the ration 
and spirit element sit humbl on the ground at either side the one 
immer in calcul the other absorb in the admir of 
wealth the love of honour turn to love of money the conver 
is instantan the man is mean save toil the slave of one 
passion which is the master of the rest is he not the veri imag of the 
state he ha had no educ or he would never have allow the blind 
god of rich to lead the danc within him and be uneduc he will 
have mani slavish desir some beggarli some knavish breed in hi 
soul if he is the trust of an orphan and ha the power to defraud 
he will soon prove that he is not without the will and that hi 
passion are onli restrain by fear and not by reason henc he lead a 
divid exist in which the better desir mostli prevail but when 
he is contend for prize and other distinct he is afraid to 
incur a loss which is to be repaid onli by barren honour in time of 
war he fight with a small part of hi resourc and usual keep hi 
money and lose the victori 

next come democraci and the democrat man out of oligarchi and 
the oligarch man insati avar is the rule passion of an 
oligarchi and they encourag expen habit in order that they may 
gain by the ruin of extravag youth thu men of famili often lose 
their properti or right of citizenship but they remain in the citi 
full of hatr against the new owner of their estat and ripe for 
revolut the usur with stoop walk pretend not to see them 
he pa by and leaf hi sting that is hi money in some other 
victim and mani a man ha to pay the parent or princip sum multipli 
into a famili of child and is reduc into a state of dronag by 
him the onli way of diminish the evil is either to limit a man in 
hi use of hi properti or to insist that he shall lend at hi own 
risk but the rule class do not want remedi they care onli for 
money and are a careless of virtu a the poorest of the citizen 
now there are occa on which the governor and the govern meet 
togeth at festiv on a journey voyag or fight the sturdi 
pauper find that in the hour of danger he is not despi he see 
the rich man puf and pant and draw the conclu which he 
privat impart to hi companion that our peopl are not good for 
much and a a sickli frame is made ill by a mere touch from without 
or sometim without extern impul is readi to fall to piec of 
itself so from the least cau or with none at all the citi fall ill 
and fight a battl for life or death and democraci come into power 
when the poor are the victor kill some and exil some and give 
equal share in the govern to all the rest 

the manner of life in such a state is that of democrat there is 
freedom and plain of speech and everi man doe what is right in 
hi own eye and ha hi own way of life henc ari the most variou 
develop of charact the state is like a piec of embroideri of 
which the colour and figur are the manner of men and there are mani 
who like woman and child prefer thi varieti to real beauti and 
excel the state is not one but mani like a bazaar at which you 
can buy anyth the great charm is that you may do a you like you 
may govern if you like let it alon if you like go to war and make 
peac if you feel dispo and all quit irrespect of anybodi 
el when you condemn men to death they remain aliv all the same a 
gentleman is desir to go into exil and he stalk about the street 
like a hero and nobodi see him or care for him observ too 
how grandli democraci set her foot upon all our fine theori of 
educ how littl she care for the train of her statesman the 
onli qualif which she demand is the profess of patriot 
such is democraci a plea lawless variou sort of govern 
distribut equal to equal and unequ alik 

let u now inspect the individu democrat and first a in the case 
of the state we will trace hi antec he is the son of a miserli 
oligarch and ha been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessari 
pleasur perhap i ought to explain thi latter term necessari 
pleasur are those which are good and which we cannot do without 
unnecessari pleasur are those which do no good and of which the 
desir might be erad by earli train for exampl the pleasur 
of eat and drink are necessari and healthi up to a certain point 
beyond that point they are alik hurt to bodi and mind and the 
excess may be avoid when in excess they may be rightli call 
expen pleasur in opposit to the use one and the drone a 
we call him is the slave of these unnecessari pleasur and desir 
wherea the miserli oligarch is subject onli to the necessari 

the oligarch chang into the democrat in the follow manner the 
youth who ha had a miserli bring up get a tast of the drone s 
honey he meet with wild companion who introduc him to everi new 
pleasur a in the state so in the individu there are alli on 
both side temptat from without and passion from within there is 
reason also and extern influenc of parent and friend in allianc 
with the oligarch principl and the two faction are in violent 
conflict with one anoth sometim the parti of order prevail but 
then again new desir and new disord ari and the whole mob of 
passion get poss of the acropoli that is to say the soul 
which they find void and unguard by true word and work falsehood 
and illu ascend to take their place the prodig go back into 
the countri of the lotophagi or drone and openli dwell there and if 
ani offer of allianc or parley of individu elder come from home 
the fal spirit shut the gate of the castl and permit no one to 
enter there is a battl and they gain the victori and straightway 
make allianc with the desir they banish modesti which they call 
folli and send temper over the border when the hou ha been 
swept and garnish they dress up the exil vice and crown them 
with garland bring them back under new name insol they call good 
breed anarchi freedom wast magnif impud courag such 
is the process by which the youth pa from the necessari pleasur to 
the unnecessari after a while he divid hi time imparti between 
them and perhap when he get older and the violenc of passion 
ha abat he restor some of the exil and life in a sort of 
equilibrium indulg first one pleasur and then anoth and if 
reason come and tell him that some pleasur are good and honour 
and other bad and vile he shake hi head and say that he can make 
no distinct between them thu he life in the fanci of the hour 
sometim he take to drink and then he turn abstain he practi 
in the gymnasium or he doe noth at all then again he would be a 
philosoph or a politician or again he would be a warrior or a man of 
busi he is 

everi thing by start and noth long 

there remain still the finest and fairest of all men and all 
state tyranni and the tyrant tyranni spring from democraci much a 
democraci spring from oligarchi both ari from excess the one from 
excess of wealth the other from excess of freedom the great natur 
good of life say the democrat is freedom and thi exclu love 
of freedom and regardless of everyth el is the cau of the 
chang from democraci to tyranni the state demand the strong wine of 
freedom and unless her ruler give her a plenti draught punish 
and insult them equal and fratern of governor and govern is 
the approv principl anarchi is the law not of the state onli but 
of privat hou and extend even to the anim father and son 
citizen and foreign teacher and pupil old and young are all on a 
level father and teacher fear their son and pupil and the wisdom 
of the young man is a match for the elder and the old imit the 
jaunti manner of the young becau they are afraid of be thought 
moro slave are on a level with their master and mistress and 
there is no differ between men and woman nay the veri anim in 
a democrat state have a freedom which is unknown in other place the 
she dog are a good a their she mistress and hor and as march 
along with digniti and run their nose against anybodi who come in 
their way that ha often been my experi at last the citizen 
becom so sensit that they cannot endur the yoke of law written or 
unwritten they would have no man call himself their master such is the 
gloriou begin of thing out of which tyranni spring gloriou 
ind but what is to follow the ruin of oligarchi is the ruin of 
democraci for there is a law of contrari the excess of freedom 
pa into the excess of slaveri and the greater the freedom the 
greater the slaveri you will rememb that in the oligarchi were found 
two class rogu and pauper whom we compar to drone with and 
without sting these two class are to the state what phlegm and bile 
are to the human bodi and the state physician or legisl must get 
rid of them just a the bee master keep the drone out of the hive 
now in a democraci too there are drone but they are more numer 
and more danger than in the oligarchi there they are inert and 
unpracti here they are full of life and anim and the keener 
sort speak and act while the other buzz about the bema and prevent 
their oppon from be heard and there is anoth class in 
democrat state of respect thrive individu who can be 
squeez when the drone have need of their poss there is 
moreov a third class who are the labour and the artisan and 
they make up the mass of the peopl when the peopl meet they 
are omnipot but they cannot be brought togeth unless they are 
attract by a littl honey and the rich are made to suppli the honey 
of which the demagogu keep the greater part themselv give a tast 
onli to the mob their victim attempt to resist they are driven mad 
by the sting of the drone and so becom downright oligarch in 
self defenc then follow inform and convict for treason the 
peopl have some protector whom they nur into great and from thi 
root the tree of tyranni spring the natur of the chang is indic 
in the old fabl of the templ of zeu lycaeu which tell how he who 
tast human flesh mix up with the flesh of other victim will turn 
into a wolf even so the protector who tast human blood and slay 
some and exil other with or without law who hint at abolit of 
debt and divi of land must either perish or becom a wolf that 
is a tyrant perhap he is driven out but he soon come back from 
exil and then if hi enemi cannot get rid of him by law mean 
they plot hi assassin thereupon the friend of the peopl make 
hi well known request to them for a bodi guard which they readili 
grant think onli of hi danger and not of their own now let the 
rich man make to himself wing for he will never run away again if he 
doe not do so then and the great protector have crush all hi 
rival stand proudli erect in the chariot of state a full blown 
tyrant let u enquir into the natur of hi happi 

in the earli day of hi tyranni he smile and beam upon everybodi he 
is not a dominu no not he he ha onli come to put an end to debt 
and the monopoli of land have got rid of foreign enemi he make 
himself necessari to the state by alway go to war he is thu 
enabl to depress the poor by heavi tax and so keep them at work 
and he can get rid of bolder spirit by hand them over to the enemi 
then come unpopular some of hi old associ have the courag to 
oppo him the consequ is that he ha to make a purgat of the 
state but unlik the physician who purg away the bad he must get 
rid of the high spirit the wise and the wealthi for he ha no choic 
between death and a life of shame and dishonour and the more hate he 
is the more he will requir trusti guard but how will he obtain them 
they will come flock like bird for pay will he not rather obtain 
them on the spot he will take the slave from their owner and make 
them hi bodi guard these are hi trust friend who admir and 
look up to him are not the tragic poet wise who magnifi and exalt the 
tyrant and say that he is wise by associ with the wise and are 
not their prai of tyranni alon a suffici reason whi we should 
exclud them from our state they may go to other citi and gather the 
mob about them with fine word and chang commonwealth into tyranni 
and democraci receiv honour and reward for their servic but 
the higher they and their friend ascend constitut hill the more 
their honour will fail and becom too asthmat to mount to return to 
the tyrant how will he support that rare armi of hi first by rob 
the templ of their treasur which will enabl him to lighten the 
tax then he will take all hi father s properti and spend it on 
hi companion male or femal now hi father is the demu and if the 
demu get angri and say that a great hulk son ought not to be a 
burden on hi parent and bid him and hi riotou crew begon then 
will the parent know what a monster he ha been nurtur and that the 
son whom he would fain expel is too strong for him you do not mean to 
say that he will beat hi father ye he will after have taken away 
hi arm then he is a parricid and a cruel unnatur son and the 
peopl have jump from the fear of slaveri into slaveri out of the 
smoke into the fire thu liberti when out of all order and reason 
pa into the worst form of servitud 

in the previou book plato ha describ the ideal state now he 
return to the pervert or declin form on which he had lightli 
touch at the end of book iv these he describ in a success of 
parallel between the individu and the state trace the origin of 
either in the state or individu which ha prece them he begin 
by ask the point at which he digress and is thu led shortli to 
recapitul the substanc of the three former book which also contain 
a parallel of the philosoph and the state 

of the first declin he give no intellig account he would not have 
like to admit the most probabl cau of the fall of hi ideal state 
which to u would appear to be the impract of commun or the 
natur antagon of the rule and subject class he throw a 
veil of mysteri over the origin of the declin which he attribut to 
ignor of the law of popul of thi law the famou geometr 
figur or number is the express like the ancient in gener he had 
no idea of the gradual perfect of man or of the educ of the 
human race hi ideal wa not to be attain in the cour of age but 
wa to spring in full armour from the head of the legisl when good 
law had been given he thought onli of the manner in which they were 
like to be corrupt or of how they might be fill up in detail or 
restor in accord with their origin spirit he appear not to 
have reflect upon the full mean of hi own word in the brief 
space of human life noth great can be accomplish or again a he 
afterward say in the law infinit time is the maker of citi the 
order of constitut which is adopt by him repr an order of 
thought rather than a success of time and may be consid a the 
first attempt to frame a philosophi of histori 

the first of these declin state is timocraci or the govern of 
soldier and lover of honour which answer to the spartan state thi 
is a govern of forc in which educ is not inspir by the 
muse but impo by the law and in which all the finer element of 
organ have disappear the philosoph himself ha lost the 
love of truth and the soldier who is of a simpler and honest natur 
rule in hi stead the individu who answer to timocraci ha some 
notic qualiti he is describ a ill educ but like the 
spartan a lover of literatur and although he is a harsh master to hi 
servant he ha no natur superior over them hi charact is 
base upon a reaction against the circumst of hi father who in 
a troubl citi ha retir from polit and hi mother who is 
dissatisfi at her own posit is alway urg him toward the life 
of polit ambit such a charact may have had thi origin and 
ind livi attribut the licinian law to a feminin jealousi of a 
similar kind but there is obviou no connect between the manner 
in which the timocrat state spring out of the ideal and the mere 
accid by which the timocrat man is the son of a retir statesman 

the two next stage in the declin of constitut have even le 
histor foundat for there is no trace in greek histori of a 
politi like the spartan or cretan pa into an oligarchi of wealth 
or of the oligarchi of wealth pa into a democraci the order of 
histori appear to be differ first in the homer time there is 
the royal or patriarch form of govern which a centuri or two 
later wa succeed by an oligarchi of birth rather than of wealth and 
in which wealth wa onli the accid of the hereditari poss of 
land and power sometim thi oligarch govern gave way to a 
govern base upon a qualif of properti which accord to 
aristotl s mode of use word would have been call a timocraci 
and thi in some citi a at athen becam the conduct medium to 
democraci but such wa not the necessari order of success in state 
nor ind can ani order be discern in the endless fluctuat of 
greek histori like the tide in the euripu except perhap in the 
almost uniform tendenc from monarchi to aristocraci in the earliest 
time at first sight there appear to be a similar inver in the 
last step of the platon success for tyranni instead of be the 
natur end of democraci in earli greek histori appear rather a a 
stage lead to democraci the reign of peisistratu and hi son is 
an episod which come between the legisl of solon and the 
constitut of cleisthen and some secret cau common to them all 
seem to have led the greater part of hella at her first appear 
in the dawn of histori e g athen argo corinth sicyon and nearli 
everi state with the except of sparta through a similar stage of 
tyranni which end either in oligarchi or democraci but then we must 
rememb that plato is describ rather the contemporari govern 
of the sicilian state which altern between democraci and tyranni 
than the ancient histori of athen or corinth 

the portrait of the tyrant himself is just such a the later greek 
delight to draw of phalari and dionysiu in which a in the life 
of mediaev saint or mythic hero the conduct and action of one 
were attribut to anoth in order to fill up the outlin there wa 
no enorm which the greek wa not today to believ of them the tyrant 
wa the negat of govern and law hi assassin wa gloriou 
there wa no crime howev unnatur which might not with probabl 
be attribut to him in thi plato wa onli follow the common 
thought of hi countryman which he embellish and exagg with all 
the power of hi geniu there is no need to suppo that he drew 
from life or that hi knowledg of tyrant is deriv from a person 
acquaint with dionysiu the manner in which he speak of them would 
rather tend to render doubt hi ever have consort with them or 
entertain the scheme which are attribut to him in the epistl of 
regen sicili by their help 

plato in a hyperbol and serio comic vein exagg the folli of 
democraci which he also see reflect in social life to him democraci 
is a state of individu or dissolut in which everi one is do 
what is right in hi own eye of a peopl anim by a common spirit 
of liberti rise a one man to repel the persian host which is the 
lead idea of democraci in herodotu and thucydid he never seem to 
think but if he is not a believ in liberti still le is he a lover 
of tyranni hi deeper and more seriou condemn is reserv for the 
tyrant who is the ideal of wick and also of weak and who 
in hi utter helpless and suspici is lead an almost 
imposs exist without that remnant of good which in plato s 
opinion wa requir to give power to evil book i thi ideal of 
wick live in helpless miseri is the rever of that other 
portrait of perfect injust rule in happi and splendour which 
first of all thrasymachu and afterward the son of ariston had drawn 
and is also the rever of the king whose rule of life is the good of 
hi subject 

each of these govern and individu ha a correspond 
ethic gradat the ideal state is under the rule of reason not 
extinguish but harmon the passion and train them in virtu 
in the timocraci and the timocrat man the constitut whether of the 
state or of the individu is base first upon courag and secondli 
upon the love of honour thi latter virtu which is hardli to be 
esteem a virtu ha supers all the rest in the second stage of 
declin the virtu have altogeth disappear and the love of gain 
ha succeed to them in the third stage or democraci the variou 
passion are allow to have free play and the virtu and vice are 
imparti cultiv but thi freedom which lead to mani curiou 
extravag of charact is in realiti onli a state of weak and 
dissip at last one monster passion take poss of the whole 
natur of man thi is tyranni in all of them excess the excess first 
of wealth and then of freedom is the element of decay 

the eighth book of the republ abound in pictur of life and fanci 
allu the use of metaphor languag is carri to a greater 
extent than anywh el in plato we may remark 

1 the descript of the two nation in one which becom more and 
more divid in the greek republ a in feudal time and perhap 
also in our own 

2 the notion of democraci express in a sort of pythagorean formula 
a equal among unequ 

3 the free and easi way of men and anim which are characterist 
of liberti a foreign mercenari and univ mistrust are of the 
tyrant 

4 the propo that mere debt should not be recov by law is a 
specul which ha often been entertain by reform of the law 
in modern time and is in harmoni with the tendenc of modern 
legisl debt and land were the two great difficulti of the 
ancient lawgiv in modern time we may be said to have almost if not 
quit solv the first of these difficulti but hardli the second 

still more remark are the correspond portrait of individu 
there is the famili pictur of the father and mother and the old servant 
of the timocrat man and the outward respect and inher 
mean of the oligarch the uncontrol licenc and freedom of 
the democrat in which the young alcibiad seem to be depict do 
right or wrong a he plea and who at last like the prodig 
go into a far countri note here the play of languag by which the 
democrat man is himself repr under the imag of a state have 
a citadel and receiv embassi and there is the wild beast natur 
which break loo in hi successor the hit about the tyrant be a 
parricid the repres of the tyrant s life a an obscen dream 
the rhetor surpri of a more miser than the most miser of 
men in book ix the hint to the poet that if they are the friend of 
tyrant there is no place for them in a constitut state and that 
they are too clever not to see the proprieti of their own expul the 
continu imag of the drone who are of two kind swell at last 
into the monster drone have wing book ix are among plato s 
happiest touch 

there remain to be consid the great difficulti of thi book of the 
republ the so call number of the state thi is a puzzl almost a 
great a the number of the beast in the book of revel and though 
appar known to aristotl is refer to by cicero a a proverb of 
obscur ep ad att and some have imagin that there is no answer 
to the puzzl and that plato ha been practi upon hi reader 
but such a decept a thi is inconsist with the manner in which 
aristotl speak of the number pol and would have been ridicul to 
ani reader of the republ who wa acquaint with greek mathemat 
a littl reason is there for suppo that plato intent use 
obscur express the obscur ari from our want of familiar 
with the subject on the other hand plato himself indic that he is 
not altogeth seriou and in describ hi number a a solemn jest of 
the muse he appear to impli some degr of satir on the symbol 
use of number compar cratylu protag 

our hope of understand the passag depend princip on an accur 
studi of the word themselv on which a faint light is thrown by the 
parallel passag in the ninth book anoth help is the allu in 
aristotl who make the import remark that the latter part of the 
passag greek describ a solid figur pol he onli say that 
noth is abid but that all thing chang in a certain cycl and 
that the origin of the chang is a base of number which are in the 
ratio of 4 3 and thi when combin with a figur of five give two 
harmoni he mean when the number of thi figur becom solid 
some further clue may be gather from the appear of the pythagorean 
triangl which is denot by the number 3 4 5 and in which a in 
everi right angl triangl the squar of the two lesser side equal 
the squar of the hypotenu 9 16 25 

plato begin by speak of a perfect or cyclic number tim i e 
a number in which the sum of the divisor equal the whole thi is the 
divin or perfect number in which all lesser cycl or revolut are 
complet he also speak of a human or imperfect number have four 
term and three interv of number which are relat to one anoth in 
certain proport these he convert into figur and find in 
them when they have been rai to the third power certain element of 
number which give two harmoni the one squar the other oblong 
but he doe not say that the squar number answer to the divin or the 
oblong number to the human cycl nor is ani intim given that the 
first or divin number repr the period of the world the second 
the period of the state or of the human race a zeller suppo nor 
is the divin number afterward mention arist the second is the 
number of gener or birth and presid over them in the same 
mysteri manner in which the star presid over them or in which 
accord to the pythagorean opportun justic marriag are 
repr by some number or figur thi is probabl the number 216 

the explan given in the text suppo the two harmoni to make up 
the number 8000 thi explan deriv a certain plausibl from 
the circumst that 8000 is the ancient number of the spartan citizen 
herod and would be what plato might have call a number which 
nearli concern the popul of a citi the mysteri disappear 
of the spartan popul may possibl have suggest to him the first 
cau of hi declin of state the lesser or squar harmoni of 400 
might be a symbol of the guardian the larger or oblong harmoni 
of the peopl and the number 3 4 5 might refer respect to the 
three order in the state or part of the soul the four virtu the 
five form of govern the harmoni of the music scale which 
is elsewh use a a symbol of the harmoni of the state is also 
indic for the number 3 4 5 which repr the side of the 
pythagorean triangl also denot the interv of the scale 

the term use in the statement of the problem may be explain a 
follow a perfect number greek a alreadi state is one which is 
equal to the sum of it divisor thu 6 which is the first perfect or 
cyclic number 1 2 3 the word greek term or note and 
greek interv are applic to music a well a to number and 
figur greek is the base on which the whole calcul depend 
or the lowest term from which it can be work out the word greek 
have been variou translat squar and cube donaldson 
equal and equal in power weber by involut and 
evolut i e by rai the power and extract the root a in

decrea greek are those which succeed the sum of their divisor

and agreeabl to one anoth greek seem to be differ way of 
describ the same relat with more or le preci they are 
equiv to express in term have the same relat to one 
anoth like the seri 8 12 18 27 each of which number is in the 
relat of 1 and 1 2 to the prece the base or fundament

fourth greek is a proport of number a of music note 
appli either to the part or factor of a singl number or to the 
relat of one number to anoth the first harmoni is a squar 
number greek the second harmoni is an oblong number greek i e a 
number repr a figur of which the opposit side onli are 
equal greek number squar from or upon diamet greek 
ration i e omit fraction greek irrat i e 
includ fraction e g 49 is a squar of the ration diamet of a 
figur the side of which 5 50 of an irrat diamet of the same 
for sever of the explan here given and for a good deal besid 
i am indebt to an excel articl on the platon number by dr 
donaldson proc of the philol societi 

the conclu which he draw from these data are sum up by him a 
follow have assum that the number of the perfect or divin cycl 
is the number of the world and the number of the imperfect cycl the 
number of the state he proce the period of the world is defin 
by the perfect number 6 that of the state by the cube of that number 
or 216 which is the product of the last pair of term in the platon 
tetracti a seri of seven term 1 2 3 4 9 8 27 and if 
we take thi a the basi of our comput we shall have two cube 
number greek viz 8 and 27 and the mean proport between 
these viz 12 and 18 will furnish three interv and four term 
and these term and interv stand relat to one anoth in the 
sesqui altera ratio i e each term is to the prece a 3 2 now if 
we rememb that the number 216 8 x 27 3 cube 4 cube 5 cube 
and 3 squar 4 squar 5 squar we must admit that thi 
number impli the number 3 4 5 to which musician attach so much 
import and if we combin the ratio 4 3 with the number 5 or 
multipli the ratio of the side by the hypotenu we shall by first 
squar and then cube obtain two express which denot the ratio 
of the two last pair of term in the platon tetracti the former 
multipli by the squar the latter by the cube of the number 10 the 
sum of the first four digit which constitut the platon tetracti 
the two greek he elsewh explain a follow the first greek is 
greek in other word 4 3 x 5 all squar 100 x 2 squar over 3 
squar the second greek a cube of the same root is describ 
a 100 multipli alpha by the ration diamet of 5 diminish 
by uniti i e a shown abov 48 beta by two incommensur 
diamet i e the two first irrat or 2 and 3 and gamma by 
the cube of 3 or 27 thu we have 48 5 27 100 1000 x 2 cube 
thi second harmoni is to be the cube of the number of which the former 
harmoni is the squar and therefor must be divid by the cube of 
3 in other word the whole express will be 1 for the first 
harmoni 400 9 2 for the second harmoni 8000 27 

the reason which have inclin me to agr with dr donaldson and also 
with schleiermach in suppo that 216 is the platon number of 
birth are 1 that it coincid with the descript of the number 
given in the first part of the passag greek 2 that the 
number 216 with it permut would have been familiar to a greek 
mathematician though unfamiliar to u 3 that 216 is the cube of 
6 and also the sum of 3 cube 4 cube 5 cube the number 3 4 5 
repr the pythagorean triangl of which the side when squar 
equal the squar of the hypotenu 9 16 25 4 that it is also 
the period of the pythagorean metempsychosi 5 the three ultim 
term or base 3 4 5 of which 216 is compo answer to the third 
fourth fifth in the music scale 6 that the number 216 is the 
product of the cube of 2 and 3 which are the two last term in 
the platon tetracti 7 that the pythagorean triangl is said by 
plutarch de is et osir proclu super prima eucl and quintilian 
de musica to be contain in thi passag so that the tradit 
of the school seem to point in the same direct 8 that the 
pythagorean triangl is call also the figur of marriag greek 

but though agr with dr donaldson thu far i see no reason for 
suppo a he doe that the first or perfect number is the world 
the human or imperfect number the state nor ha he given ani proof that 
the second harmoni is a cube nor do i think that greek can mean 
two incommensur which he arbitrarili assum to be 2 and 3 
but rather a the prece clau impli greek i e two squar 
number base upon irrat diamet of a figur the side of which is 
5 50 x 2 

the greatest object to the translat is the sen given to the 
word greek a base of three with a third ad to it multipli 
by 5 in thi somewhat forc manner plato introduc onc more the 
number of the pythagorean triangl but the coincid in the number 
which follow are in favour of the explan the first harmoni of 400 
a ha been alreadi remark probabl repr the ruler the second 
and oblong harmoni of 7600 the peopl 

and here we take leav of the difficulti the discoveri of the riddl 
would be useless and would throw no light on ancient mathemat the 
point of interest is that plato should have use such a symbol and 
that so much of the pythagorean spirit should have prevail in him hi 
gener mean is that divin creation is perfect and is repr 
or presid over by a perfect or cyclic number human gener is 
imperfect and repr or presid over by an imperfect number or 
seri of number the number 5040 which is the number of the citizen 
in the law is expressli base by him on utilitarian ground name 
the conveni of the number for divi it is also made up of 
the first seven digit multipli by one anoth the contrast of the 
perfect and imperfect number may have been easili suggest by the 
correct of the cycl which were made first by meton and secondli 
by callippu the latter is said to have been a pupil of plato of the 
degr of import or of exact to be attribut to the problem 
the number of the tyrant in book ix 729 365 x 2 and the slight 
correct of the error in the number 5040 12 law may furnish a 
criterion there is noth surpri in the circumst that those 
who were seek for order in natur and had found order in number 
should have imagin one to give law to the other plato belief in 
a power of number far beyond what he could see realiz in the world 
around him and he know the great influenc which the littl matter 
of 1 2 3 exerci upon educ he may even be thought to have a 
prophet anticip of the discoveri of quetelet and other that 
number depend upon number e g in popul the number of birth 
and the respect number of child born of either sex on the 
respect age of parent i e on other number 

book ix last of all come the tyrann man about whom we have to 
enquir whenc is he and how doe he live in happi or in miseri 
there is howev a previou question of the natur and number of 
the appetit which i should like to consid first some of them 
are unlaw and yet admit of be chasten and weaken in variou 
degr by the power of reason and law what appetit do you mean i 
mean those which are awak when the reason power are asleep which 
get up and walk about nake without ani self respect or shame and there 
is no conceiv folli or crime howev cruel or unnatur of which 
in imagin they may not be guilti true he said veri true 
but when a man s pul beat temper and he ha sup on a feast 
of reason and come to a knowledg of himself befor go to rest and 
ha satisfi hi desir just enough to prevent their perturb hi 
reason which remain clear and lumin and when he is free from 
quarrel and heat the vision which he ha on hi bed are least 
irregular and abnorm even in good men there is such an irregular 
wild beast natur which peer out in sleep 

to return you rememb what wa said of the democrat that he wa the 
son of a miserli father who encourag the save desir and repress 
the ornament and expen one present the youth got into fine 
compani and began to entertain a dislik to hi father s narrow way 
and be a better man than the corrupt of hi youth he came to a 
mean and led a life not of lawless or slavish passion but of regular 
and success indulg now imagin that the youth ha becom a 
father and ha a son who is expo to the same temptat and ha 
companion who lead him into everi sort of iniqu and parent and 
friend who tri to keep him right the counsellor of evil find that 
their onli chanc of retain him is to implant in hi soul a monster 
drone or love while other desir buzz around him and mystifi him with 
sweet sound and scent thi monster love take poss of him 
and put an end to everi true or modest thought or wish love like 
drunken and mad is a tyranni and the tyrann man whether 
made by natur or habit is just a drink lust furiou sort of 
anim 

and how doe such an one live nay that you must tell me well then 
i fanci that he will live amid revelri and harlotri and love will 
be the lord and master of the hou mani desir requir much money 
and so he spend all that he ha and borrow more and when he ha 
noth the young raven are still in the nest in which they were 
hatch cri for food love urg them on and they must be gratifi 
by forc or fraud or if not they becom pain and troublesom 
and a the new pleasur succeed the old one so will the son take 
poss of the good of hi parent if they show sign of refu 
he will defraud and deceiv them and if they openli resist what then 
i can onli say that i should not much like to be in their place 
but o heaven adeimantu to think that for some new fangl and 
unnecessari love he will give up hi old father and mother best and 
dearest of friend or enslav them to the fanci of the hour truli a 
tyrann son is a bless to hi father and mother when there is no 
more to be got out of them he turn burglar or pickpocket or rob a 
templ love overmast the thought of hi youth and he becom 
in sober realiti the monster that he wa sometim in sleep he wax 
strong in all violenc and lawless and is readi for ani deed of 
dare that will suppli the want of hi rabbl rout in a well order 
state there are onli a few such and these in time of war go out and 
becom the mercenari of a tyrant but in time of peac they stay 
at home and do mischief they are the thief footpad cut pur 
man stealer of the commun or if they are abl to speak they turn 
fal wit and inform no small catalogu of crime truli 
even if the perpetr are few ye i said but small and great are 
rel term and no crime which are commit by them approach those 
of the tyrant whom thi class grow strong and numer creat out 
of themselv if the peopl yield well and good but if they resist 
then a befor he beat hi father and mother so now he beat hi 
fatherland and motherland and place hi mercenari over them such 
men in their earli day live with flatter and they themselv 
flatter other in order to gain their end but they soon discard their 
follow when they have no longer ani need of them they are alway 
either master or servant the joy of friendship are unknown to them 
and they are utterli treacher and unjust if the natur of justic be 
at all understood by u they realiz our dream and he who is the most 
of a tyrant by natur and lead the life of a tyrant for the longest 
time will be the worst of them and be the worst of them will also 
be the most miser 

like man like state the tyrann man will answer to tyranni which 
is the extrem opposit of the royal state for one is the best and the 
other the worst but which is the happier great and terribl a the 
tyrant may appear enthron amid hi satellit let u not be afraid to 
go in and ask and the answer is that the monarch is the happiest 
and the tyrann the most miser of state and may we not ask the 
same question about the men themselv request some one to look into 
them who is abl to penetr the inner natur of man and will not be 
panic struck by the vain pomp of tyranni i will suppo that he is one 
who ha live with him and ha seen him in famili life or perhap in 
the hour of troubl and danger 

assum that we ourselv are the imparti judg for whom we seek let 
u begin by compar the individu and state and ask first of all 
whether the state is like to be free or enslav will there not be 
a littl freedom and a great deal of slaveri and the freedom is of the 
bad and the slaveri of the good and thi appli to the man a well 
a to the state for hi soul is full of mean and slaveri and the 
better part is enslav to the wor he cannot do what he would and 
hi mind is full of confu he is the veri rever of a freeman the 
state will be poor and full of miseri and sorrow and the man s soul 
will also be poor and full of sorrow and he will be the most miser 
of men no not the most miser for there is yet a more miser 
who is that the tyrann man who ha the misfortun also to becom 
a public tyrant there i suspect that you are right say rather i 
am sure conjectur is out of place in an enquiri of thi natur he 
is like a wealthi owner of slave onli he ha more of them than 
ani privat individu you will say the owner of slave are not 
gener in ani fear of them but whi becau the whole citi is in a 
leagu which protect the individu suppo howev that one of these 
owner and hi household is carri off by a god into a wilder 
where there are no freeman to help him will he not be in an agoni of 
terror will he not be compel to flatter hi slave and to promi 
them mani thing sore against hi will and suppo the same god who 
carri him off were to surround him with neighbour who declar that no 
man ought to have slave and that the owner of them should be punish 
with death still wor and wor he will be in the midst of hi 
enemi and is not our tyrant such a captiv soul who is torment by 
a swarm of passion which he cannot indulg live indoor alway like 
a woman and jealou of those who can go out and see the world 

have so mani evil will not the most miser of men be still more 
miser in a public station master of other when he is not master of 
himself like a sick man who is compel to be an athlet the meanest 
of slave and the most abject of flatter want all thing and 
never abl to satisfi hi desir alway in fear and distract 
like the state of which he is the repr hi jealou 
hate faithless temper grow wor with command he is more and more 
faithless enviou unright the most wretch of men a miseri 
to himself and to other and so let u have a final trial and 
proclam need we hire a herald or shall i proclaim the result 
made the proclam yourself the son of ariston the best is of 
opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest and that 
thi is he who is the most royal master of himself and that the unjust 
man is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of hi state and i 
add further seen or unseen by god or men 

thi is our first proof the second is deriv from the three kind 
of pleasur which answer to the three element of the soul reason 
passion desir under which last is comprehend avar a well a 
sensual appetit while passion includ ambit parti feel love 
of reput reason again is sole direct to the attain of 
truth and careless of money and reput in accord with the 
differ of men s natur one of these three principl is in the 
ascend and they have their sever pleasur correspond to them 
interrog now the three natur and each one will be found prai 
hi own pleasur and depreci those of other the money maker will 
contrast the vaniti of knowledg with the solid advantag of wealth 
the ambiti man will despi knowledg which bring no honour wherea 
the philosoph will regard onli the fruition of truth and will call 
other pleasur necessari rather than good now how shall we decid 
between them is there ani better criterion than experi and 
knowledg and which of the three ha the truest knowledg and the 
widest experi the experi of youth make the philosoph 
acquaint with the two kind of desir but the avarici and the 
ambiti man never tast the pleasur of truth and wisdom honour he 
ha equal with them they are judg of him but he is not judg 
of them for they never attain to the knowledg of true be and hi 
instrument is reason wherea their standard is onli wealth and honour 
and if by reason we are to judg hi good will be the truest and so we 
arriv at the result that the pleasur of the ration part of the soul 
and a life pa in such pleasur is the pleasantest he who ha a 
right to judg judg thu next come the life of ambit and in the 
third place that of money make 

twice ha the just man overthrown the unjust onc more a in an 
olympian contest first offer up a prayer to the saviour zeu let 
him tri a fall a wise man whisper to me that the pleasur of the wise 
are true and pure all other are a shadow onli let u examin thi 
is not pleasur oppo to pain and is there not a mean state which 
is neither when a man is sick noth is more pleasant to him than 
health but thi he never found out while he wa well in pain he 
desir onli to cea from pain on the other hand when he is in an 
ecstasi of pleasur rest is pain to him thu rest or cessat 
is both pleasur and pain but can that which is neither becom both 
again pleasur and pain are motion and the absenc of them is rest 
but if so how can the absenc of either of them be the other thu 
we are led to infer that the contradict is an appear onli and 
witcheri of the sen and these are not the onli pleasur for there 
are other which have no prece pain pure pleasur then is not the 
absenc of pain nor pure pain the absenc of pleasur although most of 
the pleasur which reach the mind through the bodi are relief of 
pain and have not onli their reaction when they depart but their 
anticip befor they come they can be best describ in a simil 
there is in natur an upper lower and middl region and he who pa 
from the lower to the middl imago that he is go up and is alreadi 
in the upper world and if he were taken back again would think 
and truli think that he wa descend all thi ari out of hi 
ignor of the true upper middl and lower region and a like 
confu happen with pleasur and pain and with mani other thing 
the man who compar grey with black call grey white and the man who 
compar absenc of pain with pain call the absenc of pain pleasur 
again hunger and thirst are inanit of the bodi ignor and folli 
of the soul and food is the satisfact of the one knowledg of the 
other now which is the purer satisfact that of eat and drink 
or that of knowledg consid the matter thu the satisfact of 
that which ha more exist is truer than of that which ha le the 
invari and immort ha a more real exist than the variabl 
and mortal and ha a correspond measur of knowledg and truth the 
soul again ha more exist and truth and knowledg than the bodi 
and is therefor more realli satisfi and ha a more natur pleasur 
those who feast onli on earthli food are alway go at random up 
to the middl and down again but they never pa into the true upper 
world or have a tast of true pleasur they are like fat beast 
full of gluttoni and sensual and readi to kill one anoth by reason 
of their insati lust for they are not fill with true be and 
their vessel is leaki gorgia their pleasur are mere shadow of 
pleasur mix with pain colour and intensifi by contrast 
and therefor inten desir and men go fight about them a 
stesichoru say that the greek fought about the shadow of helen at 
troy becau they know not the truth 

the same may be said of the passion element the desir of 
the ambiti soul a well a of the covet have an inferior 
satisfact onli when under the guidanc of reason do either of the 
other principl do their own busi or attain the pleasur which is 
natur to them when not attain they compel the other part of the 
soul to pursu a shadow of pleasur which is not their and the more 
distant they are from philosophi and reason the more distant they will 
be from law and order and the more illu will be their pleasur 
the desir of love and tyranni are the farthest from law and those 
of the king are nearest to it there is one genuin pleasur and two 
spuriou one the tyrant go beyond even the latter he ha run away 
altogeth from law and reason nor can the measur of hi inferior 
be told except in a figur the tyrant is the third remov from the 
oligarch and ha therefor not a shadow of hi pleasur but the 
shadow of a shadow onli the oligarch again is thrice remov from 
the king and thu we get the formula 3 x 3 which is the number of a 
surfac repr the shadow which is the tyrant s pleasur and 
if you like to cube thi number of the beast you will find that the 
measur of the differ amount to 729 the king is 729 time more 
happi than the tyrant and thi extraordinari number is nearli equal 
to the number of day and night in a year 365 x 2 730 and is 
therefor concern with human life thi is the interv between a good 
and bad man in happi onli what must be the differ between them 
in come of life and virtu 

perhap you may rememb some one say at the begin of our 
discu that the unjust man wa profit if he had the reput of 
justic now that we know the natur of justic and injust let u 
make an imag of the soul which will personifi hi word first of all 
fashion a multitudin beast have a ring of head of all manner of 
anim tame and wild and abl to produc and chang them at pleasur 
suppo now anoth form of a lion and anoth of a man the second 
smaller than the first the third than the second join them togeth 
and cover them with a human skin in which they are complet 
conceal when thi ha been done let u tell the support of 
injust that he is feed up the beast and starv the man the 
maintain of justic on the other hand is tri to strengthen the 
man he is nourish the gentl principl within him and make an 
allianc with the lion heart in order that he may be abl to keep down 
the mani head hydra and bring all into uniti with each other and 
with themselv thu in everi point of view whether in relat to 
pleasur honour or advantag the just man is right and the unjust 
wrong 

but now let u reason with the unjust who is not intent in 
error is not the nobl that which subject the beast to the man or 
rather to the god in man the ignobl that which subject the man to 
the beast and if so who would receiv gold on condit that he wa to 
degrad the noblest part of himself under the worst who would sell hi 
son or daughter into the hand of brutal and evil men for ani amount 
of money and will he sell hi own fairer and divin part without ani 
compunct to the most godless and foul would he not be wor than 
eriphyl who sold her husband s life for a necklac and intemp 
is the let loo of the multiform monster and pride and sullen 
are the growth and increa of the lion and serpent element while 
luxuri and effeminaci are cau by a too great relax of spirit 
flatteri and mean again ari when the spirit element is subject 
to avar and the lion is habitu to becom a monkey the real 
disgrac of handicraft art is that those who are engag in them have 
to flatter instead of master their desir therefor we say that 
they should be place under the control of the better principl in 
anoth becau they have none in themselv not a thrasymachu 
imagin to the injuri of the subject but for their good and our 
intent in educ the young is to give them self control the 
law desir to nur up in them a higher principl and when they have 
acquir thi they may go their way 

what then shall a man profit if he gain the whole world and becom 
more and more wick or what shall he profit by escap discoveri if 
the conceal of evil prevent the cure if he had been punish 
the brute within him would have been silenc and the gentler element 
liber and he would have unit temper justic and wisdom in 
hi soul a union better far than ani combin of bodili gift the 
man of understand will honour knowledg abov all in the next 
place he will keep under hi bodi not onli for the sake of health and 
strength but in order to attain the most perfect harmoni of bodi 
and soul in the acquisit of rich too he will aim at order and 
harmoni he will not desir to heap up wealth without measur but he 
will fear that the increa of wealth will disturb the constitut of 
hi own soul for the same reason he will onli accept such honour a 
will make him a better man ani other he will declin in that case 
said he he will never be a politician ye but he will in hi own 
citi though probabl not in hi nativ countri unless by some divin 
accid you mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal citi which 
ha no place upon earth but in heaven i repli there is a pattern 
of such a citi and he who wish may order hi life after that imag 
whether such a state is or ever will be matter not he will act 
accord to that pattern and no other 

the most notic point in the 9th book of the republ are 1 the 
account of pleasur 2 the number of the interv which divid the 
king from the tyrant 3 the pattern which is in heaven 

1 plato s account of pleasur is remark for moder and in 
thi respect contrast with the later platonist and the view which are 
attribut to them by aristotl he is not like the cynic oppo 
to all pleasur but rather desir that the sever part of the 
soul shall have their natur satisfact he even agr with the 
epicurean in describ pleasur a someth more than the absenc of 
pain thi is prove by the circumst that there are pleasur which 
have no antec pain a he also remark in the philebu such a 
the pleasur of smell and also the pleasur of hope and anticip 
in the previou book he had made the distinct between necessari 
and unnecessari pleasur which is repeat by aristotl and he now 
observ that there are a further class of wild beast pleasur 
correspond to aristotl s greek he dwell upon the rel and 
unreal charact of sensual pleasur and the illu which ari out 
of the contrast of pleasur and pain point out the superior of 
the pleasur of reason which are at rest over the fleet pleasur 
of sen and emot the pre emin of royal pleasur is shown by 
the fact that reason is abl to form a judgment of the lower pleasur 
while the two lower part of the soul are incap of judg the 
pleasur of reason thu in hi treatment of pleasur a in mani 
other subject the philosophi of plato is sawn up into quantiti by 
aristotl the analysi which wa origin made by him becam in the 
next gener the foundat of further technic distinct both 
in plato and aristotl we note the illu under which the ancient 
fell of regard the transienc of pleasur a a proof of it 
unreal and of confound the perman of the intellectu 
pleasur with the unchang of the knowledg from which they are 
deriv neither do we like to admit that the pleasur of knowledg 
though more elev are not more last than other pleasur 
and are almost equal depend on the accid of our bodili state 
introduct to philebu 

2 the number of the interv which separ the king from the tyrant 
and royal from tyrann pleasur is 729 the cube of 9 which plato 
characterist design a a number concern with human life 
becau nearli equiv to the number of day and night in the 
year he is desir of proclaim that the interv between them is 
immeasur and invent a formula to give express to hi idea 
those who spoke of justic a a cube of virtu a an art of measur 
prot saw no inappropri in conceiv the soul under the 
figur of a line or the pleasur of the tyrant a separ from the 
pleasur of the king by the numer interv of 729 and in modern 
time we sometim use metaphor what plato employ a a 
philosoph formula it is not easi to estim the loss of the 
tyrant except perhap in thi way say plato so we might say that 
although the life of a good man is not to be compar to that of a bad 
man yet you may measur the differ between them by valu one 
minut of the one at an hour of the other one day in thi court is 
better than a thousand or you might say that there is an infinit 
differ but thi is not so much a say in home phrase they 
are a thousand mile asund and accordingli plato find the natur 
vehicl of hi thought in a progress of number thi arithmet 
formula he draw out with the utmost seriou and both here and in 
the number of gener seem to find an addit proof of the truth 
of hi specul in form the number into a geometr figur just 
a person in our own day are apt to fanci that a statement is verifi 
when it ha been onli thrown into an abstract form in speak of the 
number 729 a proper to human life he probabl intend to intim 
that one year of the tyrann 12 hour of the royal life 

the simpl observ that the comparison of two similar solid 
is effect by the comparison of the cube of their side is the 
mathemat groundwork of thi fanci express there is some 
difficulti in explain the step by which the number 729 is obtain 
the oligarch is remov in the third degr from the royal and 
aristocrat and the tyrant in the third degr from the 
oligarch but we have to arrang the term a the side of a squar 
and to count the oligarch twice over thu reckon them not a 5 but 
a 9 the squar of 9 is pa lightli over a onli a step toward 
the cube 

3 toward the close of the republ plato seem to be more and more 
convinc of the ideal charact of hi own specul at the end of 
the 9th book the pattern which is in heaven take the place of the 
citi of philosoph on earth the vision which ha receiv form and 
substanc at hi hand is now discov to be at a distanc and yet 
thi distant kingdom is also the rule of man s life say not lo here 
or lo there for the kingdom of god is within you thu a note 
is struck which prepar for the revel of a futur life in the 
follow book but the futur life is present still the ideal of 
polit is to be realiz in the individu 

book x mani thing plea me in the order of our state but there 
wa noth which i like better than the regul about poetri the 
divi of the soul throw a new light on our exclu of imit 
i do not mind tell you in confid that all poetri is an outrag on 
the understand unless the hearer have that balm of knowledg which 
heal error i have love homer ever sinc i wa a boy and even now 
he appear to me to be the great master of tragic poetri but much a 
i love the man i love truth more and therefor i must speak out and 
first of all will you explain what is imit for realli i do not 
understand how like then that i should understand that might veri 
well be for the duller often see better than the keener eye true 
but in your presenc i can hardli ventur to say what i think 
then suppo that we begin in our old fashion with the doctrin of 
univ let u assum the exist of bed and tabl there is one 
idea of a bed or of a tabl which the maker of each had in hi mind 
when make them he did not make the idea of bed and tabl but he 
made bed and tabl accord to the idea and is there not a maker 
of the work of all workman who make not onli vessel but plant and 
anim himself the earth and heaven and thing in heaven and under 
the earth he make the god also he must be a wizard ind but do 
you not see that there is a sen in which you could do the same you 
have onli to take a mirror and catch the reflect of the sun and the 
earth or anyth el there now you have made them ye but onli 
in appear exactli so and the painter is such a creator a you are 
with the mirror and he is even more unreal than the carpent although 
neither the carpent nor ani other artist can be suppo to make the 
absolut bed not if philosoph may be believ nor need we wonder 
that hi bed ha but an imperfect relat to the truth reflect here 
are three bed one in natur which is made by god anoth which is 
made by the carpent and the third by the painter god onli made one 
nor could he have made more than one for if there had been two there 
would alway have been a third more absolut and abstract than either 
under which they would have been includ we may therefor conceiv god 
to be the natur maker of the bed and in a lower sen the carpent 
is also the maker but the painter is rather the imit of what the 
other two make he ha to do with a creation which is thrice remov 
from realiti and the tragic poet is an imit and like everi 
other imit is thrice remov from the king and from the truth 
the painter imit not the origin bed but the bed made by the 
carpent and thi without be realli differ appear to be 
differ and ha mani point of view of which onli one is caught by 
the painter who repr everyth becau he repr a piec of 
everyth and that piec an imag and he can paint ani other artist 
although he know noth of their art and thi with suffici skill 
to deceiv child or simpl peopl suppo now that somebodi came to 
u and told u how he had met a man who knew all that everybodi know 
and better than anybodi should we not infer him to be a simpleton who 
have no discern of truth and falsehood had met with a wizard 
or enchant whom he fanci to be all wise and when we hear person 
say that homer and the tragedian know all the art and all the 
virtu must we not infer that they are under a similar delu they 
do not see that the poet are imit and that their creation are 
onli imit veri true but if a person could creat a well a 
imit he would rather leav some perman work and not an imit 
onli he would rather be the receiv than the giver of prai ye 
for then he would have more honour and advantag 

let u now interrog homer and the poet friend homer say i to him 
i am not go to ask you about medicin or ani art to which your 
poem incid refer but about their main subject war militari 
tactic polit if you are onli twice and not thrice remov from the 
truth not an imit or an imag maker plea to inform u what good 
you have ever done to mankind is there ani citi which profess to have 
receiv law from you a sicili and itali have from charonda sparta 
from lycurgu athen from solon or wa ani war ever carri on by your 
counsel or is ani invent attribut to you a there is to thale 
and anacharsi or is there ani homer way of life such a the 
pythagorean wa in which you instruct men and which is call after 
you no ind and creophylu flesh child wa even more unfortun 
in hi breed than he wa in hi name if a tradit say homer in 
hi lifetim wa allow by him and hi other friend to starv ye 
but could thi ever have happen if homer had realli been the educ 
of hella would he not have had mani devot follow if protagora 
and prodicu can persuad their contemporari that no one can manag 
hou or state without them is it like that homer and hesiod would 
have been allow to go about a beggar i mean if they had realli been 
abl to do the world ani good would not men have compel them 
to stay where they were or have follow them about in order to get 
educ but they did not and therefor we may infer that homer and 
all the poet are onli imit who do but imit the appear of 
thing for a a painter by a knowledg of figur and colour can paint a 
cobbler without ani practic in cobbl so the poet can delin 
ani art in the colour of languag and give harmoni and rhythm to the 
cobbler and also to the gener and you know how mere narrat when 
depriv of the ornament of metr is like a face which ha lost the 
beauti of youth and never had ani other onc more the imit ha no 
knowledg of realiti but onli of appear the painter paint and 
the artif make a bridl and rein but neither understand the use 
of them the knowledg of thi is confin to the horseman and so of 
other thing thu we have three art one of use anoth of invent 
a third of imit and the user furnish the rule to the two other 
the flute player will know the good and bad flute and the maker 
will put faith in him but the imit will neither know nor have 
faith neither scienc nor true opinion can be ascrib to him 
imit then is devoid of knowledg be onli a kind of play 
or sport and the tragic and epic poet are imit in the highest 
degr 

and now let u enquir what is the faculti in man which answer to 
imit allow me to explain my mean object are differ seen 
when in the water and when out of the water when near and when at a 
distanc and the painter or juggler make use of thi variat to 
impo upon u and the art of measur and weigh and calcul 
come in to save our bewild mind from the power of appear for 
a we were say two contrari opinion of the same about the same and 
at the same time cannot both of them be true but which of them is 
true is determin by the art of calcul and thi is alli to the 
better faculti in the soul a the art of imit are to the wor 
and the same hold of the ear a well a of the eye of poetri a well 
a paint the imit is of action voluntari or involuntari 
in which there is an expect of a good or bad result and present 
experi of pleasur and pain but is a man in harmoni with himself 
when he is the subject of these conflict influenc is there not 
rather a contradict in him let me further ask whether he is more 
like to control sorrow when he is alon or when he is in compani 
in the latter case feel would lead him to indulg hi sorrow but 
reason and law control him and enjoin patienc sinc he cannot know 
whether hi afflict is good or evil and no human thing is of 
ani great consequ while sorrow is certainli a hindranc to good 
counsel for when we stumbl we should not like child make an 
uproar we should take the measur which reason prescrib not rai 
a lament but find a cure and the better part of u is readi to 
follow reason while the irrat principl is full of sorrow and 
distract at the recollect of our troubl unfortun howev 
thi latter furnish the chief materi of the imit art wherea 
reason is ever in repo and cannot easili be display especi to a 
mix multitud who have no experi of her thu the poet is like the 
painter in two way first he paint an inferior degr of truth and 
secondli he is concern with an inferior part of the soul he indulg 
the feel while he enfeebl the reason and we refu to allow him 
to have author over the mind of man for he ha no measur of greater 
and le and is a maker of imag and veri far gone from truth 

but we have not yet mention the heaviest count in the indict the 
power which poetri ha of injuri excit the feel when we 
hear some passag in which a hero lament hi suffer at tediou 
length you know that we sympath with him and prai the poet and 
yet in our own sorrow such an exhibit of feel is regard a 
effemin and unmanli ion now ought a man to feel pleasur in 
see anoth do what he hate and abomin in himself is he not 
give way to a sentiment which in hi own case he would control he is 
off hi guard becau the sorrow is anoth s and he think that he 
may indulg hi feel without disgrac and will be the gainer by 
the pleasur but the inevit consequ is that he who begin by 
weep at the sorrow of other will end by weep at hi own the 
same is true of comedi you may often laugh at buffooneri which you 
would be asham to utter and the love of coar merriment on the stage 
will at last turn you into a buffoon at home poetri feed and water 
the passion and desir she let them rule instead of rule them and 
therefor when we hear the encomiast of homer affirm that he is 
the educ of hella and that all life should be regul by hi 
precept we may allow the excel of their intent and agr 
with them in think homer a great poet and tragedian but we shall 
continu to prohibit all poetri which go beyond hymn to the god and 
prai of famou men not pleasur and pain but law and reason shall 
rule in our state 

these are our ground for expel poetri but lest she should charg 
u with discourtesi let u also make an apolog to her we will remind 
her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetri and philosophi of 
which there are mani trace in the write of the poet such a the 
say of the she dog yelp at her mistress and the philosoph 
who are readi to circumv zeu and the philosoph who are 
pauper nevertheless we bear her no ill will and will gladli allow 
her to return upon condit that she make a defenc of herself in 
ver and her support who are not poet may speak in prose we 
confess her charm but if she cannot show that she is use a well 
a delight like ration lover we must renounc our love 
though endear to u by earli associ have come to year of 
discret we know that poetri is not truth and that a man should be 
care how he introduc her to that state or constitut which he 
himself is for there is a mighti issu at stake no le than the good 
or evil of a human soul and it is not worth while to forsak justic 
and virtu for the attract of poetri ani more than for the sake of 
honour or wealth i agr with you 

and yet the reward of virtu are greater far than i have describ 
and can we conceiv thing greater still not perhap in thi brief 
span of life but should an immort be care about anyth short of 
etern i do not understand what you mean do you not know that the 
soul is immort sure you are not prepar to prove that ind i 
am then let me hear thi argument of which you make so light 

you would admit that everyth ha an element of good and of evil in 
all thing there is an inher corrupt and if thi cannot destroy 
them noth el will the soul too ha her own corrupt principl 
which are injust intemp coward and the like but none of 
these destroy the soul in the same sen that disea destroy the bodi 
the soul may be full of all iniqu but is not by reason of them 
brought ani nearer to death noth which wa not destroy from within 
ever perish by extern affect of evil the bodi which is one 
thing cannot be destroy by food which is anoth unless the bad 
of the food is commun to the bodi neither can the soul which 
is one thing be corrupt by the bodi which is anoth unless she 
herself is infect and a no bodili evil can infect the soul neither 
can ani bodili evil whether disea or violenc or ani other destroy 
the soul unless it can be shown to render her unholi and unjust but no 
one will ever prove that the soul of men becom more unjust when 
they die if a person ha the audac to say the contrari the answer 
is then whi do crimin requir the hand of the execut and 
not die of themselv truli he said injust would not be veri 
terribl if it brought a cessat of evil but i rather believ that 
the injust which murder other may tend to quicken and stimul 
the life of the unjust you are quit right if sin which is her own 
natur and inher evil cannot destroy the soul hardli will anyth 
el destroy her but the soul which cannot be destroy either by 
intern or extern evil must be immort and everlast and if 
thi be true soul will alway exist in the same number they cannot 
diminish becau they cannot be destroy nor yet increa for the 
increa of the immort must come from someth mortal and so all 
would end in immort neither is the soul variabl and diver for 
that which is immort must be of the fairest and simplest composit 
if we would conceiv her truli and so behold justic and injust in 
their own natur she must be view by the light of reason pure a at 
birth or a she is reflect in philosophi when hold conver with 
the divin and immort and etern in her present condit we see her 
onli like the sea god glaucu brui and maim in the sea which is 
the world and cover with shell and stone which are incrust upon 
her from the entertain of earth 

thu far a the argument requir we have said noth of the reward 
and honour which the poet attribut to justic we have content 
ourselv with show that justic in herself is best for the soul in 
herself even if a man should put on a gyge ring and have the helmet 
of hade too and now you shall repay me what you borrow and i will 
enum the reward of justic in life and after death i grant 
for the sake of argument a you will rememb that evil might 
perhap escap the knowledg of god and men although thi wa realli 
imposs and sinc i have shown that justic ha realiti you must 
grant me also that she ha the palm of appear in the first place 
the just man is known to the god and he is therefor the friend of the 
god and he will receiv at their hand everi good alway except 
such evil a is the necessari consequ of former sin all thing end 
in good to him either in life or after death even what appear to 
be evil for the god have a care of him who desir to be in their 
like and what shall we say of men is not honesti the best polici 
the clever rogu make a great start at first but break down befor he 
reach the goal and slink away in dishonour wherea the true runner 
persev to the end and receiv the prize and you must allow me 
to repeat all the bless which you attribut to the fortun 
unjust they bear rule in the citi they marri and give in marriag to 
whom they will and the evil which you attribut to the unfortun 
just do realli fall in the end on the unjust although a you impli 
their suffer are better veil in silenc 

but all the bless of thi present life are a noth when compar 
with those which await good men after death i should like to hear 
about them come then and i will tell you the stori of er the son of 
armeniu a valiant man he wa suppo to have die in battl but ten 
day afterward hi bodi wa found untouch by corrupt and sent home 
for burial on the twelfth day he wa place on the funer pyre and 
there he came to life again and told what he had seen in the world 
below he said that hi soul went with a great compani to a place in 
which there were two chasm near togeth in the earth beneath and two 
correspond chasm in the heaven abov and there were judg sit 
in the intermedi space bid the just ascend by the heavenli 
way on the right hand have the seal of their judgment set upon them 
befor while the unjust have the seal behind were bidden to descend 
by the way on the left hand him they told to look and listen a he wa 
to be their messeng to men from the world below and he beheld and saw 
the soul depart after judgment at either chasm some who came from 
earth were worn and travel stain other who came from heaven 
were clean and bright they seem glad to meet and rest awhil in the 
meadow here they discour with one anoth of what they had seen in 
the other world those who came from earth wept at the remembr of 
their sorrow but the spirit from abov spoke of gloriou sight and 
heavenli bliss he said that for everi evil deed they were punish 
tenfold now the journey wa of a thousand year durat becau the 
life of man wa reckon a a hundr year and the reward of virtu 
were in the same proport he ad someth hardli worth repeat 
about infant die almost a soon a they were born of parricid and 
other murder he had tortur still more terribl to narrat he wa 
present when one of the spirit ask where is ardiaeu the great 
thi ardiaeu wa a cruel tyrant who had murder hi father and hi 
elder brother a thousand year befor anoth spirit answer 
he come not hither and will never come and i myself he ad 
actual saw thi terribl sight at the entranc of the chasm a we 
were about to reascend ardiaeu appear and some other sinner most 
of whom had been tyrant but not all and just a they fanci that 
they were return to life the chasm gave a roar and then wild 
fieri look men who knew the mean of the sound seiz him and 
sever other and bound them hand and foot and threw them down and 
drag them along at the side of the road lacer them and card 
them like wool and explain to the passer by that they were go 
to be cast into hell the greatest terror of the pilgrim ascend wa 
lest they should hear the voic and when there wa silenc one by one 
they pa up with joy to these suffer there were correspond 
delight 

on the eighth day the soul of the pilgrim resum their journey 
and in four day came to a spot whenc they look down upon a line of 
light in colour like a rainbow onli brighter and clearer one day 
more brought them to the place and they saw that thi wa the column 
of light which bind togeth the whole univ the end of the column 
were fasten to heaven and from them hung the distaff of necess 
on which all the heavenli bodi turn the hook and spindl were of 
adam and the whorl of a mix substanc the whorl wa in form

lachesi in turn put forth her hand from time to time to guid both 
of them on their arriv the pilgrim went to lachesi and there wa 
an interpret who arrang them and take from her knee lot and 
sampl of life got up into a pulpit and said mortal soul hear 
the word of lachesi the daughter of necess a new period of 
mortal life ha begun and you may choo what divin you plea 
the respon of choo is with you god is blameless after 
speak thu he cast the lot among them and each one took up the 
lot which fell near him he then place on the ground befor them the 
sampl of life mani more than the soul present and there were all 
sort of life of men and of anim there were tyranni end in 
miseri and exil and life of men and woman famou for their differ 
qualiti and also mix life made up of wealth and poverti 
sick and health here glaucon is the great risk of human life and 
therefor the whole of educ should be direct to the acquisit 
of such a knowledg a will teach a man to refu the evil and choo 
the good he should know all the combin which occur in life of 
beauti with poverti or with wealth of knowledg with extern 
good and at last choo with refer to the natur of the soul 
regard that onli a the better life which make men better and 
leav the rest and a man must take with him an iron sen of truth 
and right into the world below that there too he may remain undazzl 
by wealth or the allur of evil and be determin to avoid the 
extrem and choo the mean for thi a the messeng report the 
interpret to have said is the true happi of man and ani one a 
he proclaim may if he choo with understand have a good lot 
even though he come last let not the first be careless in hi choic 
nor the last despair he spoke and when he had spoken he who had 
drawn the first lot chose a tyranni he did not see that he wa fate to 
devour hi own child and when he discov hi mistak he wept 
and beat hi breast blame chanc and the god and anybodi rather 
than himself he wa one of those who had come from heaven and in hi 
previou life had been a citizen of a well order state but he had 
onli habit and no philosophi like mani anoth he made a bad choic 
becau he had no experi of life wherea those who came from earth 
and had seen troubl were not in such a hurri to choo but if a 
man had follow philosophi while upon earth and had been moder 
fortun in hi lot he might not onli be happi here but hi 
pilgrimag both from and to thi world would be smooth and heavenli 
noth wa more curiou than the spectacl of the choic at onc sad 
and laughabl and wonder most of the soul onli seek to avoid 
their own condit in a previou life he saw the soul of orpheu 
chang into a swan becau he would not be born of a woman there wa 
thamyra becom a nighting music bird like the swan choo 
to be men the twentieth soul which wa that of ajax prefer the 
life of a lion to that of a man in remembr of the injust which 
wa done to him in the judgment of the arm and agamemnon from a like 
enmiti to human natur pa into an eagl about the middl wa the 
soul of atalanta choo the honour of an athlet and next to her 
epeu take the natur of a workwoman among the last wa thersit 
who wa chang himself into a monkey thither the last of all came 
odysseu and sought the lot of a privat man which lay neglect and 
despi and when he found it he went away rejoic and said that if 
he had been first instead of last hi choic would have been the same 
men too were seen pa into anim and wild and tame anim 
chang into one anoth 

when all the soul had chosen they went to lachesi who sent with each 
of them their geniu or attend to fulfil their lot he first of 
all brought them under the hand of clotho and drew them within the 
revolut of the spindl impel by her hand from her they were 
carri to atropo who made the thread irrev whenc without 
turn round they pa beneath the throne of necess and when 
they had all pa they move on in scorch heat to the plain of 
forget and rest at even by the river unmind whose water 
could not be retain in ani vessel of thi they had all to drink a 
certain quantiti some of them drank more than wa requir and he who 
drank forgot all thing er himself wa prevent from drink

thu glaucon the tale ha been save and will be our salvat if we 
believ that the soul is immort and hold fast to the heavenli way 
of justic and knowledg so shall we pa undefil over the river 
of forget and be dear to ourselv and to the god and have 
a crown of reward and happi both in thi world and also in the 
millenni pilgrimag of the other 

the tenth book of the republ of plato fall into two divi first 
resum an old thread which ha been interrupt socrat assail the 
poet who now that the natur of the soul ha been analyz are 
seen to be veri far gone from the truth and secondli have shown the 
realiti of the happi of the just he demand that appear shall 
be restor to him and then proce to prove the immort of the 
soul the argument a in the phaedo and gorgia is supplement by the 
vision of a futur life 

whi plato who wa himself a poet and whose dialogu are poem and 
drama should have been hostil to the poet a a class and especi 
to the dramat poet whi he should not have seen that truth may 
be embodi in ver a well a in prose and that there are some 
indefin light and shadow of human life which can onli be express 
in poetri some element of imagin which alway entwin with 
reason whi he should have suppo epic ver to be insepar 
associ with the impur of the old hellen mytholog whi 
he should tri homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of 
util are question which have alway been debat amongst student 
of plato though unabl to give a complet answer to them we may 
show first that hi view aro natur out of the circumst 
of hi age and secondli we may elicit the truth a well a the error 
which is contain in them 

he is the enemi of the poet becau poetri wa declin in hi own 
lifetim and a theatrocraci a he say in the law had taken the 
place of an intellectu aristocraci euripid exhibit the last phase 
of the tragic drama and in him plato saw the friend and apologist of 
tyrant and the sophist of tragedi the old comedi wa almost extinct 
the new had not yet arisen dramat and lyric poetri like everi other 
branch of greek literatur wa fall under the power of rhetor 
there wa no second or third to aeschylu and sophocl in the 
gener which follow them aristophan in one of hi later 
comedi frog speak of thousand of tragedi make prattler 
whose attempt at poetri he compar to the chirp of swallow their 
garrul went far beyond euripid they appear onc upon the 
stage and there wa an end of them to a man of geniu who had a 
real appreci of the godlik aeschylu and the nobl and gentl 
sophocl though disagr with some part of their theolog 
rep these minor poet must have been contempt and intol 
there is no feel stronger in the dialogu of plato than a sen of 
the declin and decay both in literatur and in polit which mark 
hi own age nor can he have been expect to look with favour on the 
licenc of aristophan now at the end of hi career who had begun by 
satir socrat in the cloud and in a similar spirit forti year 
afterward had satir the founder of ideal commonwealth in hi 
eccleziazusa or femal parliament law 

there were other reason for the antagon of plato to poetri the 
profess of an actor wa regard by him a a degrad of human 
natur for one man in hi life cannot play mani part the 
charact which the actor perform seem to destroy hi own charact 
and to leav noth which can be truli call himself neither can ani 
man live hi life and act it the actor is the slave of hi art not the 
master of it take thi view plato is more decid in hi expul of 
the dramat than of the epic poet though he must have known that 
the greek tragedian afford nobl lesson and exampl of virtu 
and patriot to which noth in homer can be compar but great 
dramat or even great rhetor power is hardli consist with 
firm or strength of mind and dramat talent is often incid 
associ with a weak or dissolut charact 

in the tenth book plato introduc a new seri of object first 
he say that the poet or painter is an imit and in the third 
degr remov from the truth hi creation are not test by rule and 
measur they are onli appear in modern time we should say that 
art is not mere imit but rather the express of the ideal in 
form of sen even adopt the humbl imag of plato from which 
hi argument deriv a colour we should maintain that the artist may 
ennobl the bed which he paint by the fold of the draperi or by the 
feel of home which he introduc and there have been modern 
painter who have impart such an ideal interest to a blacksmith s or 
a carpent s shop the eye or mind which feel a well a see can give 
digniti and patho to a ruin mill or a straw built shed rembrandt 
to the hull of a vessel go to it last home turner still more 
would thi appli to the greatest work of art which seem to be the 
visibl embodi of the divin had plato been ask whether the zeu 
or athen of pheidia wa the imit of an imit onli would he 
not have been compel to admit that someth more wa to be found in 
them than in the form of ani mortal and that the rule of proport 
to which they conform wa higher far than ani geometri or arithmet 
could express statesman 

again plato object to the imit art that they express the 
emot rather than the ration part of human natur he doe not 
admit aristotl s theori that tragedi or other seriou imit are 
a purgat of the passion by piti and fear to him they appear onli to 
afford the opportun of indulg them yet we must acknowledg that 
we may sometim cure disord emot by give express to them 
and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own breast 
it is not everi indulg of the feel which is to be condemn 
for there may be a gratif of the higher a well a of the 
lower thought which are too deep or too sad to be express by 
ourselv may find an utter in the word of poet everi one would 
acknowledg that there have been time when they were consol and 
elev by beauti music or by the sublim of architectur or by 
the peac of natur plato ha himself admit in the earlier 
part of the republ that the art might have the effect of harmon 
a well a of enerv the mind but in the tenth book he regard them 
through a stoic or puritan medium he ask onli what good have they 
done and is not satisfi with the repli that they have given 
innoc pleasur to mankind 

he tell u that he rejoic in the banish of the poet sinc he 
ha found by the analysi of the soul that they are concern with the 
inferior faculti he mean to say that the higher faculti have to do 
with univ the lower with particular of sen the poet are on 
a level with their own age but not on a level with socrat and plato 
and he wa well awar that homer and hesiod could not be made a rule of 
life by ani process of legitim interpret hi iron use of 
them is in fact a denial of their author he saw too that the 
poet were not critic a he say in the apolog ani one wa a better 
interpret of their write than they were themselv he himself 
cea to be a poet when he becam a discipl of socrat though a he 
tell u of solon he might have been one of the greatest of them if 
he had not been deter by other pursuit tim thu from mani point 
of view there is an antagon between plato and the poet which wa 
foreshadow to him in the old quarrel between philosophi and poetri 
the poet a he say in the protagora were the sophist of their day 
and hi dislik of the one class is reflect on the other he regard 
them both a the enemi of reason and abstract though in the 
case of euripid more with refer to hi immor sentiment about 
tyrant and the like for plato is the prophet who came into the world 
to convinc men first of the fallibl of sen and opinion and 
secondli of the realiti of abstract idea whatev strang there 
may be in modern time in oppo philosophi to poetri which to u 
seem to have so mani element in common the strang will disappear 
if we conceiv of poetri a alli to sen and of philosophi a 
equiv to thought and abstract unfortun the veri word 
idea which to plato is express of the most real of all thing is 
associ in our mind with an element of subject and unreal 
we may note also how he differ from aristotl who declar poetri to 
be truer than histori for the opposit reason becau it is concern 
with univ not like histori with particular poet 

the thing which are seen are oppo in scriptur to the thing which 
are unseen they are equal oppo in plato to univ and idea 
to him all particular appear to be float about in a world of sen 
they have a taint of error or even of evil there is no difficulti in 
see that thi is an illu for there is no more error or variat 
in an individu man hor bed etc than in the class man hor 
bed etc nor is the truth which is display in individu instanc 
le certain than that which is convey through the medium of 
idea but plato who is deepli impress with the real import of 
univ a instrument of thought attribut to them an essenti 
truth which is imaginari and unreal for univ may be often fal 
and particular true had he attain to ani clear concept of the 
individu which is the synthesi of the univ and the particular 
or had he been abl to distinguish between opinion and sensat which 
the ambigu of the word greek and the like tend to confu he 
would not have deni truth to the particular of sen 

but the poet are also the repr of falsehood and feign 
in all depart of life and knowledg like the sophist and 
rhetorician of the gorgia and phaedru they are the fal priest 
fal prophet lie spirit enchant of the world there is anoth 
count put into the indict against them by plato that they are 
the friend of the tyrant and bask in the sunshin of hi patronag 
despot in all age ha had an apparatu of fal idea and fal 
teacher at it servic in the histori of modern europ a well a of 
greec and rome for no govern of men depend sole upon forc 
without some corrupt of literatur and moral some appeal to the 
imagin of the mass some pretenc to the favour of heaven some 
element of good give power to evil tyranni even for a short time 
cannot be maintain the greek tyrant were not insen to the 
import of awaken in their cau a pseudo hellen feel they 
were proud of success at the olymp game they were not devoid of 
the love of literatur and art plato is think in the first instanc 
of greek poet who had grace the court of dionysiu or archelau and 
the old spirit of freedom is rou within him at their prostitut of 
the tragic muse in the prai of tyranni but hi prophet eye extend 
beyond them to the fal teacher of other age who are the creatur of 
the govern under which they live he compar the corrupt of hi 
contemporari with the idea of a perfect societi and gather up 
into one mass of evil the evil and error of mankind to him they are 
personifi in the rhetorician sophist poet ruler who deceiv and 
govern the world 

a further object which plato make to poetri and the imit 
art is that they excit the emot here the modern reader will be 
dispo to introduc a distinct which appear to have escap him 
for the emot are neither bad nor good in themselv and are not 
most like to be control by the attempt to erad them but by 
the moder indulg of them and the vocat of art is to present 
thought in the form of feel to enlist the feel on the side of 
reason to inspir even for a moment courag or resign perhap to 
suggest a sen of infin and etern in a way which mere languag is 
incap of attain true the same power which in the purer age of 
art embodi god and hero onli may be made to express the voluptu 
imag of a corinthian courtezan but thi onli show that art like 
other outward thing may be turn to good and also to evil and is not 
more close connect with the higher than with the lower part of the 
soul all imit art is subject to certain limit and therefor 
necessarili partak of the natur of a compromi someth of ideal 
truth is sacrif for the sake of the repres and someth in 
the exact of the repres is sacrif to the ideal still 
work of art have a perman element they ideal and detain the 
pa thought and are the intermedi between sen and idea 

in the present stage of the human mind poetri and other form of 
fiction may certainli be regard a a good but we can also imagin the 
exist of an age in which a sever concept of truth ha either 
banish or transform them at ani rate we must admit that they hold 
a differ place at differ period of the world s histori in the 
infanc of mankind poetri with the except of proverb is the 
whole of literatur and the onli instrument of intellectu cultur in 
modern time she is the shadow or echo of her former self and appear 
to have a precari exist milton in hi day doubt whether an 
epic poem wa ani longer possibl at the same time we must rememb 
that what plato would have call the charm of poetri have been partli 
transfer to prose he himself statesman admit rhetor to be the 
handmaiden of polit and propo to find in the strain of law law 
a substitut for the old poet among ourselv the creativ power seem 
often to be grow weaker and scientif fact to be more engross 
and overpow to the mind than formerli the illu of the feel 
commonli call love ha hitherto been the inspir influenc of 
modern poetri and romanc and ha exerci a human if not a 
strengthen influenc on the world but may not the stimulu which 
love ha given to fanci be some day exhaust the modern english novel 
which is the most popular of all form of read is not more than a 
centuri or two old will the tale of love a hundr year henc after 
so mani thousand variat of the same theme be still receiv with 
unab interest 

art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophi or religion and may 
often corrupt them it is possibl to conceiv a mental state in which 
all artist repres are regard a a fal and imperfect 
express either of the religi ideal or of the philosoph ideal 
the fairest form may be revolt in certain mood of mind a is 
prove by the fact that the mahometan and mani sect of christian 
have renounc the use of pictur and imag the begin of a great 
religion whether christian or gentil ha not been wood or stone 
but a spirit move in the heart of men the discipl have met in a 
larg upper room or in hole and cave of the earth in the second or 
third gener they have had mosqu templ church monasteri 
and the reviv or reform of religion like the first revel 
of them ha come from within and ha gener disregard extern 
ceremoni and accompani 

but poetri and art may also be the express of the highest truth and 
the purest sentiment plato himself seem to waver between two opposit 
view when a in the third book he insist that youth should be 
brought up amid wholesom imageri and again in book x when he banish 
the poet from hi republ admit that the art which some of u 
almost deifi have fallen short of their higher aim we must admit on 
the other hand that to banish imagin wholli would be suicid a 
well a imposs for natur too is a form of art and a breath of 
the fresh air or a singl glanc at the vari landscap would in an 
instant reviv and reillumin the extinguish spark of poetri in the 
human breast in the lower stage of civil imagin more than 
reason distinguish man from the anim and to banish art would be 
to banish thought to banish languag to banish the express of 
all truth no religion is wholli devoid of extern form even the 
mahometan who renounc the use of pictur and imag ha a templ in 
which he worship the most high a solemn and beauti a ani greek or 
christian build feel too and thought are not realli oppo for 
he who think must feel befor he can execut and the highest thought 
when they becom familiar to u are alway tend to pa into the 
form of feel 

plato doe not seriou intend to expel poet from life and societi 
but he feel strongli the unreal of their write he is protest 
against the degeneraci of poetri in hi own day a we might protest 
against the want of seriou purpo in modern fiction against the 
unseemli or extravag of some of our poet or novelist 
against the time serv of preacher or public writer against the 
regardless of truth which to the eye of the philosoph seem to 
charact the greater part of the world for we too have reason to 
complain that our poet and novelist paint inferior truth and are 
concern with the inferior part of the soul that the reader of them 
becom what they read and are injuri affect by them and we look 
in vain for that healthi atmosph of which plato speak the beauti 
which meet the sen like a breez and impercept draw the soul 
even in childhood into harmoni with the beauti of reason 

for there might be a poetri which would be the hymn of divin 
perfect the harmoni of good and truth among men a strain which 
should renew the youth of the world and bring back the age in which 
the poet wa man s onli teacher and best friend which would find 
materi in the live present a well a in the romanc of the 
past and might subdu to the fairest form of speech and ver the 
intract materi of modern civili which might elicit the 
simpl principl or a plato would have call them the essenti 
form of truth and justic out of the varieti of opinion and the 
complex of modern societi which would preserv all the good of each 
gener and leav the bad unsung which should be base not on vain 
long or faint imagin but on a clear insight into the natur of 
man then the tale of love might begin again in poetri or prose two in 
one unit in the pursuit of knowledg or the servic of god and man 
and feel of love might still be the incent to great thought 
and heroic deed a in the day of dant or petrarch and mani type 
of manli and womanli beauti might appear among u rise abov the 
ordinari level of human and mani life which were like poem law 
be not onli written but live by u a few such strain have been 
heard among men in the tragedi of aeschylu and sophocl whom plato 
quot not a homer is quot by him in ironi but with deep and 
seriou approv in the poetri of milton and wordsworth and in 
passag of other english poet first and abov all in the hebrew 
prophet and psalmist shakespear ha taught u how great men should 
speak and act he ha drawn charact of a wonder puriti and depth 
he ha ennobl the human mind but like homer rep he ha left 
no way of life the next greatest poet of modern time goeth is 
concern with a lower degr of truth he paint the world a a stage 
on which all the men and woman are mere player he cultiv life 
a an art but he furnish no ideal of truth and action the poet may 
rebel against ani attempt to set limit to hi fanci and he may 
argu truli that moral in ver is not poetri possibl like 
mephistophel in faust he may retali on hi adversari but the 
philosoph will still be justifi in ask how may the heavenli 
gift of poesi be devot to the good of mankind 

return to plato we may observ that a similar mixtur of truth 
and error appear in other part of the argument he is awar of the 
absurd of mankind frame their whole life accord to homer just 
a in the phaedru he intim the absurd of interpret mytholog 
upon ration principl both these were the modern tendenc of hi 
own age which he deservedli ridicul on the other hand hi argument 
that homer if he had been abl to teach mankind anyth worth know 
would not have been allow by them to go about beg a a rhapsodist 
is both fal and contrari to the spirit of plato rep it may be 
compar with those other paradox of the gorgia that no statesman 
wa ever unjustli put to death by the citi of which he wa the head 
and that no sophist wa ever defraud by hi pupil gorg 

the argument for immort seem to rest on the absolut dualism of 
soul and bodi admit the exist of the soul we know of no forc 
which is abl to put an end to her vice is her own proper evil and if 
she cannot be destroy by that she cannot be destroy by ani other 
yet plato ha acknowledg that the soul may be so overgrown by the 
incrust of earth a to lose her origin form and in the timaeu 
he recogn more strongli than in the republ the influenc which the 
bodi ha over the mind deni even the voluntari of human action 
on the ground that they proceed from physic state tim in the 
republ a elsewh he waver between the origin soul which ha 
to be restor and the charact which is develop by train and 
educ 

the vision of anoth world is ascrib to er the son of armeniu who 
is said by clement of alexandria to have been zoroast the tale 
ha certainli an orient charact and may be compar with the 
pilgrimag of the soul in the zend avesta haug avesta but no trace 
of acquaint with zoroast is found elsewh in plato s write 
and there is no reason for give him the name of er the pamphylian the 
philosophi of heracleitu cannot be shown to be borrow from zoroast 
and still le the myth of plato 

the local arrang of the vision is le distinct than that of the 
phaedru and phaedo astronomi is mingl with symbol and mytholog 
the great sphere of heaven is repr under the symbol of a cylind 
or box contain the seven orbit of the planet and the fix star 
thi is suspend from an axi or spindl which turn on the knee of 
necess the revolut of the seven orbit contain in the cylind 
are guid by the fate and their harmoni motion produc the music 
of the sphere through the innermost or eighth of these which is the 
moon is pa the spindl but it is doubt whether thi is the 
continu of the column of light from which the pilgrim contempl 
the heaven the word of plato impli that they are connect but 
not the same the column itself is clearli not of adam the spindl 
which is of adam is fasten to the end of the chain which 
extend to the middl of the column of light thi column is said to hold 
togeth the heaven but whether it hang from the spindl or is at 
right angl to it is not explain the cylind contain the orbit 
of the star is almost a much a symbol a the figur of necess 
turn the spindl for the outermost rim is the sphere of the fix 
star and noth is said about the interv of space which divid the 
path of the star in the heaven the descript is both a pictur and 
an orreri and therefor is necessarili inconsist with itself the 
column of light is not the milki way which is neither straight nor 
like a rainbow but the imaginari axi of the earth thi is compar 
to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour and not to the 
undergird of a trirem but to the straight rope run from prow to 
stern in which the undergird meet 

the orreri or pictur of the heaven given in the republ differ in 
it mode of repres from the circl of the same and of the 
other in the timaeu in both the fix star are distinguish from the 
planet and they move in orbit without them although in an opposit 
direct in the republ a in the timaeu they are all move round 
the axi of the world but we are not certain that in the former they 
are move round the earth no distinct mention is made in the republ 
of the circl of the same and other although both in the timaeu and 
in the republ the motion of the fix star is suppo to coincid 
with the motion of the whole the rel thick of the rim is 
perhap design to express the rel distanc of the planet 
plato probabl intend to repr the earth from which er and hi 
companion are view the heaven a stationari in place but whether 
or not herself revolv unless thi is impli in the revolut of 
the axi is uncertain timaeu the spectat may be suppo to look 
at the heavenli bodi either from abov or below the earth is a sort 
of earth and heaven in one like the heaven of the phaedru on the back 
of which the spectat go out to take a peep at the star and is born 
round in the revolut there is no distinct between the equat and 
the eclipt but plato is no doubt led to imagin that the planet have 
an opposit motion to that of the fix star in order to account for 
their appear in the heaven in the descript of the meadow and 
the retribut of the good and evil after death there are trace of 
homer 

the descript of the axi a a spindl and of the heavenli bodi a 
form a whole partli ari out of the attempt to connect the motion 
of the heavenli bodi with the mytholog imag of the web or 
weav of the fate the give of the lot the weav of them 
and the make of them irrev which are ascrib to the three 
fate lachesi clotho atropo are obviou deriv from their 
name the element of chanc in human life is indic by the order of 
the lot but chanc howev adver may be overcom by the wisdom 
of man if he know how to choo aright there is a wor enemi to man 
than chanc thi enemi is himself he who wa moder fortun in 
the number of the lot even the veri last comer might have a good life 
if he chose with wisdom and a plato doe not like to make an assert 
which is unproven he more than confirm thi statement a few sentenc 
afterward by the exampl of odysseu who chose last but the virtu 
which is found on habit is not suffici to enabl a man to choo 
he must add to virtu knowledg if he is to act rightli when place 
in new circumst the routin of good action and good habit is 
an inferior sort of good and a coleridg say common sen 
is intol which is not base on metaphi so plato would have 
said habit is worthless which is not base upon philosophi 

the freedom of the will to refu the evil and to choo the good is 
distinctli assert virtu is free and a a man honour or dishonour 
her he will have more or le of her the life of man is round

pol but within the wall of necess there is an open space in 
which he is hi own master and can studi for himself the effect which 
the variou compound gift of natur or fortun have upon the soul

there still remain to be consid some point which have been 
intent reserv to the end 1 the janu like charact of the 
republ which present two face one an hellen state the other a 
kingdom of philosoph connect with the latter of the two aspect 
are 2 the paradox of the republ a they have been term by 
morgenstern a the commun of properti b of famili c the 
rule of philosoph d the analog of the individu and the state 
which like some other analog in the republ is carri too far we 
may then proceed to consid 3 the subject of educ a conceiv 
by plato bring togeth in a gener view the educ of youth 
and the educ of after life 4 we may note further some essenti 
differ between ancient and modern polit which are suggest by 
the republ 5 we may compar the politicu and the law 6 we may 
observ the influenc exerci by plato on hi imit and 7 
take occa to consid the natur and valu of polit and 8 of 
religi ideal 

1 plato expressli say that he is intend to found an hellen state 
book v mani of hi regul are characterist spartan such 
a the prohibit of gold and silver the common meal of the men the 
militari train of the youth the gymnast exerci of the woman 
the life of sparta wa the life of a camp law enforc even more 
rigidli in time of peac than in war the citizen of sparta like 
plato s were forbidden to trade they were to be soldier and not 
shopkeep nowher el in greec wa the individu so complet 
subject to the state the time when he wa to marri the educ of 
hi child the cloth which he wa to wear the food which he wa 
to eat were all prescrib by law some of the best enact in the 
republ such a the rever to be paid to parent and elder 
and some of the worst such a the exposur of deform child are 
borrow from the practic of sparta the encourag of friendship 
between men and youth or of men with one anoth a afford 
incent to braveri is also spartan in sparta too a nearer approach 
wa made than in ani other greek state to equal of the sex and 
to commun of properti and while there wa probabl le of 
licenti in the sen of immor the tie of marriag wa 
regard more lightli than in the rest of greec the suprema lex 
wa the preserv of the famili and the interest of the state the 
coar strength of a militari govern wa not favour to puriti 
and refin and the excess strict of some regul seem 
to have produc a reaction of all hellen the spartan were most 
access to briberi sever of the greatest of them might be 
describ in the word of plato a have a fierc secret long 
after gold and silver though not in the strict sen communist the 
principl of commun wa maintain among them in their divi of 
land in their common meal in their slave and in the free use of 
one anoth s good marriag wa a public institut and the woman 
were educ by the state and sang and danc in public with the men 

mani tradit were preserv at sparta of the sever with which the 
magistr had maintain the primit rule of music and poetri a in 
the republ of plato the new fangl poet wa to be expel hymn 
to the god which are the onli kind of music admit into the ideal 
state were the onli kind which wa permit at sparta the spartan 
though an unpoet race were nevertheless lover of poetri they had 
been stir by the elegiac strain of tyrtaeu they had crowd around 
hippia to hear hi recit of homer but in thi they resembl the 
citizen of the timocrat rather than of the ideal state the council 
of elder men also correspond to the spartan gerousia and the freedom 
with which they are permit to judg about matter of detail agr 
with what we are told of that institut onc more the militari rule 
of not spoil the dead or offer arm at the templ the moder 
in the pursuit of enemi the import attach to the physic 
well be of the citizen the use of warfar for the sake of defenc 
rather than of aggress are featur probabl suggest by the spirit 
and practic of sparta 

to the spartan type the ideal state revert in the first declin and 
the charact of the individu timocrat is borrow from the spartan 
citizen the love of lacedaemon not onli affect plato and xenophon 
but wa share by mani undistinguish athenian there they seem to 
find a principl which wa want in their own democraci the greek 
of the spartan attract them that is to say not the good 
of their law but the spirit of order and loyalti which prevail 
fascin by the idea citizen of athen would imit the 
lacedaemonian in their dress and manner they were known to the 
contemporari of plato a the person who had their ear brui 
like the roundhead of the commonwealth the love of anoth church 
or countri when seen at a distanc onli the long for an imaginari 
simplic in civil time the fond desir of a past which never ha 
been or of a futur which never will be these are aspir of the 
human mind which are often felt among ourselv such feel meet with 
a respon in the republ of plato 

but there are other featur of the platon republ a for exampl 
the literari and philosoph educ and the grace and beauti 
of life which are the rever of spartan plato wish to give hi 
citizen a tast of athenian freedom a well a of lacedaemonian 
disciplin hi individu geniu is pure athenian although in theori 
he is a lover of sparta and he is someth more than either he ha 
also a true hellen feel he is desir of human the war of 
hellen against one anoth he acknowledg that the delphian god is 
the grand hereditari interpret of all hella the spirit of harmoni 
and the dorian mode are to prevail and the whole state is to have an 
extern beauti which is the reflex of the harmoni within but he 
ha not yet found out the truth which he afterward enunci in the 
law that he wa a better legisl who made men to be of one mind 
than he who train them for war the citizen a in other hellen 
state democrat a well a aristocrat are realli an upper class 
for although no mention is made of slave the lower class are 
allow to fade away into the distanc and are repr in the 
individu by the passion plato ha no idea either of a social state 
in which all class are harmon or of a feder of hella or 
the world in which differ nation or state have a place hi citi 
is equip for war rather than for peac and thi would seem to be 
justifi by the ordinari condit of hellen state the myth of the 
earth born men is an embodi of the orthodox tradit of hella 
and the allu to the four age of the world is also sanction by 
the author of hesiod and the poet thu we see that the republ is 
partli found on the ideal of the old greek poli partli on the actual 
circumst of hella in that age plato like the old painter 
retain the tradit form and like them he ha also a vision of a 
citi in the cloud 

there is yet anoth thread which is interwoven in the textur of the 
work for the republ is not onli a dorian state but a pythagorean 
leagu the way of life which wa connect with the name of 
pythagora like the cathol monast order show the power which 
the mind of an individu might exerci over hi contemporari and 
may have natur suggest to plato the possibl of reviv such 
mediaev institut the pythagorean like plato enforc a rule 
of life and a moral and intellectu train the influenc ascrib to 
music which to u seem exagg is also a pythagorean featur it 
is not to be regard a repr the real influenc of music in 
the greek world more nearli than ani other govern of hella the 
pythagorean leagu of three hundr wa an aristocraci of virtu for 
onc in the histori of mankind the philosophi of order or greek 
express and consequ enlist on it side the combin 
endeavour of the better part of the peopl obtain the manag of 
public affair and held poss of it for a consid time until 
about b c 500 probabl onli in state prepar by dorian institut 
would such a leagu have been possibl the ruler like plato s 
greek were requir to submit to a sever train in order to 
prepar the way for the educ of the other member of the commun 
long after the dissolut of the order emin pythagorean such a 
archyta of tarentum retain their polit influenc over the citi 
of magna graecia there wa much here that wa suggest to the kindr 
spirit of plato who had doubtless medit deepli on the way of life 
of pythagora rep and hi follow slight trace of pythagorean 
are to be found in the mystic number of the state in the number which 
express the interv between the king and the tyrant in the doctrin 
of transmigr in the music of the sphere a well a in the great 
though secondari import ascrib to mathemat in educ 

but a in hi philosophi so also in the form of hi state he go far 
beyond the old pythagorean he attempt a task realli imposs which 
is to unit the past of greek histori with the futur of philosophi 
analog to that other imposs which ha often been the dream 
of christendom the attempt to unit the past histori of europ with 
the kingdom of christ noth actual exist in the world at all 
resembl plato s ideal state nor doe he himself imagin that such 
a state is possibl thi he repeat again and again e g in the 
republ or in the law where cast a glanc back on the republ 
he admit that the perfect state of commun and philosophi wa 
imposs in hi own age though still to be retain a a pattern 
the same doubt is impli in the earnest with which he argu in the 
republ that ideal are none the wor becau they cannot be realiz 
in fact and in the choru of laughter which like a break wave will 
a he anticip greet the mention of hi propo though like 
other writer of fiction he u all hi art to give realiti to hi 
invent when ask how the ideal politi can come into be he 
answer iron when one son of a king becom a philosoph he 
design the fiction of the earth born men a a nobl lie and when 
the structur is final complet he fairli tell you that hi republ 
is a vision onli which in some sen may have realiti but not in the 
vulgar one of a reign of philosoph upon earth it ha been said that 
plato fli a well a walk but thi fall short of the truth for he 
fli and walk at the same time and is in the air and on firm ground 
in success instant 

niebuhr ha ask a trifl question which may be briefli notic in 
thi place wa plato a good citizen if by thi is meant wa he loyal 
to athenian institut he can hardli be said to be the friend of 
democraci but neither is he the friend of ani other exist form of 
govern all of them he regard a state of faction law none 
attain to hi ideal of a voluntari rule over voluntari subject which 
seem ind more nearli to describ democraci than ani other and the 
worst of them is tyranni the truth is that the question ha hardli ani 
mean when appli to a great philosoph whose write are not meant 
for a particular age and countri but for all time and all mankind the 
declin of athenian polit wa probabl the motiv which led plato to 
frame an ideal state and the republ may be regard a reflect the 
depart glori of hella a well might we complain of st augustin 
whose great work the citi of god origin in a similar motiv for 
not be loyal to the roman empir even a nearer parallel might be 
afford by the first christian who cannot fairli be charg with 
be bad citizen becau though subject to the higher power they 
were look forward to a citi which is in heaven 

2 the idea of the perfect state is full of paradox when judg of 
accord to the ordinari notion of mankind the paradox of one age 
have been said to becom the commonplac of the next but the 
paradox of plato are at least a paradox to u a they were to hi 
contemporari the modern world ha either sneer at them a absurd 
or denounc them a unnatur and immor men have been plea to 
find in aristotl s critic of them the anticip of their own 
good sen the wealthi and cultiv class have dislik and also 
dread them they have point with satisfact to the failur of 
effort to realiz them in practic yet sinc they are the thought of 
one of the greatest of human intellig and of one who had done 
most to elev moral and religion they seem to deserv a better 
treatment at our hand we may have to address the public a plato doe 
poetri and assur them that we mean no harm to exist institut 
there are seriou error which have a side of truth and which therefor 
may fairli demand a care consid there are truth mix with 
error of which we may ind say the half is better than the whole 
yet the half may be an import contribut to the studi of human 
natur 

a the first paradox is the commun of good which is mention 
slightli at the end of the third book and seemingli a aristotl 
observ is confin to the guardian at least no mention is made of 
the other class but the omiss is not of ani real signif and 
probabl ari out of the plan of the work which prevent the writer 
from enter into detail 

aristotl censur the commun of properti much in the spirit of 
modern polit economi a tend to repress industri and a do 
away with the spirit of benevol modern writer almost refu to 
consid the subject which is suppo to have been long ago settl 
by the common opinion of mankind but it must be rememb that the 
sacr of properti is a notion far more fix in modern than 
in ancient time the world ha grown older and is therefor more 
conserv primit societi offer mani exampl of land held in 
common either by a tribe or by a township and such may probabl 
have been the origin form of land tenur ancient legisl had 
invent variou mode of divid and preserv the divi of land 
among the citizen accord to aristotl there were nation who held 
the land in common and divid the produc and there were other who 
divid the land and store the produc in common the evil of debt and 
the inequ of properti were far greater in ancient than in modern 
time and the accid to which properti wa subject from war or 
revolut or taxat or other legisl interf were also 
greater all these circumst gave properti a le fix and sacr 
charact the earli christian are believ to have held their properti 
in common and the principl is sanction by the word of christ 
himself and ha been maintain a a counsel of perfect in almost 
all age of the church nor have there been want instanc of modern 
enthusiast who have made a religion of commun in everi age of 
religi excit notion like wycliff s inherit of grace 
have tend to prevail a like spirit but fiercer and more violent 
ha appear in polit the prepar of the gospel of peac soon 
becom the red flag of republican 

we can hardli judg what effect plato s view would have upon hi 
own contemporari they would perhap have seem to them onli an 
exagg of the spartan commonwealth even modern writer would 
acknowledg that the right of privat properti is base on expedi 
and may be interf with in a varieti of way for the public good ani 
other mode of vest properti which wa found to be more advantag 
would in time acquir the same basi of right the most use in 
plato s word would be the most sacr the lawyer and ecclesiast 
of former age would have spoken of properti a a sacr institut 
but they onli meant by such languag to oppo the greatest amount 
of resist to ani inva of the right of individu and of the 
church 

when we consid the question without ani fear of immedi applic 
to practic in the spirit of plato s republ are we quit sure that 
the receiv notion of properti are the best is the distribut of 
wealth which is customari in civil countri the most favour 
that can be conceiv for the educ and develop of the mass 
of mankind can the spectat of all time and all exist be quit 
convinc that one or two thousand year henc great chang will not 
have taken place in the right of properti or even that the veri notion 
of properti beyond what is necessari for person mainten may not 
have disappear thi wa a distinct familiar to aristotl though 
like to be laugh at among ourselv such a chang would not be 
greater than some other chang through which the world ha pa 
in the transit from ancient to modern societi for exampl the 
emancip of the serf in russia or the abolit of slaveri in 
america and the west indi and not so great a the differ which 
separ the eastern villag commun from the western world to 
accomplish such a revolut in the cour of a few centuri would 
impli a rate of progress not more rapid than ha actual taken place 
dure the last fifti or sixti year the kingdom of japan underw 
more chang in five or six year than europ in five or six hundr 
mani opinion and belief which have been cherish among ourselv 
quit a strongli a the sacr of properti have pa away and 
the most unten proposit respect the right of bequest or 
entail have been maintain with a much fervour a the most moder 
some one will be heard to ask whether a state of societi can be final in 
which the interest of thousand are peril on the life or charact 
of a singl person and mani will indulg the hope that our present 
condit may after all be onli transit and may conduct to a 
higher in which properti besid minist to the enjoy of the 
few may also furnish the mean of the highest cultur to all and will 
be a greater benefit to the public gener and also more under the 
control of public author there may come a time when the say 
have i not a right to do what i will with my own will appear to be a 
barbar relic of individu when the poss of a part may be 
a greater bless to each and all than the poss of the whole is 
now to ani one 

such reflect appear visionari to the eye of the practic statesman 
but they are within the rang of possibl to the philosoph he can 
imagin that in some distant age or clime and through the influenc of 
some individu the notion of common properti may or might have sunk 
a deep into the heart of a race and have becom a fix to them a 
privat properti is to ourselv he know that thi latter institut 
is not more than four or five thousand year old may not the end revert 
to the begin in our own age even utopia affect the spirit of 
legisl and an abstract idea may exerci a great influenc on 
practic polit 

the object that would be gener urg against plato s commun 
of properti are the old one of aristotl that motif for exert 
would be taken away and that disput would ari when each wa 
depend upon all everi man would produc a littl and consum a 
much a he like the experi of civil nation ha hitherto been 
adver to social the effort is too great for human natur men tri 
to live in common but the person feel is alway break in on 
the other hand it may be doubt whether our present notion of properti 
are not convent for they differ in differ countri and in 
differ state of societi we boast of an individu which is not 
freedom but rather an artifici result of the industri state 
of modern europ the individu is nomin free but he is also 
powerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chain of econom 
necess even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to becom 
disinterest at ani rate we observ in them a power of organ 
which fifti year ago would never have been suspect the same forc 
which have revolut the polit system of europ may effect a 
similar chang in the social and industri relat of mankind and if 
we suppo the influenc of some good a well a neutral motif work 
in the commun there will be no absurd in expect that the 
mass of mankind have power and becom enlighten about the higher 
possibl of human life when they learn how much more is attain 
for all than is at present the poss of a favour few may pursu 
the common interest with an intellig and persist which mankind 
have hitherto never seen 

now that the world ha onc been set in motion and is no longer held 
fast under the tyranni of custom and ignor now that critic ha 
pierc the veil of tradit and the past no longer overpow the 
present the progress of civil may be expect to be far greater 
and swifter than heretofor even at our present rate of speed the point 
at which we may arriv in two or three gener is beyond the power 
of imagin to fores there are forc in the world which work not 
in an arithmet but in a geometr ratio of increa 
educ to use the express of plato move like a wheel with 
an ever multipli rapid nor can we say how great may be it 
influenc when it becom univ when it ha been inherit by 
mani gener when it is freed from the trammel of superstit 
and rightli adapt to the want and capac of differ class 
of men and woman neither do we know how much more the co oper of 
mind or of hand may be capabl of accomplish whether in labour or 
in studi the resourc of the natur scienc are not half develop 
a yet the soil of the earth instead of grow more barren may 
becom mani time more fertil than hitherto the u of machineri far 
greater and also more minut than at present new secret of physiolog 
may be reveal deepli affect human natur in it innermost 
recess the standard of health may be rai and the life of men 
prolong by sanitari and medic knowledg there may be peac there 
may be leisur there may be innoc refresh of mani kind the 
ever increa power of locomot may join the extrem of earth 
there may be mysteri work of the human mind such a occur onli 
at great crisi of histori the east and the west may meet togeth and 
all nation may contribut their thought and their experi to the 
common stock of human mani other element enter into a specul 
of thi kind but it is better to make an end of them for such 
reflect appear to the major far fetch and to men of scienc 
commonplac 

b neither to the mind of plato nor of aristotl did the doctrin of 
commun of properti present at all the same difficulti or appear to 
be the same violat of the common hellen sentiment a the commun 
of wife and child thi paradox he prefac by anoth propo 
that the occup of men and woman shall be the same and that to 
thi end they shall have a common train and educ male and 
femal anim have the same pursuit whi not also the two sex of 
man 

but have we not here fallen into a contradict for we were say 
that differ natur should have differ pursuit how then can men 
and woman have the same and is not the propo inconsist with our 
notion of the divi of labour these object are no sooner rai 
than answer for accord to plato there is no organ differ 
between men and woman but onli the accid one that men beget and 
woman bear child follow the analog of the other anim he 
contend that all natur gift are scatter about indiff among 
both sex though there may be a superior of degr on the part of 
the men the object on the score of decenc to their take part 
in the same gymnast exerci is met by plato s assert that the 
exist feel is a matter of habit 

that plato should have emancip himself from the idea of hi own 
countri and from the exampl of the east show a wonder independ 
of mind he is consciou that woman are half the human race in some 
respect the more import half law and for the sake both of men 
and woman he desir to rai the woman to a higher level of exist 
he bring not sentiment but philosophi to bear upon a question which 
both in ancient and modern time ha been chiefli regard in the light 
of custom or feel the greek had nobl concept of womanhood 
in the goddess athen and artemi and in the heroin antigon and 
andromach but these ideal had no counterpart in actual life the 
athenian woman wa in no way the equal of her husband she wa not the 
entertain of hi guest or the mistress of hi hou but onli hi 
housekeep and the mother of hi child she took no part in militari 
or polit matter nor is there ani instanc in the later age of 
greec of a woman becom famou in literatur her is the greatest 
glori who ha the least renown among men is the historian s concept 
of feminin excel a veri differ ideal of womanhood is held up 
by plato to the world she is to be the companion of the man and to 
share with him in the toil of war and in the care of govern she 
is to be similarli train both in bodili and mental exerci she 
is to lose a far a possibl the incid of matern and the 
characterist of the femal sex 

the modern antagonist of the equal of the sex would argu that the 
differ between men and woman are not confin to the singl point 
urg by plato that sensibl gentl grace are the qualiti 
of woman while energi strength higher intellig are to be look 
for in men and the critic is just the differ affect the whole 
natur and are not a plato suppo confin to a singl point but 
neither can we say how far these differ are due to educ and 
the opinion of mankind or physic inherit from the habit and 
opinion of former gener woman have been alway taught not 
exactli that they are slave but that they are in an inferior posit 
which is also suppo to have compen advantag and to thi 
posit they have conform it is also true that the physic form may 
easili chang in the cour of gener through the mode of life and 
the weak or delicaci which wa onc a matter of opinion may becom 
a physic fact the characterist of sex vari greatli in differ 
countri and rank of societi and at differ age in the same 
individu plato may have been right in deni that there wa ani 
ultim differ in the sex of man other than that which exist in 
anim becau all other differ may be conceiv to disappear in 
other state of societi or under differ circumst of life and 
train 

the first wave have been pa we proceed to the second commun 
of wife and child is it possibl is it desir for a glaucon 
intim and a we far more strongli insist great doubt may 
be entertain about both these point ani free discu of the 
question is imposs and mankind are perhap right in not allow 
the ultim base of social life to be examin few of u can safe 
enquir into the thing which natur hide ani more than we can 
dissect our own bodi still the manner in which plato arriv at hi 
conclu should be consid for here a mr grote ha remark 
is a wonder thing that one of the wisest and best of men should have 
entertain idea of moral which are wholli at varianc with our 
own and if we would do plato justic we must examin care the 
charact of hi propo first we may observ that the relat of 
the sex suppo by him are the rever of licenti he seem rather 
to aim at an imposs strict secondli he conceiv the famili 
to be the natur enemi of the state and he entertain the seriou 
hope that an univ brotherhood may take the place of privat 
interest an aspir which although not justifi by experi 
ha poss mani nobl mind on the other hand there is no sentiment 
or imagin in the connect which men and woman are suppo by 
him to form human be return to the level of the anim neither 
exalt to heaven nor yet abu the natur instinct all that 
world of poetri and fanci which the passion of love ha call forth 
in modern literatur and romanc would have been banish by plato the 
arrang of marriag in the republ are direct to one object the 
improv of the race in success gener a great develop 
both of bodili and mental qualiti might be possibl the analog of 
anim tend to show that mankind can within certain limit receiv a 
chang of natur and a in anim we should commonli choo the best 
for breed and destroy the other so there must be a select made 
of the human be whose life are worthi to be preserv 

we start back horrifi from thi platon ideal in the belief first 
that the higher feel of human are far too strong to be crush 
out secondli that if the plan could be carri into execut we 
should be poorli recompen by improv in the breed for the loss 
of the best thing in life the greatest regard for the weakest and 
meanest of human be the infant the crimin the insan the 
idiot truli seem to u one of the noblest result of christian we 
have learn though a yet imperfectli that the individu man ha an 
endless valu in the sight of god and that we honour him when we honour 
the darken and disfigur imag of him law thi is the lesson 
which christ taught in a parabl when he said their angel do alway 
behold the face of my father which is in heaven such lesson are onli 
partial realiz in ani age they were foreign to the age of plato a 
they have veri differ degr of strength in differ countri or 
age of the christian world to the greek the famili wa a religi and 
customari institut bind the member togeth by a tie inferior 
in strength to that of friendship and have a le solemn and sacr 
sound than that of countri the relationship which exist on the lower 
level of custom plato imagin that he wa rai to the higher level 
of natur and reason while from the modern and christian point of view 
we regard him a sanction murder and destroy the first principl 
of moral 

the great error in these and similar specul is that the differ 
between man and the anim is forgotten in them the human be 
is regard with the eye of a dog or bird fancier or at best of a 
slave owner the higher or human qualiti are left out the breeder 
of anim aim chiefli at size or speed or strength in a few case at 
courag or temper most often the fit of the anim for food is the 
great desideratum but mankind are not bred to be eaten nor yet for 
their superior in fight or in run or in draw cart neither 
doe the improv of the human race consist mere in the increa 
of the bone and flesh but in the growth and enlighten of the mind 
henc there must be a marriag of true mind a well a of bodi of 
imagin and reason a well a of lust and instinct men and woman 
without feel or imagin are justli call brute yet plato 
take away these qualiti and put noth in their place not even 
the desir of a nobl offspr sinc parent are not to know their own 
child the most import transact of social life he who is the 
idealist philosoph convert into the most brutal for the pair are to 
have no relat to one anoth except at the hymen festiv their 
child are not their but the state s nor is ani tie of affect to 
unit them yet here the analog of the anim might have save 
plato from a gigant error if he had not lost sight of hi own 
illustr for the nobler sort of bird and beast nourish and 
protect their offspr and are faith to one anoth 

an emin physiologist think it worth while to tri and place life 
on a physic basi but should not life rest on the moral rather than 
upon the physic the higher come first then the lower first the 
human and ration afterward the anim yet they are not absolut 
divid and in time of sick or moment of self indulg they 
seem to be onli differ aspect of a common human natur which 
includ them both neither is the moral the limit of the physic 
but the expan and enlarg of it the highest form which the 
physic is capabl of receiv a plato would say the bodi doe not 
take care of the bodi and still le of the mind but the mind take 
care of both in all human action not that which is common to man and 
the anim is the characterist element but that which distinguish 
him from them even if we admit the physic basi and resolv all 
virtu into health of bodi la facon que notr sang circul still on 
mere physic ground we must come back to idea mind and reason and 
duti and conscienc under these or other name are alway reappear 
there cannot be health of bodi without health of mind nor health of 
mind without the sen of duti and the love of truth charm 

that the greatest of ancient philosoph should in hi regul 
about marriag have fallen into the error of separ bodi and mind 
doe ind appear surpri yet the wonder is not so much that plato 
should have entertain idea of moral which to our own age are 
revolt but that he should have contradict himself to an extent 
which is hardli credibl fall in an instant from the heaven of 
ideal into the crudest anim rejoic in the newli found gift 
of reflect he appear to have thought out a subject about which he 
had better have follow the enlighten feel of hi own age the 
gener sentiment of hella wa oppo to hi monstrou fanci the old 
poet and in later time the tragedian show no want of respect for 
the famili on which much of their religion wa base but the exampl 
of sparta and perhap in some degr the tendenc to defi public 
opinion seem to have misl him he will make one famili out of all 
the famili of the state he will select the finest specimen of men 
and woman and breed from these onli 

yet becau the illu is alway return for the anim part of 
human natur will from time to time assert itself in the disgui of 
philosophi a well a of poetri and also becau ani departur from 
establish moral even where thi is not intend is apt to be 
unsettl it may be worth while to draw out a littl more at length 
the object to the platon marriag in the first place histori 
show that wherev polygami ha been larg allow the race ha 
deterior one man to one woman is the law of god and natur nearli 
all the civil peopl of the world at some period befor the age of 
written record have becom monogamist and the step when onc taken 
ha never been retrac the except occur among brahmin or 
mahometan or the ancient persian are of that sort which may be said 
to prove the rule the connexion form between superior and 
inferior race hardli ever produc a nobl offspr becau they are 
licenti and becau the child in such case usual despi the 
mother and are neglect by the father who is asham of them 
barbar nation when they are introduc by european to vice die 
out polygamist peopl either import and adopt child from other 
countri or dwindl in number or both dynasti and aristocraci

they grow older of passion licenti the common prostitut 
rare ha ani offspr by such unmistak evid is the author 
of moral assert in the relat of the sex and so mani more 
element enter into thi mysteri than are dream of by plato and some 
other philosoph 

recent enquir have ind arriv at the conclu that among 
primit tribe there exist a commun of wife a of properti and 
that the captiv taken by the spear wa the onli wife or slave whom ani 
man wa permit to call hi own the partial exist of such custom 
among some of the lower race of man and the surviv of peculiar 
ceremoni in the marriag of some civil nation are thought to 
furnish a proof of similar institut have been onc univ 
there can be no question that the studi of anthropolog ha consid 
chang our view respect the first appear of man upon the earth 
we know more about the aborigin of the world than formerli but our 
increa knowledg show abov all thing how littl we know with all 
the help which written monument afford we do but faintli realiz the 
condit of man two thousand or three thousand year ago of what hi 
condit wa when remov to a distanc 200 000 or 300 000 year when 
the major of mankind were lower and nearer the anim than ani tribe 
now exist upon the earth we cannot even entertain conjectur plato 
law and aristotl metaph may have been more right than we imagin 
in suppo that some form of civili were discov and lost 
sever time over if we cannot argu that all barbar is a degrad 
civil neither can we set ani limit to the depth of degrad 
to which the human race may sink through war disea or isol 
and if we are to draw infer about the origin of marriag from 
the practic of barbar nation we should also consid the 
remot analog of the anim mani bird and anim especi the 
carnivor have onli one mate and the love and care of offspr 
which seem to be natur is inconsist with the primit theori of 
marriag if we go back to an imaginari state in which men were almost 
anim and the companion of them we have a much right to argu from 
what is anim to what is human a from the barbar to the civil 
man the record of anim life on the globe is fragmentari the 
connect link are want and cannot be suppli the record of 
social life is still more fragmentari and precari even if we admit 
that our first ancestor had no such institut a marriag still 
the stage by which men pa from outer barbar to the compar 
civil of china assyria and greec or even of the ancient 
german are wholli unknown to u 

such specul are apt to be unsettl becau they seem to show 
that an institut which wa thought to be a revel from heaven is 
onli the growth of histori and experi we ask what is the origin of 
marriag and we are told that like the right of properti after mani 
war and contest it ha gradual arisen out of the selfish of 
barbarian we stand face to face with human natur in it primit 
nake we are compel to accept not the highest but the lowest 
account of the origin of human societi but on the other hand we 
may truli say that everi step in human progress ha been in the same 
direct and that in the cour of age the idea of marriag and of 
the famili ha been more and more defin and consecr the civil 
east is immeasur in advanc of ani savag tribe the greek and 
roman have improv upon the east the christian nation have been 
stricter in their view of the marriag relat than ani of the 
ancient in thi a in so mani other thing instead of look back 
with regret to the past we should look forward with hope to the futur 
we must consecr that which we believ to be the most holi and that 
which is the most holi will be the most use there is more reason 
for maintain the sacr of the marriag tie when we see the 
benefit of it than when we onli felt a vagu religi horror about 
the violat of it but in all time of transit when establish 
belief are be undermin there is a danger that in the passag from 
the old to the new we may insen let go the moral principl find 
an excu for listen to the voic of passion in the uncertainti of 
knowledg or the fluctuat of opinion and there are mani person 
in our own day who enlighten by the studi of anthropolog and 
fascin by what is new and strang some use the languag of fear 
other of hope are inclin to believ that a time will come when 
through the self assert of woman or the rebelli spirit of 
child by the analysi of human relat or by the forc of outward 
circumst the tie of famili life may be broken or greatli relax 
they point to societi in america and elsewh which tend to show that 
the destruct of the famili need not necessarili involv the overthrow 
of all moral wherev we may think of such specul we can 
hardli deni that they have been more rife in thi gener than in ani 
other and whither they are tend who can predict 

to the doubt and queri rai by these social reform respect 
the relat of the sex and the moral natur of man there is a 
suffici answer if ani is need the differ about them and u is 
realli one of fact they are speak of man a they wish or fanci him 
to be but we are speak of him a he is they isol the anim 
part of hi natur we regard him a a creatur have mani side or 
aspect move between good and evil strive to rise abov himself 
and to becom a littl lower than the angel we also to use 
a platon formula are not ignor of the dissatisfact and 
incompat of famili life of the mean of trade of the 
flatteri of one class of societi by anoth of the impedi which 
the famili throw in the way of lofti aim and aspir but we are 
consciou that there are evil and danger in the background greater 
still which are not appreci becau they are either conceal 
or suppress what a condit of man would that be in which human 
passion were control by no author divin or human in which 
there wa no shame or decenc no higher affect overcom or 
sanctifi the natur instinct but simpli a rule of health is it 
for thi that we are ask to throw away the civil which is the 
growth of age 

for strength and health are not the onli qualiti to be desir there 
are the more import consid of mind and charact and soul we 
know how human natur may be degrad we do not know how by artifici 
mean ani improv in the breed can be effect the problem is a 
complex one for if we go back onli four step and these at least enter 
into the composit of a child there are commonli thirti progenitor 
to be taken into account mani curiou fact rare admit of proof 
are told u respect the inherit of disea or charact from a 
remot ancestor we can trace the physic resembl of parent and 
child in the same famili 

sic oculo sic ill manu sic o ferebat 

but scarc le often the differ which distinguish child both 
from their parent and from one anoth we are told of similar mental 
peculiar run in famili and again of a tendenc a in 
the anim to revert to a common or origin stock but we have a 
difficulti in distinguish what is a true inherit of geniu or 
other qualiti and what is mere imit or the result of similar 
circumst great men and great woman have rare had great father 
and mother noth that we know of in the circumst of their birth 
or lineag will explain their appear of the english poet of the 
last and two prece centuri scarc a descend remain none 
have ever been distinguish so deepli ha natur hidden her secret 
and so ridicul is the fanci which ha been entertain by some that 
we might in time by suitabl marriag arrang or a plato would 
have said by an ingeni system of lot produc a shakespear or 
a milton even suppo that we could breed men have the tenac 
of bulldog or like the spartan lack the wit to run away 
in battl would the world be ani the better mani of the noblest 
specimen of the human race have been among the weakest physic 
tyrtaeu or aesop or our own newton would have been expo at sparta 
and some of the fairest and strongest men and woman have been among the 
wickedest and worst not by the platon devic of unit the strong 
and fair with the strong and fair regardless of sentiment and moral 
nor yet by hi other devic of combin dissimilar natur statesman 
have mankind gradual pa from the brutal and licenti of 
primit marriag to marriag christian and civil 

few person would deni that we bring into the world an inherit of 
mental and physic qualiti deriv first from our parent or through 
them from some remot ancestor secondli from our race thirdli from 
the gener condit of mankind into which we are born noth is 
common than the remark that so and so is like hi father or hi 
uncl and an age person may not unfrequ note a resembl in 
a youth to a long forgotten ancestor observ that natur sometim 
skip a gener it may be true also that if we knew more about 
our ancestor these similar would be even more strike to u 
admit the fact which are thu describ in a popular way we may 
howev remark that there is no method of differ by which they can 
be defin or estim and that they constitut onli a small part of 
each individu the doctrin of here may seem to take out of our 
hand the conduct of our own life but it is the idea not the fact 
which is realli terribl to u for what we have receiv from our 
ancestor is onli a fraction of what we are or may becom the 
knowledg that drunken or insan ha been preval in a 
famili may be the best safeguard against their recurr in a futur 
gener the parent will be most awak to the vice or disea in 
hi child of which he is most sensibl within himself the whole of life 
may be direct to their prevent or cure the trace of consumpt 
may becom fainter or be wholli effac the inher tendenc to vice 
or crime may be erad and so here from be a cur may 
becom a bless we acknowledg that in the matter of our birth a in 
our natur gener there are previou circumst which affect 
u but upon thi platform of circumst or within thi wall of 
necess we have still the power of creat a life for ourselv by 
the inform energi of the human will 

there is anoth aspect of the marriag question to which plato is a 
stranger all the child born in hi state are foundl it never 
occur to him that the greater part of them accord to univ 
experi would have perish for child can onli be brought up in 
famili there is a subtl sympathi between the mother and the child 
which cannot be suppli by other mother or by strong nur one or 
more law if plato s pen wa a fatal a the crech of pari or 
the foundl hospit of dublin more than nine tenth of hi child 
would have perish there would have been no need to expo or put 
out of the way the weaklier child for they would have die of 
themselv so emphat doe natur protest against the destruct 
of the famili 

what plato had heard or seen of sparta wa appli by him in a mistaken 
way to hi ideal commonwealth he probabl observ that both the 
spartan men and woman were superior in form and strength to the other 
greek and thi superior he wa dispo to attribut to the law 
and custom relat to marriag he did not consid that the desir 
of a nobl offspr wa a passion among the spartan or that their 
physic superior wa to be attribut chiefli not to their marriag 
custom but to their temper and train he did not reflect that 
sparta wa great not in consequ of the relax of moral but 
in spite of it by virtu of a polit principl stronger far than 
exist in ani other grecian state least of all did he observ that 
sparta did not realli produc the finest specimen of the greek 
race the geniu the polit inspir of athen the love of 
liberti all that ha made greec famou with poster were want 
among the spartan they had no themistocl or pericl or aeschylu 
or sophocl or socrat or plato the individu wa not allow to 
appear abov the state the law were fix and he had no busi to 
alter or reform them yet whenc ha the progress of citi and nation 
arisen if not from remark individu come into the world we 
know not how and from cau over which we have no control 
someth too much may have been said in modern time of the valu of 
individu but we can hardli condemn too strongli a system which 
instead of foster the scatter seed or spark of geniu and 
charact tend to smother and extinguish them 

still while condemn plato we must acknowledg that neither 
christian nor ani other form of religion and societi ha hitherto 
been abl to cope with thi most difficult of social problem and that 
the side from which plato regard it is that from which we turn away 
popul is the most untam forc in the polit and social 
world do we not find especi in larg citi that the greatest 
hindranc to the amelior of the poor is their improvid in 
marriag a small fault truli if not involv endless consequ 
there are whole countri too such a india or nearer home ireland 
in which a right solut of the marriag question seem to lie at the 
foundat of the happi of the commun there are too mani peopl 
on a given space or they marri too earli and bring into the world a 
sickli and half develop offspr or owe to the veri condit 
of their exist they becom emaci and hand on a similar life 
to their descend but who can oppo the voic of prudenc to the 
mightiest passion of mankind law especi when they have 
been licen by custom and religion in addit to the influenc of 
educ we seem to requir some new principl of right and wrong in 
these matter some forc of opinion which may ind be alreadi heard 
whisper in privat but ha never affect the moral sentiment 
of mankind in gener we unavoid lose sight of the principl of 
util just in that action of our life in which we have the most need 
of it the influenc which we can bring to bear upon thi question 
are chiefli indirect in a gener or two educ emigr 
improv in agricultur and manufactur may have provid the 
solut the state physician hardli like to probe the wound it is 
beyond hi art a matter which he cannot safe let alon but which he 
dare not touch 

we do but skin and film the ulcer place 

when again in privat life we see a whole famili one by one drop 
into the grave under the ate of some inherit maladi and the parent 
perhap surviv them do our mind ever go back silent to that day 
twenti five or thirti year befor on which under the fairest auspex 
amid the rejoic of friend and acquaint a bride and bridegroom 
join hand with one anoth in make such a reflect we are not 
oppo physic consid to moral but moral to physic we are 
seek to make the voic of reason heard which drive u back from the 
extravag of sentiment on common sen the late dr comb is 
said by hi biograph to have resist the temptat to marriag 
becau he knew that he wa subject to hereditari consumpt one who 
deserv to be call a man of geniu a friend of my youth wa in the 
habit of wear a black ribbon on hi wrist in order to remind him 
that be liabl to outbreak of insan he must not give way to the 
natur impul of affect he die unmarri in a lunat asylum 
these two littl fact suggest the reflect that a veri few person 
have done from a sen of duti what the rest of mankind ought to have 
done under like circumst if they had allow themselv to think 
of all the miseri which they were about to bring into the world if 
we could prevent such marriag without ani violat of feel or 
proprieti we clearli ought and the prohibit in the cour of time 
would be protect by a horror naturali similar to that which in 
all civil age and countri ha prevent the marriag of near 
relat by blood mankind would have been the happier if some thing 
which are now allow had from the begin been deni to them if the 
sanction of religion could have prohibit practic inim to health 
if sanitari principl could in earli age have been invest with a 
superst awe but live a we do far on in the world s histori 
we are no longer abl to stamp at onc with the impress of religion a 
new prohibit a free agent cannot have hi fanci regul by law 
and the execut of the law would be render imposs owe to the 
uncertainti of the case in which marriag wa to be forbidden who 
can weigh virtu or even fortun against health or moral and mental 
qualiti against bodili who can measur probabl against 
certainti there ha been some good a well a evil in the disciplin 
of suffer and there are disea such a consumpt which have 
exerci a refin and soften influenc on the charact youth is 
too inexperienc to balanc such nice consid parent do not 
often think of them or think of them too late they are at a distanc 
and may probabl be avert chang of place a new state of life the 
interest of a home may be the cure of them so person vainli reason 
when their mind are alreadi made up and their fortun irrevoc 
link togeth nor is there ani ground for suppo that marriag 
are to ani great extent influenc by reflect of thi sort which 
seem unabl to make ani head against the irresist impul of 
individu attach 

lastli no one can have observ the first rise flood of the passion 
in youth the difficulti of regul them and the effect on the 
whole mind and natur which follow from them the stimulu which 
is given to them by the imagin without feel that there is 
someth unsatisfactori in our method of treat them that the most 
import influenc on human life should be wholli left to chanc or 
shroud in mysteri and instead of be disciplin or understood 
should be requir to conform onli to an extern standard of 
proprieti cannot be regard by the philosoph a a safe or 
satisfactori condit of human thing and still those who have the 
charg of youth may find a way by watch by affect by the 
manli and innoc of their own life by occas hint by 
gener admonit which everi one can appli for himself to mitig 
thi terribl evil which eat out the heart of individu and corrupt 
the moral sentiment of nation in no duti toward other is there more 
need of retic and self restraint so great is the danger lest he who 
would be the counsellor of anoth should reveal the secret prematur 
lest he should get anoth too much into hi power or fix the pa 
impress of evil by demand the confess of it 

nor is plato wrong in assert that famili attach may interf 
with higher aim if there have been some who to parti gave up what wa 
meant for mankind there have certainli been other who to famili 
gave up what wa meant for mankind or for their countri the care 
of child the necess of procur money for their support the 
flatteri of the rich by the poor the exclu of cast the 
pride of birth or wealth the tendenc of famili life to divert men from 
the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic are a lower in our own age 
a in that of plato and if we prefer to look at the gentl influenc 
of home the develop of the affect the amen of societi 
the devot of one member of a famili for the good of the other which 
form one side of the pictur we must not quarrel with him or perhap 
ought rather to be grate to him for have present to u the 
rever without attempt to defend plato on ground of moral we 
may allow that there is an aspect of the world which ha not unnatur 
led him into error 

we hardli appreci the power which the idea of the state like all 
other abstract idea exerci over the mind of plato to u the state 
seem to be built up out of the famili or sometim to be the framework 
in which famili and social life is contain but to plato in hi 
present mood of mind the famili is onli a disturb influenc which 
instead of fill up tend to disarrang the higher uniti of the 
state no organ is need except a polit which 
regard from anoth point of view is a militari one the state is 
all suffic for the want of man and like the idea of the church in 
later age absorb all other desir and affect in time of war the 
thousand citizen are to stand like a rampart impregn against the 
world or the persian host in time of peac the prepar for war and 
their duti to the state which are also their duti to one anoth 
take up their whole life and time the onli other interest which is 
allow to them besid that of war is the interest of philosophi when 
they are too old to be soldier they are to retir from activ life 
and to have a second noviti of studi and contempl there is an 
element of monast even in plato s commun if he could have done 
without child he might have convert hi republ into a religi 
order neither in the law when the daylight of common sen break in 
upon him doe he retract hi error in the state of which he would be 
the founder there is no marri or give in marriag but becau of 
the infirm of mankind he condescend to allow the law of natur to 
prevail 

c but plato ha an equal or in hi own estim even greater 
paradox in reserv which is sum up in the famou text until king 
are philosoph or philosoph are king citi will never cea 
from ill and by philosoph he explain himself to mean those who 
are capabl of apprehend idea especi the idea of good to the 
attain of thi higher knowledg the second educ is direct 
through a process of train which ha alreadi made them good citizen 
they are now to be made good legisl we find with some surpri 
not unlik the feel which aristotl in a well known passag 
describ the hearer of plato s lectur a experienc when they 
went to a discour on the idea of good expect to be instruct in 
moral truth and receiv instead of them arithmet and mathemat 
formula that plato doe not propo for hi futur legisl ani 
studi of financ or law or militari tactic but onli of abstract 
mathemat a a prepar for the still more abstract concept of 
good we ask with aristotl what is the use of a man know the idea 
of good if he doe not know what is good for thi individu thi 
state thi condit of societi we cannot understand how plato s 
legisl or guardian are to be fit for their work of statesman by 
the studi of the five mathemat scienc we vainli search in plato s 
own write for ani explan of thi seem absurd 

the discoveri of a great metaphi concept seem to ravish the 
mind with a prophet consciou which take away the power 
of estim it valu no metaphi enquir ha ever fairli 
critici hi own specul in hi own judgment they have been 
abov critic nor ha he understood that what to him seem to be 
absolut truth may reappear in the next gener a a form of logic 
or an instrument of thought and poster have also sometim equal 
misapprehend the real valu of hi specul they appear to them 
to have contribut noth to the stock of human knowledg the idea 
of good is apt to be regard by the modern thinker a an unmean 
abstract but he forget that thi abstract is wait readi for 
use and will hereaft be fill up by the divi of knowledg 
when mankind do not a yet know that the world is subject to law the 
introduct of the mere concept of law or design or final cau and 
the far off anticip of the harmoni of knowledg are great step 
onward even the crude gener of the uniti of all thing lead 
men to view the world with differ eye and may easili affect their 
concept of human life and of polit and also their own conduct and 
charact tim we can imagin how a great mind like that of pericl 
might deriv elev from hi intercour with anaxagora phaedr 
to be struggl toward a higher but unattain concept is a more 
favour intellectu condit than to rest satisfi in a narrow 
portion of ascertain fact and the earlier which have sometim been 
the greater idea of scienc are often lost sight of at a later period 
how rare can we say of ani modern enquir in the magnif languag 
of plato that he is the spectat of all time and of all exist 

nor is there anyth unnatur in the hasti applic of these vast 
metaphi concept to practic and polit life in the first 
enthusiasm of idea men are apt to see them everywh and to appli 
them in the most remot sphere they do not understand that the 
experi of age is requir to enabl them to fill up the 
intermedi axiom plato himself seem to have imagin that the 
truth of psycholog like those of astronomi and harmon would be 
arriv at by a process of deduct and that the method which he ha 
pursu in the fourth book of infer them from experi and the 
use of languag wa imperfect and onli provis but when after 
have arriv at the idea of good which is the end of the scienc of 
dialect he is ask what is the natur and what are the divi 
of the scienc he refu to answer a if intend by the refu to 
intim that the state of knowledg which then exist wa not such a 
would allow the philosoph to enter into hi final rest the previou 
scienc must first be studi and will we may add continu to be 
studi tell the end of time although in a sen differ from ani 
which plato could have conceiv but we may observ that while he is 
awar of the vacanc of hi own ideal he is full of enthusiasm in the 
contempl of it look into the orb of light he see noth but 
he is warm and elev the hebrew prophet believ that faith in 
god would enabl him to govern the world the greek philosoph imagin 
that contempl of the good would make a legisl there is a much 
to be fill up in the one case a in the other and the one mode of 
concept is to the israelit what the other is to the greek both find 
a repo in a divin perfect which whether in a more person or 
imperson form exist without them and independ of them a well 
a within them 

there is no mention of the idea of good in the timaeu nor of the 
divin creator of the world in the republ and we are natur led 
to ask in what relat they stand to one anoth is god abov or below 
the idea of good or is the idea of good anoth mode of conceiv god 
the latter appear to be the truer answer to the greek philosoph 
the perfect and uniti of god wa a far higher concept than hi 
person which he hardli found a word to express and which to him 
would have seem to be borrow from mytholog to the christian on 
the other hand or to the modern thinker in gener it is difficult 
if not imposs to attach realiti to what he term mere abstract 
while to plato thi veri abstract is the truest and most real of all 
thing henc from a differ in form of thought plato appear to 
be rest on a creation of hi own mind onli but if we may be allow 
to paraphra the idea of good by the word intellig principl of 
law and order in the univ embrac equal man and natur we 
begin to find a meet point between him and ourselv 

the question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosoph is 
one that ha not lost interest in modern time in most countri of 
europ and asia there ha been some one in the cour of age who 
ha truli unit the power of command with the power of thought and 
reflect a there have been also mani fal combin of these 
qualiti some kind of specul power is necessari both in practic 
and polit life like the rhetorician in the phaedru men requir to 
have a concept of the varieti of human charact and to be rai 
on great occa abov the commonplac of ordinari life yet the idea 
of the philosoph statesman ha never been popular with the mass of 
mankind partli becau he cannot take the world into hi confid or 
make them understand the motif from which he act and also becau 
they are jealou of a power which they do not understand the revolut 
which human natur desir to effect step by step in mani age is like 
to be precipit by him in a singl year or life they are afraid that 
in the pursuit of hi greater aim he may disregard the common feel 
of human he is too apt to be look into the distant futur or back 
into the remot past and unabl to see action or event which to use 
an express of plato s are tumbl out at hi foot besid a 
plato would say there are other corrupt of these philosoph 
statesman either the nativ hue of resolut is sickli o er with 
the pale cast of thought and at the moment when action abov all 
thing is requir he is undecid or gener principl are enunci 
by him in order to cover some chang of polici or hi ignor of the 
world ha made him more easili fall a prey to the art of other or in 
some case he ha been convert into a courtier who enjoy the luxuri 
of hold liber opinion but wa never known to perform a liber 
action no wonder that mankind have been in the habit of call 
statesman of thi class pedant sophist doctrinair visionari 
for a we may be allow to say a littl parodi the word of plato 
they have seen bad imit of the philosoph statesman but a man 
in whom the power of thought and action are perfectli balanc equal to 
the present reach forward to the futur such a one rule in a 
constitut state they have never seen 

but a the philosoph is apt to fail in the routin of polit life 
so the ordinari statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinari crisi 
when the face of the world is begin to alter and thunder is heard 
in the distanc he is still guid by hi old maxim and is the slave 
of hi invet parti prejud he cannot perceiv the sign of the 
time instead of look forward he look back he learn noth and 
forget noth with wise saw and modern instanc he would stem the 
rise tide of revolut he life more and more within the circl of 
hi own parti a the world without him becom stronger thi seem to 
be the reason whi the old order of thing make so poor a figur 
when confront with the new whi church can never reform whi most 
polit chang are made blindli and convul the great crisi 
in the histori of nation have often been met by an ecclesiast 
posit and a more obstin reassert of principl which 
have lost their hold upon a nation the fix idea of a reactionari 
statesman may be compar to mad they grow upon him and he becom 
poss by them no judgement of other is ever admit by him to be 
weigh in the balanc against hi own 

d plato labour under what to modern reader appear to have been 
a confu of idea assimil the state to the individu and fail 
to distinguish ethic from polit he think that to be most of a 
state which is most like one man and in which the citizen have the 
greatest uniform of charact he doe not see that the analog is 
partli fallaci and that the will or charact of a state or nation 
is realli the balanc or rather the surplu of individu will which 
are limit by the condit of have to act in common the movement 
of a bodi of men can never have the plianci or facil of a singl man 
the freedom of the individu which is alway limit becom still 
more straiten when transfer to a nation the power of action and 
feel are necessarili weaker and more balanc when they are diffu 
through a commun whenc ari the often discu question can a 
nation like an individu have a conscienc we hesit to say 
that the charact of nation are noth more than the sum of the 
charact of the individu who compo them becau there may be 
tendenc in individu which react upon one anoth a whole nation 
may be wiser than ani one man in it or may be anim by some common 
opinion or feel which could not equal have affect the mind of 
a singl person or may have been inspir by a leader of geniu to 
perform act more than human plato doe not appear to have anali 
the complic which ari out of the collect action of mankind 
neither is he capabl of see that analog though speciou a 
argument may often have no foundat in fact or of distinguish 
between what is intellig or vividli present to the mind and what 
is true in thi respect he is far below aristotl who is compar 
seldom impo upon by fal analog he cannot disentangl the art 
from the virtu at least he is alway argu from one to the other 
hi notion of music is transfer from harmoni of sound to harmoni of 
life in thi he is assist by the ambigu of languag a well a 
by the preval of pythagorean notion and have onc assimil 
the state to the individu he imago that he will find the 
success of state parallel in the life of individu 

still through thi fallaci medium a real enlarg of idea is 
attain when the virtu a yet present no distinct concept to 
the mind a great advanc wa made by the comparison of them with the 
art for virtu is partli art and ha an outward form a well a an 
inward principl the harmoni of music afford a live imag of the 
harmoni of the world and of human life and may be regard a a 
splendid illustr which wa natur mistaken for a real analog 
in the same way the identif of ethic with polit ha a 
tendenc to give definit to ethic and also to elev and ennobl 
men s notion of the aim of govern and of the duti of citizen 
for ethic from one point of view may be conceiv a an ideal law 
and polit and polit a ethic reduc to the condit of human 
societi there have been evil which have arisen out of the attempt to 
identifi them and thi ha led to the separ or antagon of 
them which ha been introduc by modern polit writer but we may 
likewi feel that someth ha been lost in their separ and 
that the ancient philosoph who estim the moral and intellectu 
wellb of mankind first and the wealth of nation and individu 
second may have a salutari influenc on the specul of modern 
time mani polit maxim origin in a reaction against an opposit 
error and when the error against which they were direct have pa 
away they in turn becom error 

3 plato s view of educ are in sever respect remark 
like the rest of the republ they are partli greek and partli ideal 
begin with the ordinari curriculum of the greek youth and extend 
to after life plato is the first writer who distinctli say that 
educ is to comprehend the whole of life and to be a prepar 
for anoth in which educ begin again thi is the continu 
thread which run through the republ and which more than ani other of 
hi idea admit of an applic to modern life 

he ha long given up the notion that virtu cannot be taught and he is 
dispo to modifi the thesi of the protagora that the virtu are 
one and not mani he is not unwil to admit the sensibl world 
into hi scheme of truth nor doe he assert in the republ the 
involuntari of vice which is maintain by him in the timaeu 
sophist and law protag apol gorg nor do the so call platon 
idea recov from a former state of exist affect hi theori 
of mental improv still we observ in him the remain of the old 
socrat doctrin that true knowledg must be elicit from within and 
is to be sought for in idea not in particular of sen educ a 
he say will implant a principl of intellig which is better than 
ten thousand eye the paradox that the virtu are one and the kindr 
notion that all virtu is knowledg are not entir renounc the 
first is seen in the supremaci given to justic over the rest the 
second in the tendenc to absorb the moral virtu in the intellectu 
and to centr all good in the contempl of the idea of good the 
world of sen is still depreci and identifi with opinion though 
admit to be a shadow of the true in the republ he is evid 
impress with the convict that vice ari chiefli from ignor 
and may be cure by educ the multitud are hardli to be deem 
respon for what they do a faint allu to the doctrin of 
reminisc occur in the tenth book but plato s view of educ 
have no more real connect with a previou state of exist than 
our own he onli propo to elicit from the mind that which is there 
alreadi educ is repr by him not a the fill of a 
vessel but a the turn the eye of the soul toward the light 

he treat first of music or literatur which he divid into true and 
fal and then go on to gymnast of infanc in the republ he 
take no notic though in the law he give sage counsel about the 
nur of child and the manag of the mother and would have 
an educ which is even prior to birth but in the republ he begin 
with the age at which the child is capabl of receiv idea and 
boldli assert in languag which sound paradox to modern ear 
that he must be taught the fal befor he can learn the true the 
modern and ancient philosoph world are not agr about truth and 
falsehood the one identifi truth almost exclu with fact the 
other with idea thi is the differ between ourselv and plato 
which is howev partli a differ of word for we too should admit 
that a child must receiv mani lesson which he imperfectli understand 
he must be taught some thing in a figur onli some too which he can 
hardli be expect to believ when he grow older but we should limit 
the use of fiction by the necess of the case plato would draw the 
line differ accord to him the aim of earli educ is not 
truth a a matter of fact but truth a a matter of principl the child 
is to be taught first simpl religi truth and then simpl moral 
truth and insen to learn the lesson of good manner and good 
tast he would make an entir reform of the old mytholog like 
xenophan and heracleitu he is sensibl of the deep chasm which 
separ hi own age from homer and hesiod whom he quot and invest 
with an imaginari author but onli for hi own purpo the lust 
and treacheri of the god are to be banish the terror of the world 
below are to be dispel the misbehaviour of the homer hero is 
not to be a model for youth but there is anoth strain heard in homer 
which may teach our youth endur and someth may be learnt in 
medicin from the simpl practic of the homer age the principl 
on which religion is to be base are two onli first that god is true 
secondli that he is good modern and christian writer have often 
fallen short of these they can hardli be said to have gone beyond them 

the young are to be brought up in happi surround out of the way of 
sight or sound which may hurt the charact or vitiat the tast 
they are to live in an atmosph of health the breez is alway to 
be waft to them the impress of truth and good could such 
an educ be realiz or if our modern religi educ could 
be bound up with truth and virtu and good manner and good tast that 
would be the best hope of human improv plato like ourselv 
is look forward to chang in the moral and religi world and is 
prepar for them he recogn the danger of unsettl young men s 
mind by sudden chang of law and principl by destroy the 
sacr of one set of idea when there is noth el to take their 
place he is afraid too of the influenc of the drama on the ground 
that it encourag fal sentiment and therefor he would not have 
hi child taken to the theatr he think that the effect on the 
spectat is bad and on the actor still wor hi idea of educ 
is that of harmoni growth in which are insen learnt the lesson 
of temper and endur and the bodi and mind develop in equal 
proport the first principl which run through all art and natur 
is simplic thi also is to be the rule of human life 

the second stage of educ is gymnast which answer to the period 
of muscular growth and develop the simplic which is enforc in 
music is extend to gymnast plato is awar that the train of the 
bodi may be inconsist with the train of the mind and that bodili 
exerci may be easili overdon excess train of the bodi is 
apt to give men a headach or to render them sleepi at a lectur on 
philosophi and thi they attribut not to the true cau but to the 
natur of the subject two point are notic in plato s treatment of 
gymnast first that the time of train is entir separ from 
the time of literari educ he seem to have thought that two thing 
of an opposit and differ natur could not be learnt at the same 
time here we can hardli agr with him and if we may judg by 
experi the effect of spend three year between the age of 
fourteen and seventeen in mere bodili exerci would be far from 
improv to the intellect secondli he affirm that music and 
gymnast are not a common opinion is apt to imagin intend the 
one for the cultiv of the mind and the other of the bodi but that 
they are both equal design for the improv of the mind the 
bodi in hi view is the servant of the mind the subject of the 
lower to the higher is for the advantag of both and doubtless the 
mind may exerci a veri great and paramount influenc over the bodi 
if exert not at particular moment and by fit and start but 
continu in make prepar for the whole of life other greek 
writer saw the mischiev tendenc of spartan disciplin arist pol 
thuc but onli plato recogn the fundament error on which the 
practic wa base 

the subject of gymnast lead plato to the sister subject of medicin 
which he further illustr by the parallel of law the modern 
disbelief in medicin ha led in thi a in some other depart of 
knowledg to a demand for greater simplic physician are becom 
awar that they often make disea greater and more complic by 
their treatment of them rep in two thousand year their art ha made 
but slender progress what they have gain in the analysi of the part 
is in a great degr lost by their feebler concept of the human frame 
a a whole they have attend more to the cure of disea than to the 
condit of health and the improv in medicin have been more 
than counterbalanc by the disu of regular train until late 
they have hardli thought of air and water the import of which wa 
well understood by the ancient a aristotl remark air and water 
be the element which we most use have the greatest effect upon 
health polit for age physician have been under the dominion of 
prejud which have onli recent given way and now there are a mani 
opinion in medicin a in theolog and an equal degr of sceptic 
and some want of toler about both plato ha sever good notion 
about medicin accord to him the eye cannot be cure without the 
rest of the bodi nor the bodi without the mind charm no man 
of sen he say in the timaeu would take physic and we heartili 
sympath with him in the law when he declar that the limb of the 
rustic worn with toil will deriv more benefit from warm bath than from 
the prescript of a not over wise doctor but we can hardli prai 
him when in obedi to the author of homer he depreci diet 
or approv of the inhuman spirit in which he would get rid of invalid 
and useless life by leav them to die he doe not seem to have 
consid that the bridl of theag might be accompani by 
qualiti which were of far more valu to the state than the health 
or strength of the citizen or that the duti of take care of the 
helpless might be an import element of educ in a state the 
physician himself thi is a delic and subtl observ should 
not be a man in robust health he should have in modern phraseolog 
a nervou tempera he should have experi of disea in hi own 
person in order that hi power of observ may be quicken in the 
case of other 

the perplex of medicin is parallel by the perplex of law in 
which again plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplic 
greater matter are to be determin by the legisl or by the oracl 
of delphi lesser matter are to be left to the temporari regul 
of the citizen themselv plato is awar that laissez fair is an 
import element of govern the disea of a state are like the 
head of a hydra they multipli when they are cut off the true remedi 
for them is not extirp but prevent and the way to prevent them 
is to take care of educ and educ will take care of all the 
rest so in modern time men have often felt that the onli polit 
measur worth have the onli one which would produc ani certain or 
last effect wa a measur of nation educ and in our own more 
than in ani previou age the necess ha been recogn of restor 
the ever increa confu of law to simplic and common sen 

when the train in music and gymnast is complet there follow the 
first stage of activ and public life but soon educ is to begin 
again from a new point of view in the interv between the fourth and 
seventh book we have discu the natur of knowledg and have thenc 
been led to form a higher concept of what wa requir of u for 
true knowledg accord to plato is of abstract and ha to do 
not with particular or individu but with univ onli not with 
the beauti of poetri but with the idea of philosophi and the great 
aim of educ is the cultiv of the habit of abstract thi 
is to be acquir through the studi of the mathemat scienc they 
alon are capabl of give idea of relat and of arou the 
dormant energi of thought 

mathemat in the age of plato comprehend a veri small part of that 
which is now includ in them but they bore a much larger proport to 
the sum of human knowledg they were the onli organon of thought which 
the human mind at that time poss and the onli measur by which 
the chao of particular could be reduc to rule and order the 
faculti which they train wa natur at war with the poetic 
or imagin and henc to plato who is everywh seek for 
abstract and tri to get rid of the illu of sen nearli 
the whole of educ is contain in them they seem to have an 
inexhaust applic partli becau their true limit were not yet 
understood these plato himself is begin to investig though 
not awar that number and figur are mere abstract of sen 
he recogn that the form use by geometri are borrow from the 
sensibl world he seek to find the ultim ground of mathemat 
idea in the idea of good though he doe not satisfactorili explain the 
connexion between them and in hi concept of the relat of idea 
to number he fall veri far short of the definit attribut to 
him by aristotl met but if he fail to recogn the true limit of 
mathemat he also reach a point beyond them in hi view idea 
of number becom secondari to a higher concept of knowledg the 
dialectician is a much abov the mathematician a the mathematician is 
abov the ordinari man the one the self prove the good which is 
the higher sphere of dialect is the perfect truth to which all thing 
ascend and in which they final repo 

thi self prove uniti or idea of good is a mere vision of which no 
distinct explan can be given rel onli to a particular stage 
in greek philosophi it is an abstract under which no individu 
are comprehend a whole which ha no part arist nic eth the 
vacanc of such a form wa perceiv by aristotl but not by plato 
nor did he recogn that in the dialect process are includ two or 
more method of investig which are at varianc with each other 
he did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road no 
advanc could be made in thi way and yet such vision often have an 
immen effect for although the method of scienc cannot anticip 
scienc the idea of scienc not a it is but a it will be in the 
futur is a great and inspir principl in the pursuit of knowledg 
we are alway press forward to someth beyond u and a a fal 
concept of knowledg for exampl the scholast philosophi may lead 
men astray dure mani age so the true ideal though vacant may draw 
all their thought in a right direct it make a great differ 
whether the gener expect of knowledg a thi indefinit feel 
may be term is base upon a sound judgment for mankind may often 
entertain a true concept of what knowledg ought to be when they have 
but a slender experi of fact the correl of the scienc the 
consciou of the uniti of natur the idea of classif the 
sen of proport the unwil to stop short of certainti or to 
confound probabl with truth are import principl of the higher 
educ although plato could tell u noth and perhap knew that 
he could tell u noth of the absolut truth he ha exerci 
an influenc on the human mind which even at the present day is not 
exhaust and polit and social question may yet ari in which the 
thought of plato may be read anew and receiv a fresh mean 

the idea of good is so call onli in the republ but there are trace 
of it in other dialogu of plato it is a cau a well a an idea and 
from thi point of view may be compar with the creator of the timaeu 
who out of hi good creat all thing it correspond to a certain 
extent with the modern concept of a law of natur or of a final 
cau or of both in one and in thi regard may be connect with the 
measur and symmetri of the philebu it is repr in the symposium 
under the aspect of beauti and is suppo to be attain there by 
stage of initi a here by regular gradat of knowledg view 
subject it is the process or scienc of dialect thi is the 
scienc which accord to the phaedru is the true basi of rhetor 
which alon is abl to distinguish the natur and class of men and 
thing which divid a whole into the natur part and reunit the 
scatter part into a natur or organ whole which defin the 
abstract essenc or univ idea of all thing and connect them 
which pierc the veil of hypothesi and reach the final cau or 
first principl of all which regard the scienc in relat to the 
idea of good thi ideal scienc is the highest process of thought 
and may be describ a the soul conver with herself or hold 
communion with etern truth and beauti and in anoth form is 
the everlast question and answer the ceaseless interrog of 
socrat the dialogu of plato are themselv exampl of the natur 
and method of dialect view object the idea of good is a power 
or cau which make the world without u correspond with the world 
within yet thi world without u is still a world of idea with plato 
the investig of natur is anoth depart of knowledg and in 
thi he seek to attain onli probabl conclu timaeu 

if we ask whether thi scienc of dialect which plato onli half 
explain to u is more akin to logic or to metaphi the answer is 
that in hi mind the two scienc are not a yet distinguish ani more 
than the subject and object aspect of the world and of man which 
german philosophi ha reveal to u nor ha he determin whether 
hi scienc of dialect is at rest or in motion concern with the 
contempl of absolut be or with a process of develop 
and evolut modern metaphi may be describ a the scienc of 
abstract or a the scienc of the evolut of thought modern 
logic when pa beyond the bound of mere aristotelian form may be 
defin a the scienc of method the germ of both of them is contain 
in the platon dialect all metaphysician have someth in common 
with the idea of plato all logician have deriv someth from 
the method of plato the nearest approach in modern philosophi to the 
univ scienc of plato is to be found in the hegelian success 
of moment in the uniti of the idea plato and hegel alik seem to 
have conceiv the world a the correl of abstract and not 
imposs they would have understood one anoth better than ani of 
their comment understand them swift s voyag to laputa have 
a desir to see those ancient who were most renown for wit and 
learn i set apart one day on purpo i propo that homer and 
aristotl might appear at the head of all their comment but these 
were so numer that some hundr were forc to attend in the court 
and outward room of the palac i knew and could distinguish these two 
hero at first sight not onli from the crowd but from each other 
homer wa the taller and come person of the two walk veri erect 
for one of hi age and hi eye were the most quick and pierc i ever 
beheld aristotl stoop much and made use of a staff hi visag wa 
meagr hi hair lank and thin and hi voic hollow i soon discov 
that both of them were perfect stranger to the rest of the compani 
and had never seen or heard of them befor and i had a whisper from a 
ghost who shall be nameless that these comment alway kept in 
the most distant quarter from their princip in the lower world 
through a consciou of shame and guilt becau they had so horribl 
misrepr the mean of these author to poster i introduc 
didymu and eustathiu to homer and prevail on him to treat them 
better than perhap they deserv for he soon found they want a 
geniu to enter into the spirit of a poet but aristotl wa out of all 
patienc with the account i gave him of scotu and ramu a i present 
them to him and he ask them whether the rest of the tribe were a 
great dunc a themselv there is howev a differ between 
them for wherea hegel is think of all the mind of men a one mind 
which develop the stage of the idea in differ countri or at 
differ time in the same countri with plato these gradat are 
regard onli a an order of thought or idea the histori of the human 
mind had not yet dawn upon him 

mani critic may be made on plato s theori of educ while in 
some respect he unavoid fall short of modern thinker in other 
he is in advanc of them he is oppo to the mode of educ which 
prevail in hi own time but he can hardli be said to have discov 
new one he doe not see that educ is rel to the charact 
of individu he onli desir to impress the same form of the state on 
the mind of all he ha no suffici idea of the effect of literatur 
on the format of the mind and greatli exagg that of 
mathemat hi aim is abov all thing to train the reason 
faculti to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstract 
to explain and defin gener notion and if possibl to connect 
them no wonder that in the vacanc of actual knowledg hi follow 
and at time even he himself should have fallen away from the doctrin 
of idea and have return to that branch of knowledg in which alon 
the relat of the one and mani can be truli seen the scienc of 
number in hi view both of teach and train he might be style 
in modern languag a doctrinair after the spartan fashion he would 
have hi citizen cast in one mould he doe not seem to consid that 
some degr of freedom a littl wholesom neglect is necessari to 
strengthen and develop the charact and to give play to the individu 
natur hi citizen would not have acquir that knowledg which in 
the vision of er is suppo to be gain by the pilgrim from their 
experi of evil 

on the other hand plato is far in advanc of modern philosoph and 
theologian when he teach that educ is to be continu through 
life and will begin again in anoth he would never allow educ of 
some kind to cea although he wa awar that the proverbi say of 
solon i grow old learn mani thing cannot be appli liter 
himself ravish with the contempl of the idea of good and 
delight in solid geometri rep he ha no difficulti in imagin 
that a lifetim might be pa happili in such pursuit we who know 
how mani more men of busi there are in the world than real student 
or thinker are not equal sanguin the educ which he propo 
for hi citizen is realli the ideal life of the philosoph or man of 
geniu interrupt but onli for a time by practic duti a life 
not for the mani but for the few 

yet the thought of plato may not be wholli incap of applic to 
our own time even if regard a an ideal which can never be realiz 
it may have a great effect in elev the charact of mankind 
and rai them abov the routin of their ordinari occup or 
profess it is the best form under which we can conceiv the whole 
of life nevertheless the idea of plato is not easili put into practic 
for the educ of after life is necessarili the educ which each 
one give himself men and woman cannot be brought togeth in school 
or colleg at forti or fifti year of age and if they could the result 
would be disappoint the destin of most men is what plato would 
call the den for the whole of life and with that they are content 
neither have they teacher or advi with whom they can take counsel 
in riper year there is no schoolmast abroad who will tell them of 
their fault or inspir them with the higher sen of duti or with the 
ambit of a true success in life no socrat who will convict them 
of ignor no christ or follow of christ who will reprov them 
of sin henc they have a difficulti in receiv the first element of 
improv which is self knowledg the hope of youth no longer stir 
them they rather wish to rest than to pursu high object a few 
onli who have come across great men and woman or emin teacher of 
religion and moral have receiv a second life from them and have 
light a candl from the fire of their geniu 

the want of energi is one of the main reason whi so few person 
continu to improv in later year they have not the will and do not 
know the way they never tri an experi or look up a point 
of interest for themselv they make no sacrif for the sake of 
knowledg their mind like their bodi at a certain age becom 
fix geniu ha been defin a the power of take pain but 
hardli ani one keep up hi interest in knowledg throughout a whole 
life the troubl of a famili the busi of make money the 
demand of a profess destroy the elast of the mind the waxen 
tablet of the memori which wa onc capabl of receiv true thought 
and clear impress becom hard and crowd there is not room 
for the accumul of a long life theaet the student a year 
advanc rather make an exchang of knowledg than add to hi store 
there is no press necess to learn the stock of classic or 
histori or natur scienc which wa enough for a man at twenti five is 
enough for him at fifti neither is it easi to give a definit answer to 
ani one who ask how he is to improv for self educ consist in a 
thousand thing commonplac in themselv in ad to what we are 
by natur someth of what we are not in learn to see ourselv a 
other see u in judg not by opinion but by the evid of fact 
in seek out the societi of superior mind in a studi of life and 
write of great men in observ of the world and charact in 
receiv kindli the natur influenc of differ time of life in 
ani act or thought which is rai abov the practic or opinion of 
mankind in the pursuit of some new or origin enquiri in ani effort 
of mind which call forth some latent power 

if ani one is desir of carri out in detail the platon educ 
of after life some such counsel a the follow may be offer to 
him that he shall choo the branch of knowledg to which hi own mind 
most distinctli inclin and in which he take the greatest delight 
either one which seem to connect with hi own daili employ or 
perhap furnish the greatest contrast to it he may studi from the 
specul side the profess or busi in which he is practic 
engag he may make homer dant shakespear plato bacon the friend 
and companion of hi life he may find opportun of hear the 
live voic of a great teacher he may select for enquiri some point of 
histori or some unexplain phenomenon of natur an hour a day pa 
in such scientif or literari pursuit will furnish a mani fact a 
the memori can retain and will give him a pleasur not to be repent 
of timaeu onli let him bewar of be the slave of crotchet or 
of run after a will o the wisp in hi ignor or in hi vaniti 
of attribut to himself the gift of a poet or assum the air of 
a philosoph he should know the limit of hi own power better to 
build up the mind by slow addit to creep on quietli from one 
thing to anoth to gain insen new power and new interest in 
knowledg than to form vast scheme which are never destin to be 
realiz but perhap a plato would say thi is part of anoth 
subject tim though we may also defend our digress by hi exampl 
theaet 

4 we remark with surpri that the progress of nation or the natur 
growth of institut which fill modern treati on polit 
philosophi seem hardli ever to have attract the attent of plato 
and aristotl the ancient were familiar with the mutabl of human 
affair they could moral over the ruin of citi and the fall of 
empir plato statesman and sulpiciu letter to cicero by them 
fate and chanc were deem to be real power almost person and 
to have had a great share in polit event the wiser of them like 
thucydid believ that what had been would be again and that a 
toler idea of the futur could be gather from the past also they 
had dream of a golden age which exist onc upon a time and might 
still exist in some unknown land or might return again in the remot 
futur but the regular growth of a state enlighten by experi 
progress in knowledg improv in the art of which the citizen 
were educ by the fulfil of polit duti appear never to 
have come within the rang of their hope and aspir such a state 
had never been seen and therefor could not be conceiv by them their 
experi aristot metaph plato law led them to conclud that 
there had been cycl of civil in which the art had been 
discov and lost mani time over and citi had been overthrown and 
rebuilt again and again and delug and volcano and other natur 
convul had alter the face of the earth tradit told them of 
mani destruct of mankind and of the preserv of a remnant 
the world began again after a delug and wa reconstruct out of the 
fragment of itself also they were acquaint with empir of unknown 
antiqu like the egyptian or assyrian but they had never seen them 
grow and could not imagin ani more than we can the state of man 
which prece them they were puzzl and awestricken by the egyptian 
monument of which the form a plato say not in a figur but 
liter were ten thousand year old law and they contrast the 
antiqu of egypt with their own short memori 

the earli legend of hella have no real connect with the later 
histori they are at a distanc and the intermedi region is 
conceal from view there is no road or path which lead from one to 
the other at the begin of greek histori in the vestibul of the 
templ is seen stand first of all the figur of the legisl 
himself the interpret and servant of the god the fundament law 
which he give are not suppo to chang with time and circumst 
the salvat of the state is held rather to depend on the inviol 
mainten of them they were sanction by the author of heaven 
and it wa deem impieti to alter them the desir to maintain 
them unalt seem to be the origin of what at first sight is veri 
surpri to u the intol zeal of plato against innov in 
religion or polit law although with a happi inconsist he 
is also will that the law of other countri should be studi and 
improv in legisl privat commun to the nocturn 
council law the addit which were made to them in later age in 
order to meet the increa complex of affair were still ascrib 
by a fiction to the origin legisl and the word of such 
enact at athen were disput over a if they had been the word of 
solon himself plato hope to preserv in a later gener the mind of 
the legisl he would have hi citizen remain within the line 
which he ha laid down for them he would not harass them with minut 
regul he would have allow some chang in the law but not 
chang which would affect the fundament institut of the state 
such for exampl a would convert an aristocraci into a timocraci or a 
timocraci into a popular form of govern 

pa from specul to fact we observ that progress ha been 
the except rather than the law of human histori and therefor we are 
not surpri to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather than 
of ancient date and like the idea of a philosophi of histori is 
not more than a centuri or two old it seem to have arisen out of the 
impress left on the human mind by the growth of the roman empir 
and of the christian church and to be due to the polit and social 
improv which they introduc into the world and still more in 
our own centuri to the ideal of the first french revolut and the 
triumph of american independ and in a yet greater degr to the 
vast materi prosper and growth of popul in england and her 
coloni and in america it is also to be ascrib in a measur to the 
greater studi of the philosophi of histori the optimist tempera of 
some great writer ha assist the creation of it while the opposit 
charact ha led a few to regard the futur of the world a dark 
the spectat of all time and of all exist see more of the 
increa purpo which through the age ran than formerli but to the 
inhabit of a small state of hella the vision wa necessarili limit 
like the valley in which he dwelt there wa no remot past on which hi 
eye could rest nor ani futur from which the veil wa partli lift up 
by the analog of histori the narrow of view which to ourselv 
appear so singular wa to him natur if not unavoid 

5 for the relat of the republ to the statesman and the law and 
the two other work of plato which directli treat of polit see the 
introduct to the two latter a few gener point of comparison may 
be touch upon in thi place 

and first of the law 

1 the republ though probabl written at interv yet speak 
gener and judg by the indic of thought and style may be 
reason ascrib to the middl period of plato s life the law are 
certainli the work of hi declin year and some portion of them at 
ani rate seem to have been written in extrem old age 

2 the republ is full of hope and aspir the law bear the stamp 
of failur and disappoint the one is a finish work which receiv 
the last touch of the author the other is imperfectli execut and 
appar unfinish the one ha the grace and beauti of youth the 
other ha lost the poetic form but ha more of the sever and 
knowledg of life which is characterist of old age 

3 the most conspicu defect of the law is the failur of dramat 
power wherea the republ is full of strike contrast of idea and 
opposit of charact 

4 the law may be said to have more the natur of a sermon 
the republ of a poem the one is more religi the other more 
intellectu 

5 mani theori of plato such a the doctrin of idea the 
govern of the world by philosoph are not found in the law 
the immort of the soul is first mention in xii the person of 
socrat ha altogeth disappear the commun of woman and child 
is renounc the institut of common or public meal for woman law 
is for the first time introduc ar pol 

6 there remain in the law the old enmiti to the poet who are 
iron salut in high flown term and at the same time are 
peremptorili order out of the citi if they are not will to submit 
their poem to the censorship of the magistr rep 

7 though the work is in most respect inferior there are a few 
passag in the law such a the honour due to the soul the evil 
of licenti or unnatur love the whole of book x religion the 
dishonesti of retail trade and bequest which come more home to u 
and contain more of what may be term the modern element in plato than 
almost anyth in the republ 

the relat of the two work to one anoth is veri well given 

1 by aristotl in the polit from the side of the law 

the same or nearli the same object appli to plato s later work 
the law and therefor we had better examin briefli the constitut 
which is therein describ in the republ socrat ha definit 
settl in all a few question onli such a the commun of woman and 
child the commun of properti and the constitut of the state 
the popul is divid into two class one of husbandman and 
the other of warrior from thi latter is taken a third class of 
counsellor and ruler of the state but socrat ha not determin 
whether the husbandman and artist are to have a share in the 
govern and whether they too are to carri arm and share in militari 
servic or not he certainli think that the woman ought to share in the 
educ of the guardian and to fight by their side the remaind of 
the work is fill up with digress foreign to the main subject and 
with discu about the educ of the guardian in the law there 
is hardli anyth but law not much is said about the constitut 
thi which he had intend to make more of the ordinari type he 
gradual bring round to the other or ideal form for with the 
except of the commun of woman and properti he suppo everyth 
to be the same in both state there is to be the same educ the 
citizen of both are to live free from servil occup and there 
are to be common meal in both the onli differ is that in the law 
the common meal are extend to woman and the warrior number about 
5000 but in the republ onli 1000 

2 by plato in the law book v from the side of the republ 

the first and highest form of the state and of the govern and of 
the law is that in which there prevail most wide the ancient say 
that friend have all thing in common whether there is now or ever 
will be thi communion of woman and child and of properti in which 
the privat and individu is altogeth banish from life and thing 
which are by natur privat such a eye and ear and hand have 
becom common and all men express prai and blame and feel joy 
and sorrow on the same occa and the law unit the citi to the 
utmost whether all thi is possibl or not i say that no man act 
upon ani other principl will ever constitut a state more exalt in 
virtu or truer or better than thi such a state whether inhabit 
by god or son of god will make them bless who dwell therein and 
therefor to thi we are to look for the pattern of the state and to 
cling to thi and a far a possibl to seek for one which is like 
thi the state which we have now in hand when creat will be nearest 
to immort and uniti in the next degr and after that by the 
grace of god we will complet the third one and we will begin by 
speak of the natur and origin of the second 

the compar short work call the statesman or politicu in it 
style and manner is more akin to the law while in it ideal 
it rather resembl the republ a far a we can judg by variou 
indic of languag and thought it must be later than the one and 
of cour earlier than the other in both the republ and statesman a 
close connect is maintain between polit and dialect in the 
statesman enquiri into the principl of method are intersp with 
discu about polit the compar advantag of the rule of 
law and of a person are consid and the deci given in favour of 
a person arist pol but much may be said on the other side nor is 
the opposit necessari for a person may rule by law and law may 
be so appli a to be the live voic of the legisl a in the 
republ there is a myth describ howev not a futur but a 
former exist of mankind the question is ask whether the state 
of innoc which is describ in the myth or a state like our own 
which po art and scienc and distinguish good from evil is 
the prefer condit of man to thi question of the compar 
happi of civil and primit life which wa so often discu 
in the last centuri and in our own no answer is given the statesman 
though le perfect in style than the republ and of far le rang 
may justli be regard a one of the greatest of plato s dialogu 

6 other a well a plato have chosen an ideal republ to be the 
vehicl of thought which they could not definit express or which 
went beyond their own age the classic write which approach most 
nearli to the republ of plato is the de republica of cicero but 
neither in thi nor in ani other of hi dialogu doe he rival the 
art of plato the manner are clumsi and inferior the hand of the 
rhetorician is appar at everi turn yet nobl sentiment are 
constantli recur the true note of roman patriot we roman are 
a great peopl resound through the whole work like socrat cicero 
turn away from the phenomenon of the heaven to civil and polit 
life he would rather not discu the two sun of which all rome wa 
talk when he can conver about the two nation in one which had 
divid rome ever sinc the day of the gracchi like socrat again 
speak in the person of scipio he is afraid lest he should assum 
too much the charact of a teacher rather than of an equal who is 
discu among friend the two side of a question he would confin 
the term king or state to the rule of reason and justic and he will 
not conc that titl either to a democraci or to a monarchi but under 
the rule of reason and justic he is will to includ the natur 
superior rule over the natur inferior which he compar to the soul 
rule over the bodi he prefer a mixtur of form of govern to ani 
singl one the two portrait of the just and the unjust which occur in 
the second book of the republ are transfer to the state philu 
one of the interlocutor maintain against hi will the necess 
of injust a a principl of govern while the other laeliu 
support the opposit thesi hi view of languag and number are 
deriv from plato like him he denounc the drama he also declar 
that if hi life were to be twice a long he would have no time to read 
the lyric poet the pictur of democraci is translat by him word for 
word though he had hardli shown himself abl to carri the jest of 
plato he convert into a state sentenc the humor fanci about the 
anim who are so imbu with the spirit of democraci that they make 
the passer by get out of their way hi descript of the tyrant is 
imit from plato but is far inferior the second book is histor 
and claim for the roman constitut which is to him the ideal a 
foundat of fact such a plato probabl intend to have given to the 
republ in the critia hi most remark imit of plato is the 
adapt of the vision of er which is convert by cicero into the 
somnium scipioni he ha roman the myth of the republ ad 
an argument for the immort of the soul taken from the phaedru 
and some other touch deriv from the phaedo and the timaeu though a 
beauti tale and contain splendid passag the somnium scipioni 
is veri inferior to the vision of er it is onli a dream and hardli 
allow the reader to suppo that the writer belief in hi own 
creation whether hi dialogu were frame on the model of the lost 
dialogu of aristotl a he himself tell u or of plato to which 
they bear mani superfici resembl he is still the roman orat 
he is not conver but make speech and is never abl to mould 
the intract latin to the grace and ea of the greek platon 
dialogu but if he is defect in form much more is he inferior to 
the greek in matter he nowher in hi philosoph write leaf 
upon our mind the impress of an origin thinker 

plato s republ ha been said to be a church and not a state and such 
an ideal of a citi in the heaven ha alway hover over the christian 
world and is embodi in st augustin s de civit dei which is 
suggest by the decay and fall of the roman empir much in the same 
manner in which we may imagin the republ of plato to have been 
influenc by the declin of greek polit in the writer s own age the 
differ is that in the time of plato the degeneraci though certain 
wa gradual and insen wherea the take of rome by the goth 
stir like an earthquak the age of st augustin men were inclin 
to believ that the overthrow of the citi wa to be ascrib to the 
anger felt by the old roman deiti at the neglect of their worship st 
augustin maintain the opposit thesi he argu that the destruct 
of the roman empir is due not to the rise of christian but to 
the vice of pagan he wander over roman histori and over greek 
philosophi and mytholog and find everywh crime impieti and 
falsehood he compar the worst part of the gentil religion with 
the best element of the faith of christ he show noth of the spirit 
which led other of the earli christian father to recogn in the 
write of the greek philosoph the power of the divin truth he 
trace the parallel of the kingdom of god that is the histori of the 
jew contain in their scriptur and of the kingdom of the world 
which are found in gentil writer and pursu them both into an ideal 
futur it need hardli be remark that hi use both of greek and 
of roman historian and of the sacr write of the jew is wholli 
uncrit the heathen mytholog the sybillin oracl the myth 
of plato the dream of neo platonist are equal regard by him a 
matter of fact he must be acknowledg to be a strictli polem or 
controversi writer who make the best of everyth on one side and 
the worst of everyth on the other he ha no sympathi with the old 
roman life a plato ha with greek life nor ha he ani idea of the 
ecclesiast kingdom which wa to ari out of the ruin of the roman 
empir he is not blind to the defect of the christian church and 
look forward to a time when christian and pagan shall be alik brought 
befor the judgment seat and the true citi of god shall appear the 
work of st augustin is a curiou repertori of antiquarian learn and 
quotat deepli penetr with christian ethic but show littl 
power of reason and a slender knowledg of the greek literatur 
and languag he wa a great geniu and a nobl charact yet hardli 
capabl of feel or understand anyth extern to hi own 
theolog of all the ancient philosoph he is most attract by plato 
though he is veri slightli acquaint with hi write he is inclin 
to believ that the idea of creation in the timaeu is deriv from the 
narr in genesi and he is strang taken with the coincid 
of plato s say that the philosoph is the lover of god and 
the word of the book of exodu in which god reveal himself to mose 
exod he dwell at length on miracl perform in hi own day of 
which the evid is regard by him a irresist he speak in a 
veri interest manner of the beauti and util of natur and of the 
human frame which he conceiv to afford a foretast of the heavenli 
state and of the resurrect of the bodi the book is not realli what 
to most person the titl of it would impli and belong to an age which 
ha pa away but it contain mani fine passag and thought which 
are for all time 

the short treati de monarchia of dant is by far the most remark 
of mediaev ideal and bear the impress of the great geniu in whom 
itali and the middl age are so vividli reflect it is the vision of 
an univ empir which is suppo to be the natur and necessari 
govern of the world have a divin author distinct from the 
papaci yet coexten with it it is not the ghost of the dead roman 
empir sit crown upon the grave thereof but the legitim heir 
and successor of it justifi by the ancient virtu of the roman and 
the benef of their rule their right to be the governor of the 
world is also confirm by the testimoni of miracl and acknowledg 
by st paul when he appeal to caesar and even more emphat by 
christ himself who could not have made aton for the sin of men 
if he had not been condemn by a divin author tribun the 
necess for the establish of an univ empir is prove partli 
by a priori argument such a the uniti of god and the uniti of the 
famili or nation partli by perver of scriptur and histori by 
fal analog of natur by misappli quotat from the classic 
and by odd scrap and commonplac of logic show a familiar but by 
no mean exact knowledg of aristotl of plato there is none but 
a more convinc argument still is the miser state of the world 
which he touchingli describ he see no hope of happi or peac 
for mankind until all nation of the earth are comprehend in a singl 
empir the whole treati show how deepli the idea of the roman empir 
wa fix in the mind of hi contemporari not much argument wa 
need to maintain the truth of a theori which to hi own contemporari 
seem so natur and congeni he speak or rather preach from the 
point of view not of the ecclesiast but of the layman although a 
a good cathol he is will to acknowledg that in certain respect 
the empir must submit to the church the begin and end of all hi 
nobl reflect and of hi argument good and bad is the aspir 
that in thi littl plot of earth belong to mortal man life may pa 
in freedom and peac so inextr is hi vision of the futur bound 
up with the belief and circumst of hi own age 

the utopia of sir thoma more is a surpri monument of hi geniu 
and show a reach of thought far beyond hi contemporari the book wa 
written by him at the age of about 34 or 35 and is full of the gener 
sentiment of youth he bring the light of plato to bear upon the 
miser state of hi own countri live not long after the war of 
the rose and in the dreg of the cathol church in england he is 
indign at the corrupt of the clergi at the luxuri of the nobil 
and gentri at the suffer of the poor at the calam cau by 
war to the eye of more the whole world wa in dissolut and decay 
and side by side with the miseri and oppress which he ha describ 
in the first book of the utopia he place in the second book the ideal 
state which by the help of plato he had construct the time were full 
of stir and intellectu interest the distant murmur of the reform 
wa begin to be heard to mind like more s greek literatur wa 
a revel there had arisen an art of interpret and the new 
testament wa begin to be understood a it had never been befor 
and ha not often been sinc in it natur sen the life there 
depict appear to him wholli unlik that of christian commonwealth 
in which he saw noth but a certain conspiraci of rich men procur 
their own commod under the name and titl of the commonwealth 
he thought that christ like plato institut all thing common for 
which reason he tell u the citizen of utopia were the more will 
to receiv hi doctrin howbeit i think thi wa no small help and 
further in the matter that they heard u say that christ institut 
among hi all thing common and that the same commun doth yet 
remain in the rightest christian commun utopia the commun 
of properti is a fix idea with him though he is awar of the 
argument which may be urg on the other side these thing i say 
when i consid with myself i hold well with plato and do noth 
marvel that he would make no law for them that refu those law 
wherebi all men should have and enjoy equal portion of rich and 
commod for the wise men did easili fores thi to be the one and 
onli way to the wealth of a commun if equal of all thing should 
be brought in and establish utopia we wonder how in the reign of 
henri viii though veil in anoth languag and publish in a foreign 
countri such specul could have been endur 

he is gift with far greater dramat invent than ani one who 
succeed him with the except of swift in the art of feign he is 
a worthi discipl of plato like him start from a small portion 
of fact he found hi tale with admir skill on a few line in the 
latin narr of the voyag of amerigo vespucci he is veri preci 
about date and fact and ha the power of make u believ that the 
narrat of the tale must have been an eyewit we are fairli puzzl 
by hi manner of mix up real and imaginari person hi boy john 
clement and peter gile citizen of antwerp with whom he disput 
about the preci word which are suppo to have been use by the 
imaginari portugu travel raphael hythloday i have the more 
cau say hythloday to fear that my word shall not be believ 
for that i know how difficultli and hardli i myself would have believ 
anoth man tell the same if i had not myself seen it with mine own 
eye or again if you had been with me in utopia and had present 
seen their fashion and law a i did which live there five year and 
more and would never have come thenc but onli to make the new land 
known here etc more greatli regret that he forgot to ask hythloday 
in what part of the world utopia is situat he would have spent no 
small sum of money rather than it should have escap him and he beg 
peter gile to see hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to the 
question after thi we are not surpri to hear that a professor of 
divin perhap a late famou vicar of croydon in surrey a the 
translat think is desir of be sent thither a a missionari by 
the high bishop yea and that he may himself be made bishop of utopia 
noth doubt that he must obtain thi bishopr with suit and he 
counteth that a godli suit which proceedeth not of the desir of honour 
or lucr but onli of a godli zeal the design may have fail through 
the disappear of hythloday concern whom we have veri uncertain 
news after hi departur there is no doubt howev that he had told 
more and gile the exact situat of the island but unfortun at 
the same moment more s attent a he is remind in a letter from 
gile wa drawn off by a servant and one of the compani from a cold 
caught on shipboard cough so loud a to prevent gile from hear 
and the secret ha perish with him to thi day the place of utopia 
remain unknown 

the word of phaedru o socrat you can easili invent egyptian or 
anyth are recal to our mind a we read thi lifelik fiction 
yet the greater merit of the work is not the admir art but the 
origin of thought more is a free a plato from the prejud 
of hi age and far more toler the utopian do not allow him 
who belief not in the immort of the soul to share in the 
administr of the state law howbeit they put him to no 
punish becau they be persuad that it is in no man s power to 
believ what he list and no man is to be blame for reason in 
support of hi own religion one of our compani in my presenc wa 
sharpli punish he a soon a he wa bapti began against our 
will with more earnest affect than wisdom to reason of christ s 
religion and began to wax so hot in hi matter that he did not onli 
prefer our religion befor all other but also did despi and condemn 
all other call them profan and the follow of them wick and 
devilish and the child of everlast damnat when he had thu 
long reason the matter they laid hold on him accu him and 
condemn him into exil not a a despi of religion but a a 
sediti person and a raiser up of dissen among the peopl 
in the public servic no prayer be use but such a everi man 
may boldli pronounc without give offenc to ani sect he say 
significantli there be that give worship to a man that wa onc of 
excel virtu or of famou glori not onli a god but also the 
chiefest and highest god but the most and the wisest part reject 
all these believ that there is a certain godli power unknown far 
abov the capac and reach of man s wit disper throughout all the 
world not in big but in virtu and power him they call the father 
of all to him alon they attribut the begin the increa the 
proceed the chang and the end of all thing neither give they 
ani divin honour to ani other than him so far wa more from share 
the popular belief of hi time yet at the end he remind u that he 
doe not in all respect agr with the custom and opinion of the 
utopian which he describ and we should let him have the benefit of 
thi save clau and not rude withdraw the veil behind which he ha 
been plea to conceal himself 

nor is he le in advanc of popular opinion in hi polit and moral 
specul he would like to bring militari glori into contempt he 
would set all sort of idl peopl to profit occup includ 
in the same class priest woman nobleman gentleman and sturdi and 
valiant beggar that the labour of all may be reduc to six hour a 
day hi dislik of capit punish and plan for the reform of 
offend hi detest of priest and lawyer compar hi satir 
observ they the utopian have priest of exceed holi 
and therefor veri few hi remark that although everi one may hear 
of raven dog and wolf and cruel man eater it is not easi to find 
state that are well and wise govern are curiou at varianc 
with the notion of hi age and ind with hi own life there are mani 
point in which he show a modern feel and a prophet insight like 
plato he is a sanitari reform he maintain that civil state 
have a right to the soil of wast countri he is inclin to the 
opinion which place happi in virtuou pleasur but herein a he 
think not disagr from those other philosoph who defin virtu 
to be a life accord to natur he extend the idea of happi so a 
to includ the happi of other and he argu ingeni all men 
agr that we ought to make other happi but if other how much more 
ourselv and still he think that there may be a more excel way 
but to thi no man s reason can attain unless heaven should inspir him 
with a higher truth hi ceremoni befor marriag hi human propo 
that war should be carri on by assassin the leader of the enemi 
may be compar to some of the paradox of plato he ha a charm 
fanci like the affin of greek and barbarian in the timaeu that 
the utopian learnt the languag of the greek with the more readi 
becau they were origin of the same race with them he is 
penetr with the spirit of plato and quot or adapt mani thought 
both from the republ and from the timaeu he prefer public duti to 
privat and is somewhat impati of the importun of relat hi 
citizen have no silver or gold of their own but are readi enough to 
pay them to their mercenari there is noth of which he is more 
contemptu than the love of money gold is use for fetter of 
crimin and diamond and pearl for child s necklac when the 
ambassador came array in gold and peacock feather to the eye of 
all the utopian except veri few which had been in other countri for 
some reason cau all that gorgeou of apparel seem shame 
and reproach in so much that they most rever salut the 
vilest and most abject of them for lord pa over the ambassador 
themselv without ani honour judg them by their wear of golden 
chain to be bondman you should have seen child also that had cast 
away their pearl and preciou stone when they saw the like stick 
upon the ambassador cap dig and push their mother under the side 
say thu to them look though he were a littl child still but 
the mother yea and that also in good earnest peac son saith she 
i think he be some of the ambassador fool 

like plato he is full of satir reflect on govern and 
princ on the state of the world and of knowledg the hero of hi 
discour hythloday is veri unwil to becom a minist of state 
consid that he would lose hi independ and hi advic would 
never be heed compar an exquisit passag of which the conclu 
is a follow and verili it is natur given suppress and 
end he ridicul the new logic of hi time the utopian could 
never be made to understand the doctrin of second intent for they 
have not devi one of all those rule of restrict amplif 
and supposit veri wittili invent in the small logic which 
here our child in everi place do learn furthermor they were never 
yet abl to find out the second intent insomuch that none of them 
all could ever see man himself in common a they call him though he be 
a you know bigger than wa ever ani giant yea and point to of u 
even with our finger he is veri sever on the sport of the gentri 
the utopian count hunt the lowest the vilest and the most abject 
part of butcheri he quot the word of the republ in which the 
philosoph is describ stand out of the way under a wall until the 
drive storm of sleet and rain be overpast which admit of a singular 
applic to more s own fate although write twenti year befor 
about the year 1514 he can hardli be suppo to have foreseen thi 
there is no touch of satir which strike deeper than hi quiet remark 
that the greater part of the precept of christ are more at varianc 
with the life of ordinari christian than the discour of utopia and 
yet the most part of them is more dissid from the manner of the 
world now a day than my commun wa but preacher sli and 
wili men follow your counsel a i suppo becau they saw men 
evil will to frame their manner to christ s rule they have wrest 
and wri hi doctrin and like a rule of lead have appli it to 
men s manner that by some mean at the least way they might agr 
togeth 

the new atlanti is onli a fragment and far inferior in merit to the 
utopia the work is full of ingenu but want in creativ fanci 
and by no mean impress the reader with a sen of credibl in 
some place lord bacon is characterist differ from sir thoma 
more a for exampl in the extern state which he attribut to the 
governor of solomon s hou whose dress he minut describ while to 
sir thoma more such trap appear simpl ridicul yet after thi 
programm of dress bacon add the beauti trait that he had a look 
a though he piti men sever thing are borrow by him from the 
timaeu but he ha injur the uniti of style by ad thought and 
passag which are taken from the hebrew scriptur 

the citi of the sun written by campanella 1568 1639 a dominican 
friar sever year after the new atlanti of bacon ha mani 
resembl to the republ of plato the citizen have wife and 
child in common their marriag are of the same temporari sort and 
are arrang by the magistr from time to time they do not howev 
adopt hi system of lot but bring togeth the best natur male and 
femal accord to philosoph rule the infant until two year 
of age are brought up by their mother in public templ and sinc 
individu for the most part educ their child badli at the 
begin of their third year they are commit to the care of the 
state and are taught at first not out of book but from paint of 
all kind which are emblazon on the wall of the citi the citi ha 
six interior circuit of wall and an outer wall which is the 
seventh on thi outer wall are paint the figur of legisl and 
philosoph and on each of the interior wall the symbol or form 
of some one of the scienc are delin the woman are for the most 
part train like the men in warlik and other exerci but they 
have two special occup of their own after a battl they and the 
boy sooth and reliev the wound warrior also they encourag them 
with embrac and pleasant word some element of the christian or 
cathol religion are preserv among them the life of the apostl is 
greatli admir by thi peopl becau they had all thing in common 
and the short prayer which jesu christ taught men is use in their 
worship it is a duti of the chief magistr to pardon sin and 
therefor the whole peopl make secret confess of them to the 
magistr and they to their chief who is a sort of rector 
metaphysicu and by thi mean he is well inform of all that is go 
on in the mind of men after confess absolut is grant to 
the citizen collect but no one is mention by name there 
also exist among them a practic of perpetu prayer perform by 
a success of priest who chang everi hour their religion is 
a worship of god in triniti that is of wisdom love and power 
but without ani distinct of person they behold in the sun the 
reflect of hi glori mere graven imag they reject refu to 
fall under the tyranni of idolatri 

mani detail are given about their custom of eat and drink about 
their mode of dress their employ their war campanella look 
forward to a new mode of educ which is to be a studi of natur 
and not of aristotl he would not have hi citizen wast their time 
in the consid of what he call the dead sign of thing he 
remark that he who know one scienc onli doe not realli know that 
one ani more than the rest and insist strongli on the necess of a 
varieti of knowledg more scholar are turn out in the citi of the 
sun in one year than by contemporari method in ten or fifteen he 
evid belief like bacon that henceforward natur scienc will 
play a great part in educ a hope which seem hardli to have 
been realiz either in our own or in ani former age at ani rate the 
fulfil of it ha been long defer 

there is a good deal of ingenu and even origin in thi work and 
a most enlighten spirit pervad it but it ha littl or no charm 
of style and fall veri far short of the new atlanti of bacon 
and still more of the utopia of sir thoma more it is full of 
inconsist and though borrow from plato show but a superfici 
acquaint with hi write it is a work such a one might expect 
to have been written by a philosoph and man of geniu who wa also a 
friar and who had spent twenti seven year of hi life in a prison of 
the inquisit the most interest featur of the book common to 
plato and sir thoma more is the deep feel which is shown by the 
writer of the miseri and ignor prevail among the lower class 
in hi own time campanella take note of aristotl s answer to plato s 
commun of properti that in a societi where all thing are common no 
individu would have ani motiv to work arist pol he repli that 
hi citizen be happi and content in themselv they are requir 
to work onli four hour a day will have greater regard for their 
fellow than exist among men at present he think like plato that if 
he abolish privat feel and interest a great public feel will 
take their place 

other write on ideal state such a the oceana of harrington in 
which the lord archon mean cromwel is describ not a he wa 
but a he ought to have been or the argeni of barclay which is an 
histor allegori of hi own time are too unlik plato to be worth 
mention more interest than either of these and far more platon 
in style and thought is sir john eliot s monarchi of man in which 
the prison of the tower no longer abl to be a politician in the 
land of hi birth turn away from polit to view that other citi 
which is within him and find on the veri threshold of the grave that 
the secret of human happi is the masteri of self the chang of 
govern in the time of the english commonwealth set men think 
about first principl and gave rise to mani work of thi class the 
great origin geniu of swift owe noth to plato nor is there 
ani trace in the conver or in the work of dr johnson of ani 
acquaint with hi write he probabl would have refut plato 
without read him in the same fashion in which he suppo himself to 
have refut bishop berkeley s theori of the non exist of matter 
if we except the so call english platonist or rather neo platonist 
who never understood their master and the write of coleridg 
who wa to some extent a kindr spirit plato ha left no perman 
impress on english literatur 

7 human life and conduct are affect by ideal in the same way that 
they are affect by the exampl of emin men neither the one nor 
the other are immedi applic to practic but there is a virtu 
flow from them which tend to rai individu abov the common 
routin of societi or trade and to elev state abov the mere 
interest of commerc or the necess of self defenc like the 
ideal of art they are partli frame by the omiss of particular 
they requir to be view at a certain distanc and are apt to fade 
away if we attempt to approach them they gain an imaginari distinct 
when embodi in a state or in a system of philosophi but they still 
remain the vision of a world unreal more strike and obviou to 
the ordinari mind are the exampl of great men who have serv their 
own gener and are rememb in anoth even in our own famili 
circl there may have been some one a woman or even a child in 
whose face ha shone forth a good more than human the ideal then 
approach nearer to u and we fondli cling to it the ideal of the 
past whether of our own past life or of former state of societi ha 
a singular fascin for the mind of mani too late we learn that 
such ideal cannot be recal though the recollect of them may 
have a human influenc on other time but the abstract of 
philosophi are to most person cold and vacant they give light without 
warmth they are like the full moon in the heaven when there are no 
star appear men cannot live by thought alon the world of sen is 
alway break in upon them they are for the most part confin to a 
corner of earth and see but a littl way beyond their own home or place 
of abod they do not lift up their eye to the hill they are not 
awak when the dawn appear but in plato we have reach a height from 
which a man may look into the distanc and behold the futur of the 
world and of philosophi the ideal of the state and of the life of 
the philosoph the ideal of an educ continu through life and 
extend equal to both sex the ideal of the uniti and correl 
of knowledg the faith in good and immort are the vacant form of 
light on which plato is seek to fix the eye of mankind 

8 two other ideal which never appear abov the horizon in greek 
philosophi float befor the mind of men in our own day one seen more 
clearli than formerli a though each year and each gener brought 
u nearer to some great chang the other almost in the same degr 
retir from view behind the law of natur a if oppress by them 
but still remain a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the 
heart of man the first ideal is the futur of the human race in thi 
world the second the futur of the individu in anoth the first is 
the more perfect realiz of our own present life the second 
the abneg of it the one limit by experi the other 
transcend it both of them have been and are power motif of 
action there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all earthli 
interest the hope of a futur for the human race at first sight seem 
to be the more disinterest the hope of individu exist the more 
egotist of the two motif but when men have learn to resolv 
their hope of a futur either for themselv or for the world into the 
will of god not my will but thine the differ between them fall 
away and they may be allow to make either of them the basi of their 
life accord to their own individu charact or tempera there 
is a much faith in the will to work for an unseen futur in thi 
world a in anoth neither is it inconceiv that some rare natur 
may feel hi duti to anoth gener or to anoth centuri almost 
a strongli a to hi own or that live alway in the presenc of god 
he may realiz anoth world a vividli a he doe thi 

the greatest of all ideal may or rather must be conceiv by u under 
similitud deriv from human qualiti although sometim like the 
jewish prophet we may dash away these figur of speech and describ 
the natur of god onli in neg these again by degr acquir a 
posit mean it would be well if when medit on the higher 
truth either of philosophi or religion we sometim substitut one 
form of express for anoth lest through the necess of languag 
we should becom the slave of mere word 

there is a third ideal not the same but akin to these which ha a 
place in the home and heart of everi believ in the religion of christ 
and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth 
the divin man the son of man the saviour of mankind who is the 
first born and head of the whole famili in heaven and earth in whom 
the divin and human that which is without and that which is within the 
rang of our earthli faculti are indissolubl unit neither is thi 
divin form of good wholli separ from the ideal of the christian 
church which is said in the new testament to be hi bodi or at 
varianc with those other imag of good which plato set befor u we 
see him in a figur onli and of figur of speech we select but a few 
and those the simplest to be the express of him we behold him in 
a pictur but he is not there we gather up the fragment of hi 
discour but neither do they repr him a he truli wa hi 
dwell is neither in heaven nor earth but in the heart of man 
thi is that imag which plato saw dimli in the distanc which when 
exist among men he call in the languag of homer the like 
of god the like of a natur which in all age men have felt to be 
greater and better than themselv and which in endless form whether 
deriv from scriptur or natur from the wit of histori or from 
the human heart regard a a person or not a a person with or 
without part or passion exist in space or not in space is and 
will alway continu to be to mankind the idea of good

person of the dialogu 

socrat who is the narrat 

glaucon 

adeimantu 

polemarchu 

cephalu 

thrasymachu 

cleitophon 

and other who are mute auditor 

the scene is laid in the hou of cephalu at the piraeu and the whole 
dialogu is narrat by socrat the day after it actual took place to 
timaeu hermocr critia and a nameless person who are introduc 
in the timaeu 




book i 

i went down yesterday to the piraeu with glaucon the son of ariston 
that i might offer up my prayer to the goddess bendi the thracian 
artemi and also becau i want to see in what manner they would 
celebr the festiv which wa a new thing i wa delight with the 
process of the inhabit but that of the thracian wa equal 
if not more beauti when we had finish our prayer and view the 
spectacl we turn in the direct of the citi and at that instant 
polemarchu the son of cephalu chanc to catch sight of u from a 
distanc a we were start on our way home and told hi servant to 
run and bid u wait for him the servant took hold of me by the cloak 
behind and said polemarchu desir you to wait 

i turn round and ask him where hi master wa 

there he is said the youth come after you if you will onli wait 

certainli we will said glaucon and in a few minut polemarchu 
appear and with him adeimantu glaucon s brother niceratu the son 
of nicia and sever other who had been at the process 

polemarchu said to me i perceiv socrat that you and your 
companion are alreadi on your way to the citi 

you are not far wrong i said 

but do you see he rejoin how mani we are 

of cour 

and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have to remain 
where you are 

may there not be the altern i said that we may persuad you to 
let u go 

but can you persuad u if we refu to listen to you he said 

certainli not repli glaucon 

then we are not go to listen of that you may be assur 

adeimantu ad ha no one told you of the torch race on horseback in 
honour of the goddess which will take place in the even 

with hor i repli that is a novelti will horseman carri torch 
and pa them one to anoth dure the race 

ye said polemarchu and not onli so but a festiv will be 
celebr at night which you certainli ought to see let u rise soon 
after supper and see thi festiv there will be a gather of young 
men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not be perver 

glaucon said i suppo sinc you insist that we must 

veri good i repli 

accordingli we went with polemarchu to hi hou and there we found 
hi brother lysia and euthydemu and with them thrasymachu the 
chalcedonian charmantid the paeanian and cleitophon the son of 
aristonymu there too wa cephalu the father of polemarchu whom i 
had not seen for a long time and i thought him veri much age he wa 
seat on a cushion chair and had a garland on hi head for he had 
been sacrif in the court and there were some other chair in the 
room arrang in a semicircl upon which we sat down by him he salut 
me eagerli and then he said 

you don t come to see me socrat a often a you ought if i were 
still abl to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but 
at my age i can hardli get to the citi and therefor you should come 
often to the piraeu for let me tell you that the more the pleasur 
of the bodi fade away the greater to me is the pleasur and charm 
of conver do not then deni my request but make our hou your 
resort and keep compani with these young men we are old friend and 
you will be quit at home with u 

i repli there is noth which for my part i like better cephalu 
than conver with age men for i regard them a travel who 
have gone a journey which i too may have to go and of whom i ought to 
enquir whether the way is smooth and easi or rug and difficult 
and thi is a question which i should like to ask of you who have 
arriv at that time which the poet call the threshold of old age is 
life harder toward the end or what report do you give of it 

i will tell you socrat he said what my own feel is men of my 
age flock togeth we are bird of a feather a the old proverb say 
and at our meet the tale of my acquaint commonli is i cannot 
eat i cannot drink the pleasur of youth and love are fled away 
there wa a good time onc but now that is gone and life is no longer 
life some complain of the slight which are put upon them by relat 
and they will tell you sadli of how mani evil their old age is the 
cau but to me socrat these complain seem to blame that which 
is not realli in fault for if old age were the cau i too be old 
and everi other old man would have felt a they do but thi is not 
my own experi nor that of other whom i have known how well i 
rememb the age poet sophocl when in answer to the question how 
doe love suit with age sophocl are you still the man you were 
peac he repli most gladli have i escap the thing of which you 
speak i feel a if i had escap from a mad and furiou master hi 
word have often occur to my mind sinc and they seem a good to 
me now a at the time when he utter them for certainli old age ha 
a great sen of calm and freedom when the passion relax their hold 
then a sophocl say we are freed from the grasp not of one mad 
master onli but of mani the truth is socrat that these regret 
and also the complaint about relat are to be attribut to the 
same cau which is not old age but men s charact and temper for 
he who is of a calm and happi natur will hardli feel the pressur of 
age but to him who is of an opposit disposit youth and age are 
equal a burden 

i listen in admir and want to draw him out that he might go 
on ye cephalu i said but i rather suspect that peopl in gener 
are not convinc by you when you speak thu they think that old 
age sit lightli upon you not becau of your happi disposit but 
becau you are rich and wealth is well known to be a great comfort 

you are right he repli they are not convinc and there is 
someth in what they say not howev so much a they imagin i 
might answer them a themistocl answer the seriphian who wa abu 
him and say that he wa famou not for hi own merit but becau he 
wa an athenian if you had been a nativ of my countri or i of your 
neither of u would have been famou and to those who are not rich and 
are impati of old age the same repli may be made for to the good 
poor man old age cannot be a light burden nor can a bad rich man ever 
have peac with himself 

may i ask cephalu whether your fortun wa for the most part 
inherit or acquir by you 

acquir socrat do you want to know how much i acquir in the art 
of make money i have been midway between my father and grandfath 
for my grandfath whose name i bear doubl and trebl the valu of 
hi patrimoni that which he inherit be much what i po now 
but my father lysania reduc the properti below what it is at present 
and i shall be satisfi if i leav to these my son not le but a 
littl more than i receiv 

that wa whi i ask you the question i repli becau i see that you 
are indiff about money which is a characterist rather of those 
who have inherit their fortun than of those who have acquir them 
the maker of fortun have a second love of money a a creation of 
their own resembl the affect of author for their own poem or 
of parent for their child besid that natur love of it for the 
sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men and henc 
they are veri bad compani for they can talk about noth but the 
prai of wealth 

that is true he said 

ye that is veri true but may i ask anoth question what do you 
consid to be the greatest bless which you have reap from your 
wealth 

one he said of which i could not expect easili to convinc other 
for let me tell you socrat that when a man think himself to be near 
death fear and care enter into hi mind which he never had befor 
the tale of a world below and the punish which is exact there 
of deed done here were onc a laugh matter to him but now he 
is torment with the thought that they may be true either from the 
weak of age or becau he is now draw nearer to that other 
place he ha a clearer view of these thing suspicion and alarm 
crowd thickli upon him and he begin to reflect and consid what 
wrong he ha done to other and when he find that the sum of hi 
transgress is great he will mani a time like a child start up in hi 
sleep for fear and he is fill with dark forebod but to him who 
is consciou of no sin sweet hope a pindar charmingli say is the 
kind nur of hi age 

hope he say cherish the soul of him who life in justic 
and holi and is the nur of hi age and the companion of hi 
journey hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 

how admir are hi word and the great bless of rich i do not 
say to everi man but to a good man is that he ha had no occa to 
deceiv or to defraud other either intent or unint 
and when he depart to the world below he is not in ani apprehen 
about offer due to the god or debt which he owe to men now to 
thi peac of mind the poss of wealth greatli contribut and 
therefor i say that set one thing against anoth of the mani 
advantag which wealth ha to give to a man of sen thi is in my 
opinion the greatest 

well said cephalu i repli but a concern justic what is 
it to speak the truth and to pay your debt no more than thi and 
even to thi are there not except suppo that a friend when in hi 
right mind ha deposit arm with me and he ask for them when he is 
not in hi right mind ought i to give them back to him no one would 
say that i ought or that i should be right in do so ani more than 
they would say that i ought alway to speak the truth to one who is in 
hi condit 

you are quit right he repli 

but then i said speak the truth and pay your debt is not a 
correct definit of justic 

quit correct socrat if simonid is to be believ said 
polemarchu interpo 

i fear said cephalu that i must go now for i have to look after the 
sacrif and i hand over the argument to polemarchu and the compani 

is not polemarchu your heir i said 

to be sure he answer and went away laugh to the sacrif 

tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonid say and 
accord to you truli say about justic 

he said that the repay of a debt is just and in say so he 
appear to me to be right 

i should be sorri to doubt the word of such a wise and inspir man but 
hi mean though probabl clear to you is the rever of clear to 
me for he certainli doe not mean a we were just now say that i 
ought to return a deposit of arm or of anyth el to one who ask 
for it when he is not in hi right sen and yet a deposit cannot be 
deni to be a debt 

true 

then when the person who ask me is not in hi right mind i am by no 
mean to make the return 

certainli not 

when simonid said that the repay of a debt wa justic he did not 
mean to includ that case 

certainli not for he think that a friend ought alway to do good to a 
friend and never evil 

you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuri of 
the receiv if the two parti are friend is not the repay of a 
debt that is what you would imagin him to say 

ye 

and are enemi also to receiv what we owe to them 

to be sure he said they are to receiv what we owe them and an enemi 
a i take it owe to an enemi that which is due or proper to him that 
is to say evil 

simonid then after the manner of poet would seem to have spoken 
darkli of the natur of justic for he realli meant to say that justic 
is the give to each man what is proper to him and thi he term a 
debt 

that must have been hi mean he said 

by heaven i repli and if we ask him what due or proper thing is 
given by medicin and to whom what answer do you think that he would 
make to u 

he would sure repli that medicin give drug and meat and drink to 
human bodi 

and what due or proper thing is given by cookeri and to what 

season to food 

and what is that which justic give and to whom 

if socrat we are to be guid at all by the analog of the prece 
instanc then justic is the art which give good to friend and evil 
to enemi 

that is hi mean then 

i think so 

and who is best abl to do good to hi friend and evil to hi enemi 
in time of sick 

the physician 

or when they are on a voyag amid the peril of the sea 

the pilot 

and in what sort of action or with a view to what result is the just 
man most abl to do harm to hi enemi and good to hi friend 

in go to war against the one and in make allianc with the other 

but when a man is well my dear polemarchu there is no need of a 
physician 

no 

and he who is not on a voyag ha no need of a pilot 

no 

then in time of peac justic will be of no use 

i am veri far from think so 

you think that justic may be of use in peac a well a in war 

ye 

like husbandri for the acquisit of corn 

ye 

or like shoemak for the acquisit of shoe that is what you mean 

ye 

and what similar use or power of acquisit ha justic in time of 
peac 

in contract socrat justic is of use 

and by contract you mean partnership 

exactli 

but is the just man or the skil player a more use and better 
partner at a game of draught 

the skil player 

and in the lay of brick and stone is the just man a more use or 
better partner than the builder 

quit the rever 

then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than 
the harp player a in play the harp the harp player is certainli a 
better partner than the just man 

in a money partnership 

ye polemarchu but sure not in the use of money for you do not 
want a just man to be your counsellor in the purcha or sale of a 
hor a man who is know about hor would be better for that would 
he not 

certainli 

and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot would be 
better 

true 

then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is 
to be prefer 

when you want a deposit to be kept safe 

you mean when money is not want but allow to lie 

preci 

that is to say justic is use when money is useless 

that is the infer 

and when you want to keep a prune hook safe then justic is use to 
the individu and to the state but when you want to use it then the 
art of the vine dresser 

clearli 

and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use them you 
would say that justic is use but when you want to use them then 
the art of the soldier or of the musician 

certainli 

and so of all other thing justic is use when they are useless 
and useless when they are use 

that is the infer 

then justic is not good for much but let u consid thi further 
point is not he who can best strike a blow in a box match or in ani 
kind of fight best abl to ward off a blow 

certainli 

and he who is most skil in prevent or escap from a disea is 
best abl to creat one 

true 

and he is the best guard of a camp who is best abl to steal a march 
upon the enemi 

certainli 

then he who is a good keeper of anyth is also a good thief 

that i suppo is to be infer 

then if the just man is good at keep money he is good at steal 
it 

that is impli in the argument 

then after all the just man ha turn out to be a thief and thi is 
a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for he 
speak of autolycu the matern grandfath of odysseu who is a 
favourit of hi affirm that 

he wa excel abov all men in theft and perjuri 

and so you and homer and simonid are agr that justic is an art of 
theft to be practi howev for the good of friend and for the harm 
of enemi that wa what you were say 

no certainli not that though i do not now know what i did say but i 
still stand by the latter word 

well there is anoth question by friend and enemi do we mean those 
who are so realli or onli in seem 

sure he said a man may be expect to love those whom he think 
good and to hate those whom he think evil 

ye but do not person often err about good and evil mani who are not 
good seem to be so and conver 

that is true 

then to them the good will be enemi and the evil will be their 
friend true 

and in that case they will be right in do good to the evil and evil 
to the good 

clearli 

but the good are just and would not do an injust 

true 

then accord to your argument it is just to injur those who do no 
wrong 

nay socrat the doctrin is immor 

then i suppo that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the 
unjust 

i like that better 

but see the consequ mani a man who is ignor of human natur 
ha friend who are bad friend and in that case he ought to do harm to 
them and he ha good enemi whom he ought to benefit but if so we 
shall be say the veri opposit of that which we affirm to be the 
mean of simonid 

veri true he said and i think that we had better correct an error 
into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the word friend and 
enemi 

what wa the error polemarchu i ask 

we assum that he is a friend who seem to be or who is thought good 

and how is the error to be correct 

we should rather say that he is a friend who is a well a seem good 
and that he who seem onli and is not good onli seem to be and is not 
a friend and of an enemi the same may be said 

you would argu that the good are our friend and the bad our enemi 

ye 

and instead of say simpli a we did at first that it is just to do 
good to our friend and harm to our enemi we should further say it 
is just to do good to our friend when they are good and harm to our 
enemi when they are evil 

ye that appear to me to be the truth 

but ought the just to injur ani one at all 

undoubtedli he ought to injur those who are both wick and hi 
enemi 

when hor are injur are they improv or deterior 

the latter 

deterior that is to say in the good qualiti of hor not of 
dog 

ye of hor 

and dog are deterior in the good qualiti of dog and not of 
hor 

of cour 

and will not men who are injur be deterior in that which is the 
proper virtu of man 

certainli 

and that human virtu is justic 

to be sure 

then men who are injur are of necess made unjust 

that is the result 

but can the musician by hi art make men unmu 

certainli not 

or the horseman by hi art make them bad horseman 

imposs 

and can the just by justic make men unjust or speak gener can 
the good by virtu make them bad 

assuredli not 

ani more than heat can produc cold 

it cannot 

or drought moistur 

clearli not 

nor can the good harm ani one 

imposs 

and the just is the good 

certainli 

then to injur a friend or ani one el is not the act of a just man 
but of the opposit who is the unjust 

i think that what you say is quit true socrat 

then if a man say that justic consist in the repay of debt and 
that good is the debt which a just man owe to hi friend and evil the 
debt which he owe to hi enemi to say thi is not wise for it is 
not true if a ha been clearli shown the injur of anoth can be 
in no case just 

i agr with you said polemarchu 

then you and i are prepar to take up arm against ani one who 
attribut such a say to simonid or bia or pittacu or ani other 
wise man or seer 

i am quit readi to do battl at your side he said 

shall i tell you whose i believ the say to be 

whose 

i believ that periand or perdicca or xerx or ismenia the theban 
or some other rich and mighti man who had a great opinion of hi own 
power wa the first to say that justic is do good to your friend 
and harm to your enemi 

most true he said 

ye i said but if thi definit of justic also break down what 
other can be offer 

sever time in the cour of the discu thrasymachu had made an 
attempt to get the argument into hi own hand and had been put down 
by the rest of the compani who want to hear the end but when 
polemarchu and i had done speak and there wa a pau he could no 
longer hold hi peac and gather himself up he came at u like a 
wild beast seek to devour u we were quit panic stricken at the 
sight of him 

he roar out to the whole compani what folli socrat ha taken 
poss of you all and whi sillybilli do you knock under to 
one anoth i say that if you want realli to know what justic is 
you should not onli ask but answer and you should not seek honour to 
yourself from the refut of an oppon but have your own answer 
for there is mani a one who can ask and cannot answer and now i will 
not have you say that justic is duti or advantag or profit or gain 
or interest for thi sort of nonsen will not do for me i must have 
clear and accuraci 

i wa panic stricken at hi word and could not look at him without 
trembl ind i believ that if i had not fix my eye upon him i 
should have been struck dumb but when i saw hi furi rise i look 
at him first and wa therefor abl to repli to him 

thrasymachu i said with a quiver don t be hard upon u polemarchu 
and i may have been guilti of a littl mistak in the argument but i 
can assur you that the error wa not intent if we were seek 
for a piec of gold you would not imagin that we were knock under 
to one anoth and so lose our chanc of find it and whi when 
we are seek for justic a thing more preciou than mani piec of 
gold do you say that we are weakli yield to one anoth and not 
do our utmost to get at the truth nay my good friend we are most 
will and anxiou to do so but the fact is that we cannot and if so 
you peopl who know all thing should piti u and not be angri with u 

how characterist of socrat he repli with a bitter laugh that s 
your iron style did i not fores have i not alreadi told you 
that whatev he wa ask he would refu to answer and tri ironi or 
ani other shuffl in order that he might avoid answer 

you are a philosoph thrasymachu i repli and well know that if 
you ask a person what number make up twelv take care to prohibit 
him whom you ask from answer twice six or three time four or six 
time two or four time three for thi sort of nonsen will not do 
for me then obviou if that is your way of put the 
question no one can answer you but suppo that he were to retort 
thrasymachu what do you mean if one of these number which you 
interdict be the true answer to the question am i fal to say some 
other number which is not the right one is that your mean how 
would you answer him 

just a if the two case were at all alik he said 

whi should they not be i repli and even if they are not but onli 
appear to be so to the person who is ask ought he not to say what he 
think whether you and i forbid him or not 

i presum then that you are go to make one of the interdict 
answer 

i dare say that i may notwithstand the danger if upon reflect i 
approv of ani of them 

but what if i give you an answer about justic other and better he 
said than ani of these what do you deserv to have done to you 

done to me a becom the ignor i must learn from the wise that 
is what i deserv to have done to me 

what and no payment a pleasant notion 

i will pay when i have the money i repli 

but you have socrat said glaucon and you thrasymachu need be 
under no anxieti about money for we will all make a contribut for 
socrat 

ye he repli and then socrat will do a he alway doe refu to 
answer himself but take and pull to piec the answer of some one el 

whi my good friend i said how can ani one answer who know and say 
that he know just noth and who even if he ha some faint notion 
of hi own is told by a man of author not to utter them the 
natur thing is that the speaker should be some one like yourself 
who profess to know and can tell what he know will you then kindli 
answer for the edif of the compani and of myself 

glaucon and the rest of the compani join in my request and 
thrasymachu a ani one might see wa in realiti eager to speak 
for he thought that he had an excel answer and would distinguish 
himself but at first he affect to insist on my answer at length 
he consent to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrat he 
refu to teach himself and go about learn of other to whom he 
never even say thank you 

that i learn of other i repli is quit true but that i am 
ungrat i wholli deni money i have none and therefor i pay in 
prai which is all i have and how readi i am to prai ani one who 
appear to me to speak well you will veri soon find out when you answer 
for i expect that you will answer well 

listen then he said i proclaim that justic is noth el than 
the interest of the stronger and now whi do you not prai me but of 
cour you won t 

let me first understand you i repli justic a you say is the 
interest of the stronger what thrasymachu is the mean of thi 
you cannot mean to say that becau polydama the pancratiast is 
stronger than we are and find the eat of beef conduc to hi 
bodili strength that to eat beef is therefor equal for our good who 
are weaker than he is and right and just for u 

that s abomin of you socrat you take the word in the sen 
which is most damag to the argument 

not at all my good sir i said i am tri to understand them and i 
wish that you would be a littl clearer 

well he said have you never heard that form of govern differ 
there are tyranni and there are democraci and there are 
aristocraci 

ye i know 

and the govern is the rule power in each state 

certainli 

and the differ form of govern make law democrat 
aristocrat tyrann with a view to their sever interest 
and these law which are made by them for their own interest are the 
justic which they deliv to their subject and him who transgress 
them they punish a a breaker of the law and unjust and that is what 
i mean when i say that in all state there is the same principl of 
justic which is the interest of the govern and a the govern 
must be suppo to have power the onli reason conclu is that 
everywh there is one principl of justic which is the interest of 
the stronger 

now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not i will 
tri to discov but let me remark that in defin justic you have 
yourself use the word interest which you forbad me to use it is 
true howev that in your definit the word of the stronger are 
ad 

a small addit you must allow he said 

great or small never mind about that we must first enquir whether 
what you are say is the truth now we are both agr that justic 
is interest of some sort but you go on to say of the stronger about 
thi addit i am not so sure and must therefor consid further 

proceed 

i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just for subject to 
obey their ruler 

i do 

but are the ruler of state absolut infal or are they 
sometim liabl to err 

to be sure he repli they are liabl to err 

then in make their law they may sometim make them rightli and 
sometim not 

true 

when they make them rightli they make them agreeabl to their interest 
when they are mistaken contrari to their interest you admit that 

ye 

and the law which they make must be obey by their subject and that 
is what you call justic 

doubtless 

then justic accord to your argument is not onli obedi to the 
interest of the stronger but the rever 

what is that you are say he ask 

i am onli repeat what you are say i believ but let u consid 
have we not admit that the ruler may be mistaken about their own 
interest in what they command and also that to obey them is justic 
ha not that been admit 

ye 

then you must also have acknowledg justic not to be for the interest 
of the stronger when the ruler unint command thing to be 
done which are to their own injuri for if a you say justic is the 
obedi which the subject render to their command in that case o 
wisest of men is there ani escap from the conclu that the weaker 
are command to do not what is for the interest but what is for the 
injuri of the stronger 

noth can be clearer socrat said polemarchu 

ye said cleitophon interpo if you are allow to be hi wit 

but there is no need of ani wit said polemarchu for thrasymachu 
himself acknowledg that ruler may sometim command what is not for 
their own interest and that for subject to obey them is justic 

ye polemarchu thrasymachu said that for subject to do what wa 
command by their ruler is just 

ye cleitophon but he also said that justic is the interest of the 
stronger and while admit both these proposit he further 
acknowledg that the stronger may command the weaker who are hi 
subject to do what is not for hi own interest whenc follow that 
justic is the injuri quit a much a the interest of the stronger 

but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what the 
stronger thought to be hi interest thi wa what the weaker had to 
do and thi wa affirm by him to be justic 

those were not hi word rejoin polemarchu 

never mind i repli if he now say that they are let u accept hi 
statement tell me thrasymachu i said did you mean by justic what 
the stronger thought to be hi interest whether realli so or not 

certainli not he said do you suppo that i call him who is mistaken 
the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 

ye i said my impress wa that you did so when you admit that 
the ruler wa not infal but might be sometim mistaken 

you argu like an inform socrat do you mean for exampl that he 
who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken 
or that he who err in arithmet or grammar is an arithmetician or 
grammarian at the time when he is make the mistak in respect of the 
mistak true we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian 
ha made a mistak but thi is onli a way of speak for the fact is 
that neither the grammarian nor ani other person of skill ever make a 
mistak in so far a he is what hi name impli they none of them 
err unless their skill fail them and then they cea to be skill 
artist no artist or sage or ruler err at the time when he is what 
hi name impli though he is commonli said to err and i adopt the 
common mode of speak but to be perfectli accur sinc you are 
such a lover of accuraci we should say that the ruler in so far a he 
is a ruler is uner and be uner alway command that which 
is for hi own interest and the subject is requir to execut hi 
command and therefor a i said at first and now repeat justic is 
the interest of the stronger 

ind thrasymachu and do i realli appear to you to argu like an 
inform 

certainli he repli 

and do you suppo that i ask these question with ani design of 
injur you in the argument 

nay he repli suppo is not the word i know it but you will be 
found out and by sheer forc of argument you will never prevail 

i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid ani 
misunderstand occur between u in futur let me ask in what 
sen do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest a you were 
say he be the superior it is just that the inferior should 
execut is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sen of the 
term 

in the strictest of all sen he said and now cheat and play the 
inform if you can i ask no quarter at your hand but you never will 
be abl never 

and do you imagin i said that i am such a madman a to tri and cheat 
thrasymachu i might a well shave a lion 

whi he said you made the attempt a minut ago and you fail 

enough i said of these civil it will be better that i should ask 
you a question is the physician taken in that strict sen of which 
you are speak a healer of the sick or a maker of money and rememb 
that i am now speak of the true physician 

a healer of the sick he repli 

and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captain of 
sailor or a mere sailor 

a captain of sailor 

the circumst that he sail in the ship is not to be taken into 
account neither is he to be call a sailor the name pilot by which he 
is distinguish ha noth to do with sail but is signif of 
hi skill and of hi author over the sailor 

veri true he said 

now i said everi art ha an interest 

certainli 

for which the art ha to consid and provid 

ye that is the aim of art 

and the interest of ani art is the perfect of it thi and noth 
el 

what do you mean 

i mean what i may illustr neg by the exampl of the bodi 
suppo you were to ask me whether the bodi is self suffic or ha 
want i should repli certainli the bodi ha want for the bodi may 
be ill and requir to be cure and ha therefor interest to which 
the art of medicin minist and thi is the origin and intent of 
medicin a you will acknowledg am i not right 

quit right he repli 

but is the art of medicin or ani other art faulti or defici in ani 
qualiti in the same way that the eye may be defici in sight or the 
ear fail of hear and therefor requir anoth art to provid 
for the interest of see and hear ha art in itself i say ani 
similar liabil to fault or defect and doe everi art requir anoth 
supplementari art to provid for it interest and that anoth and 
anoth without end or have the art to look onli after their 
own interest or have they no need either of themselv or of 
anoth have no fault or defect they have no need to correct 
them either by the exerci of their own art or of ani other they have 
onli to consid the interest of their subject matter for everi art 
remain pure and faultless while remain true that is to say while 
perfect and unimpair take the word in your preci sen and tell 
me whether i am not right 

ye clearli 

then medicin doe not consid the interest of medicin but the 
interest of the bodi 

true he said 

nor doe the art of horsemanship consid the interest of the art of 
horsemanship but the interest of the hor neither do ani other art 
care for themselv for they have no need they care onli for that 
which is the subject of their art 

true he said 

but sure thrasymachu the art are the superior and ruler of their 
own subject 

to thi he assent with a good deal of reluct 

then i said no scienc or art consid or enjoin the interest of the 
stronger or superior but onli the interest of the subject and weaker 

he made an attempt to contest thi proposit also but final 
acquiesc 

then i continu no physician in so far a he is a physician 
consid hi own good in what he prescrib but the good of hi 
patient for the true physician is also a ruler have the human bodi a 
a subject and is not a mere money maker that ha been admit 

ye 

and the pilot likewi in the strict sen of the term is a ruler of 
sailor and not a mere sailor 

that ha been admit 

and such a pilot and ruler will provid and prescrib for the interest 
of the sailor who is under him and not for hi own or the ruler s 
interest 

he gave a reluct ye 

then i said thrasymachu there is no one in ani rule who in so far 
a he is a ruler consid or enjoin what is for hi own interest but 
alway what is for the interest of hi subject or suitabl to hi art 
to that he look and that alon he consid in everyth which he 
say and doe 

when we had got to thi point in the argument and everi one saw that 
the definit of justic had been complet upset thrasymachu 
instead of repli to me said tell me socrat have you got a 
nur 

whi do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather to be 
answer 

becau she leaf you to snivel and never wipe your nose she ha not 
even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 

what make you say that i repli 

becau you fanci that the shepherd or neatherd fatten or tend the 
sheep or ox with a view to their own good and not to the good of 
himself or hi master and you further imagin that the ruler of 
state if they are true ruler never think of their subject a sheep 
and that they are not studi their own advantag day and night oh 
no and so entir astray are you in your idea about the just and 
unjust a not even to know that justic and the just are in realiti 
anoth s good that is to say the interest of the ruler and stronger 
and the loss of the subject and servant and injust the opposit for 
the unjust is lord over the truli simpl and just he is the stronger 
and hi subject do what is for hi interest and minist to hi 
happi which is veri far from be their own consid further 
most foolish socrat that the just is alway a loser in comparison 
with the unjust first of all in privat contract wherev the unjust 
is the partner of the just you will find that when the partnership is 
dissolv the unjust man ha alway more and the just le secondli 
in their deal with the state when there is an incom tax the just 
man will pay more and the unjust le on the same amount of incom 
and when there is anyth to be receiv the one gain noth and the 
other much observ also what happen when they take an offic there is 
the just man neglect hi affair and perhap suffer other loss 
and get noth out of the public becau he is just moreov he 
is hate by hi friend and acquaint for refu to serv them in 
unlaw way but all thi is rever in the case of the unjust man 
i am speak a befor of injust on a larg scale in which the 
advantag of the unjust is most appar and my mean will be most 
clearli seen if we turn to that highest form of injust in which the 
crimin is the happiest of men and the suffer or those who refu 
to do injust are the most miser that is to say tyranni which by 
fraud and forc take away the properti of other not littl by littl 
but wholes comprehend in one thing sacr a well a profan 
privat and public for which act of wrong if he were detect 
perpetr ani one of them singli he would be punish and incur 
great disgrac they who do such wrong in particular case are call 
robber of templ and man stealer and burglar and swindler and 
thief but when a man besid take away the money of the citizen 
ha made slave of them then instead of these name of reproach he is 
term happi and bless not onli by the citizen but by all who 
hear of hi have achiev the consumm of injust for mankind 
censur injust fear that they may be the victim of it and not 
becau they shrink from commit it and thu a i have shown 
socrat injust when on a suffici scale ha more strength and 
freedom and masteri than justic and a i said at first justic is 
the interest of the stronger wherea injust is a man s own profit 
and interest 

thrasymachu when he had thu spoken have like a bath man delug 
our ear with hi word had a mind to go away but the compani 
would not let him they insist that he should remain and defend hi 
posit and i myself ad my own humbl request that he would not 
leav u thrasymachu i said to him excel man how suggest 
are your remark and are you go to run away befor you have fairli 
taught or learn whether they are true or not is the attempt to 
determin the way of man s life so small a matter in your eye to 
determin how life may be pa by each one of u to the greatest 
advantag 

and do i differ from you he said a to the import of the enquiri 

you appear rather i repli to have no care or thought about u 
thrasymachu whether we live better or wor from not know what you 
say you know is to you a matter of indiff prith friend 
do not keep your knowledg to yourself we are a larg parti and ani 
benefit which you confer upon u will be ampli reward for my own 
part i openli declar that i am not convinc and that i do not believ 
injust to be more gain than justic even if uncontrol and 
allow to have free play for grant that there may be an unjust 
man who is abl to commit injust either by fraud or forc still thi 
doe not convinc me of the superior advantag of injust and there 
may be other who are in the same predica with myself perhap we 
may be wrong if so you in your wisdom should convinc u that we are 
mistaken in prefer justic to injust 

and how am i to convinc you he said if you are not alreadi convinc 
by what i have just said what more can i do for you would you have me 
put the proof bodili into your soul 

heaven forbid i said i would onli ask you to be consist or if you 
chang chang openli and let there be no decept for i must remark 
thrasymachu if you will recal what wa previou said that although 
you began by defin the true physician in an exact sen you did not 
observ a like exact when speak of the shepherd you thought that 
the shepherd a a shepherd tend the sheep not with a view to their own 
good but like a mere diner or banquett with a view to the pleasur 
of the tabl or again a a trader for sale in the market and not a 
a shepherd yet sure the art of the shepherd is concern onli with 
the good of hi subject he ha onli to provid the best for them 
sinc the perfect of the art is alreadi ensur whenev all the 
requir of it are satisfi and that wa what i wa say just 
now about the ruler i conceiv that the art of the ruler consid 
a ruler whether in a state or in privat life could onli regard the 
good of hi flock or subject wherea you seem to think that the ruler 
in state that is to say the true ruler like be in author 

think nay i am sure of it 

then whi in the case of lesser offic do men never take them willingli 
without payment unless under the idea that they govern for the 
advantag not of themselv but of other let me ask you a question 
are not the sever art differ by reason of their each have a 
separ function and my dear illustri friend do say what you 
think that we may make a littl progress 

ye that is the differ he repli 

and each art give u a particular good and not mere a gener 
one medicin for exampl give u health navig safeti at sea 
and so on 

ye he said 

and the art of payment ha the special function of give pay but we do 
not confu thi with other art ani more than the art of the pilot is 
to be confu with the art of medicin becau the health of the pilot 
may be improv by a sea voyag you would not be inclin to say would 
you that navig is the art of medicin at least if we are to adopt 
your exact use of languag 

certainli not 

or becau a man is in good health when he receiv pay you would not 
say that the art of payment is medicin 

i should not 

nor would you say that medicin is the art of receiv pay becau a 
man take fee when he is engag in heal 

certainli not 

and we have admit i said that the good of each art is special 
confin to the art 

ye 

then if there be ani good which all artist have in common that is to 
be attribut to someth of which they all have the common use 

true he repli 

and when the artist is benefit by receiv pay the advantag is 
gain by an addit use of the art of pay which is not the art 
profess by him 

he gave a reluct assent to thi 

then the pay is not deriv by the sever artist from their respect 
art but the truth is that while the art of medicin give health and 
the art of the builder build a hou anoth art attend them which 
is the art of pay the variou art may be do their own busi and 
benefit that over which they presid but would the artist receiv 
ani benefit from hi art unless he were paid a well 

i suppo not 

but doe he therefor confer no benefit when he work for noth 

certainli he confer a benefit 

then now thrasymachu there is no longer ani doubt that neither art 
nor govern provid for their own interest but a we were befor 
say they rule and provid for the interest of their subject who 
are the weaker and not the stronger to their good they attend and 
not to the good of the superior and thi is the reason my dear 
thrasymachu whi a i wa just now say no one is will to 
govern becau no one like to take in hand the reform of evil 
which are not hi concern without remun for in the execut of 
hi work and in give hi order to anoth the true artist doe not 
regard hi own interest but alway that of hi subject and therefor 
in order that ruler may be will to rule they must be paid in one of 
three mode of payment money or honour or a penalti for refu 

what do you mean socrat said glaucon the first two mode of payment 
are intellig enough but what the penalti is i do not understand or 
how a penalti can be a payment 

you mean that you do not understand the natur of thi payment which to 
the best men is the great induc to rule of cour you know that 
ambit and avar are held to be a ind they are a disgrac 

veri true 

and for thi reason i said money and honour have no attract for 
them good men do not wish to be openli demand payment for govern 
and so to get the name of hirel nor by secretli help themselv 
out of the public revenu to get the name of thief and not be 
ambiti they do not care about honour wherefor necess must be 
laid upon them and they must be induc to serv from the fear of 
punish and thi a i imagin is the reason whi the forward 
to take offic instead of wait to be compel ha been deem 
dishonour now the worst part of the punish is that he who 
refu to rule is liabl to be rule by one who is wor than himself 
and the fear of thi a i conceiv induc the good to take offic 
not becau they would but becau they cannot help not under the idea 
that they are go to have ani benefit or enjoy themselv but a 
a necess and becau they are not abl to commit the task of rule 
to ani one who is better than themselv or ind a good for there 
is reason to think that if a citi were compo entir of good men 
then to avoid offic would be a much an object of content a to 
obtain offic is at present then we should have plain proof that the 
true ruler is not meant by natur to regard hi own interest but that 
of hi subject and everi one who knew thi would choo rather to 
receiv a benefit from anoth than to have the troubl of confer 
one so far am i from agr with thrasymachu that justic is the 
interest of the stronger thi latter question need not be further 
discu at present but when thrasymachu say that the life of the 
unjust is more advantag than that of the just hi new statement 
appear to me to be of a far more seriou charact which of u ha 
spoken truli and which sort of life glaucon do you prefer 

i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantag he 
answer 

did you hear all the advantag of the unjust which thrasymachu wa 
rehear 

ye i heard him he repli but he ha not convinc me 

then shall we tri to find some way of convinc him if we can that he 
is say what is not true 

most certainli he repli 

if i said he make a set speech and we make anoth recount all the 
advantag of be just and he answer and we rejoin there must be a 
number and measur of the good which are claim on either side 
and in the end we shall want judg to decid but if we proceed in our 
enquiri a we late did by make admiss to one anoth we shall 
unit the offic of judg and advoc in our own person 

veri good he said 

and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 

that which you propo 

well then thrasymachu i said suppo you begin at the begin and 
answer me you say that perfect injust is more gain than perfect 
justic 

ye that is what i say and i have given you my reason 

and what is your view about them would you call one of them virtu and 
the other vice 

certainli 

i suppo that you would call justic virtu and injust vice 

what a charm notion so like too see that i affirm injust to 
be profit and justic not 

what el then would you say 

the opposit he repli 

and would you call justic vice 

no i would rather say sublim simplic 

then would you call injust malign 

no i would rather say discret 

and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 

ye he said at ani rate those of them who are abl to be perfectli 
unjust and who have the power of subdu state and nation but 
perhap you imagin me to be talk of cutpur even thi profess 
if undetect ha advantag though they are not to be compar with 
those of which i wa just now speak 

i do not think that i misapprehend your mean thrasymachu i 
repli but still i cannot hear without amaz that you class 
injust with wisdom and virtu and justic with the opposit 

certainli i do so class them 

now i said you are on more substanti and almost unansw ground 
for if the injust which you were maintain to be profit had 
been admit by you a by other to be vice and deform an answer 
might have been given to you on receiv principl but now i perceiv 
that you will call injust honour and strong and to the unjust 
you will attribut all the qualiti which were attribut by u befor 
to the just see that you do not hesit to rank injust with 
wisdom and virtu 

you have guess most infal he repli 

then i certainli ought not to shrink from go through with the 
argument so long a i have reason to think that you thrasymachu are 
speak your real mind for i do believ that you are now in earnest 
and are not amu yourself at our expen 

i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refut the 
argument is your busi 

veri true i said that is what i have to do but will you be so good 
a answer yet one more question doe the just man tri to gain ani 
advantag over the just 

far otherwi if he did he would not be the simpl amu creatur 
which he is 

and would he tri to go beyond just action 

he would not 

and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantag over the 
unjust would that be consid by him a just or unjust 

he would think it just and would tri to gain the advantag but he 
would not be abl 

whether he would or would not be abl i said is not to the point my 
question is onli whether the just man while refu to have more than 
anoth just man would wish and claim to have more than the unjust 

ye he would 

and what of the unjust doe he claim to have more than the just man and 
to do more than is just 

of cour he said for he claim to have more than all men 

and the unjust man will strive and struggl to obtain more than the 
unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 

true 

we may put the matter thu i said the just doe not desir more than 
hi like but more than hi unlik wherea the unjust desir more than 
both hi like and hi unlik 

noth he said can be better than that statement 

and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 

good again he said 

and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlik them 

of cour he said he who is of a certain natur is like those who are 
of a certain natur he who is not not 

each of them i said is such a hi like is 

certainli he repli 

veri good thrasymachu i said and now to take the case of the art 
you would admit that one man is a musician and anoth not a musician 

ye 

and which is wise and which is foolish 

clearli the musician is wise and he who is not a musician is foolish 

and he is good in a far a he is wise and bad in a far a he is 
foolish 

ye 

and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 

ye 

and do you think my excel friend that a musician when he adjust 
the lyre would desir or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the 
tighten and loosen the string 

i do not think that he would 

but he would claim to exceed the non musician 

of cour 

and what would you say of the physician in prescrib meat and drink 
would he wish to go beyond anoth physician or beyond the practic of 
medicin 

he would not 

but he would wish to go beyond the non physician 

ye 

and about knowledg and ignor in gener see whether you think that 
ani man who ha knowledg ever would wish to have the choic of say 
or do more than anoth man who ha knowledg would he not rather 
say or do the same a hi like in the same case 

that i suppo can hardli be deni 

and what of the ignor would he not desir to have more than either 
the know or the ignor 

i dare say 

and the know is wise 

ye 

and the wise is good 

true 

then the wise and good will not desir to gain more than hi like but 
more than hi unlik and opposit 

i suppo so 

wherea the bad and ignor will desir to gain more than both 

ye 

but did we not say thrasymachu that the unjust go beyond both hi 
like and unlik were not these your word 

they were 

and you also said that the just will not go beyond hi like but hi 
unlik 

ye 

then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like the evil 
and ignor 

that is the infer 

and each of them is such a hi like is 

that wa admit 

then the just ha turn out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and 
ignor 

thrasymachu made all these admiss not fluentli a i repeat 
them but with extrem reluct it wa a hot summer s day and the 
perspir pour from him in torrent and then i saw what i had 
never seen befor thrasymachu blush a we were now agr that 
justic wa virtu and wisdom and injust vice and ignor i 
proceed to anoth point 

well i said thrasymachu that matter is now settl but were we not 
also say that injust had strength do you rememb 

ye i rememb he said but do not suppo that i approv of what you 
are say or have no answer if howev i were to answer you would be 
quit certain to accu me of harangu therefor either permit me to 
have my say out or if you would rather ask do so and i will answer 
veri good a they say to stori tell old woman and will nod ye 
and no 

certainli not i said if contrari to your real opinion 

ye he said i will to plea you sinc you will not let me speak 
what el would you have 

noth in the world i said and if you are so dispo i will ask and 
you shall answer 

proceed 

then i will repeat the question which i ask befor in order that 
our examin of the rel natur of justic and injust may be 
carri on regularli a statement wa made that injust is stronger 
and more power than justic but now justic have been identifi 
with wisdom and virtu is easili shown to be stronger than injust 
if injust is ignor thi can no longer be question by ani one 
but i want to view the matter thrasymachu in a differ way you 
would not deni that a state may be unjust and may be unjustli attempt 
to enslav other state or may have alreadi enslav them and may be 
hold mani of them in subject 

true he repli and i will add that the best and most perfectli unjust 
state will be most like to do so 

i know i said that such wa your posit but what i would further 
consid is whether thi power which is poss by the superior state 
can exist or be exerci without justic or onli with justic 

if you are right in your view and justic is wisdom then onli with 
justic but if i am right then without justic 

i am delight thrasymachu to see you not onli nod assent and 
dissent but make answer which are quit excel 

that is out of civil to you he repli 

you are veri kind i said and would you have the good also to 
inform me whether you think that a state or an armi or a band of 
robber and thief or ani other gang of evil doer could act at all if 
they injur one anoth 

no ind he said they could not 

but if they abstain from injur one anoth then they might act 
togeth better 

ye 

and thi is becau injust creat divi and hatr and 
fight and justic impart harmoni and friendship is not that true 
thrasymachu 

i agr he said becau i do not wish to quarrel with you 

how good of you i said but i should like to know also whether 
injust have thi tendenc to arou hatr wherev exist 
among slave or among freeman will not make them hate one anoth and 
set them at varianc and render them incap of common action 

certainli 

and even if injust be found in two onli will they not quarrel and 
fight and becom enemi to one anoth and to the just 

they will 

and suppo injust abid in a singl person would your wisdom say 
that she lose or that she retain her natur power 

let u assum that she retain her power 

yet is not the power which injust exerci of such a natur that 
wherev she take up her abod whether in a citi in an armi in a 
famili or in ani other bodi that bodi is to begin with render 
incap of unit action by reason of sedit and distract and 
doe it not becom it own enemi and at varianc with all that oppo 
it and with the just is not thi the case 

ye certainli 

and is not injust equal fatal when exist in a singl person in 
the first place render him incap of action becau he is not 
at uniti with himself and in the second place make him an enemi to 
himself and the just is not that true thrasymachu 

ye 

and o my friend i said sure the god are just 

grant that they are 

but if so the unjust will be the enemi of the god and the just will 
be their friend 

feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i will not 
oppo you lest i should displea the compani 

well then proceed with your answer and let me have the remaind of 
my repast for we have alreadi shown that the just are clearli wiser and 
better and abler than the unjust and that the unjust are incap of 
common action nay more that to speak a we did of men who are evil 
act at ani time vigor togeth is not strictli true for 
if they had been perfectli evil they would have laid hand upon one 
anoth but it is evid that there must have been some remnant of 
justic in them which enabl them to combin if there had not been 
they would have injur one anoth a well a their victim they 
were but half villain in their enterpri for had they been whole 
villain and utterli unjust they would have been utterli incap of 
action that a i believ is the truth of the matter and not what you 
said at first but whether the just have a better and happier life than 
the unjust is a further question which we also propo to consid i 
think that they have and for the reason which i have given but still 
i should like to examin further for no light matter is at stake 
noth le than the rule of human life 

proceed 

i will proceed by ask a question would you not say that a hor ha 
some end 

i should 

and the end or use of a hor or of anyth would be that which could 
not be accomplish or not so well accomplish by ani other thing 

i do not understand he said 

let me explain can you see except with the eye 

certainli not 

or hear except with the ear 

no 

these then may be truli said to be the end of these organ 

they may 

but you can cut off a vine branch with a dagger or with a chisel and in 
mani other way 

of cour 

and yet not so well a with a prune hook made for the purpo 

true 

may we not say that thi is the end of a prune hook 

we may 

then now i think you will have no difficulti in understand my mean 
when i ask the question whether the end of anyth would be that 
which could not be accomplish or not so well accomplish by ani 
other thing 

i understand your mean he said and assent 

and that to which an end is appoint ha also an excel need i ask 
again whether the eye ha an end 

it ha 

and ha not the eye an excel 

ye 

and the ear ha an end and an excel also 

true 

and the same is true of all other thing they have each of them an end 
and a special excel 

that is so 

well and can the eye fulfil their end if they are want in their own 
proper excel and have a defect instead 

how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 

you mean to say if they have lost their proper excel which is 
sight but i have not arriv at that point yet i would rather ask 
the question more gener and onli enquir whether the thing which 
fulfil their end fulfil them by their own proper excel and fail 
of fulfil them by their own defect 

certainli he repli 

i might say the same of the ear when depriv of their own proper 
excel they cannot fulfil their end 

true 

and the same observ will appli to all other thing 

i agr 

well and ha not the soul an end which noth el can fulfil for 
exampl to superintend and command and delib and the like are not 
these function proper to the soul and can they rightli be assign to 
ani other 

to no other 

and is not life to be reckon among the end of the soul 

assuredli he said 

and ha not the soul an excel also 

ye 

and can she or can she not fulfil her own end when depriv of that 
excel 

she cannot 

then an evil soul must necessarili be an evil ruler and superintend 
and the good soul a good ruler 

ye necessarili 

and we have admit that justic is the excel of the soul and 
injust the defect of the soul 

that ha been admit 

then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjust man 
will live ill 

that is what your argument prof 

and he who life well is bless and happi and he who life ill the 
rever of happi 

certainli 

then the just is happi and the unjust miser 

so be it 

but happi and not miseri is profit 

of cour 

then my bless thrasymachu injust can never be more profit 
than justic 

let thi socrat he said be your entertain at the bendidea 

for which i am indebt to you i said now that you have grown gentl 
toward me and have left off scold nevertheless i have not been 
well entertain but that wa my own fault and not your a an epicur 
snatch a tast of everi dish which is success brought to tabl 
he not have allow himself time to enjoy the one befor so have i 
gone from one subject to anoth without have discov what i sought 
at first the natur of justic i left that enquiri and turn away 
to consid whether justic is virtu and wisdom or evil and folli and 
when there aro a further question about the compar advantag of 
justic and injust i could not refrain from pa on to that and 
the result of the whole discu ha been that i know noth at all 
for i know not what justic is and therefor i am not like to know 
whether it is or is not a virtu nor can i say whether the just man is 
happi or unhappi 




book ii 

with these word i wa think that i had made an end of the 
discu but the end in truth prove to be onli a begin for 
glaucon who is alway the most pugnaci of men wa dissatisfi at 
thrasymachu retir he want to have the battl out so he said 
to me socrat do you wish realli to persuad u or onli to seem to 
have persuad u that to be just is alway better than to be unjust 

i should wish realli to persuad you i repli if i could 

then you certainli have not succeed let me ask you now how would 
you arrang good are there not some which we welcom for their 
own sake and independ of their consequ a for exampl 
harmless pleasur and enjoy which delight u at the time 
although noth follow from them 

i agr in think that there is such a class i repli 

is there not also a second class of good such a knowledg sight 
health which are desir not onli in themselv but also for their 
result 

certainli i said 

and would you not recogn a third class such a gymnast and the 
care of the sick and the physician s art also the variou way of 
money make these do u good but we regard them a disagr and 
no one would choo them for their own sake but onli for the sake of 
some reward or result which flow from them 

there is i said thi third class also but whi do you ask 

becau i want to know in which of the three class you would place 
justic 

in the highest class i repli among those good which he who would 
be happi desir both for their own sake and for the sake of their 
result 

then the mani are of anoth mind they think that justic is to be 
reckon in the troublesom class among good which are to be pursu 
for the sake of reward and of reput but in themselv are 
disagr and rather to be avoid 

i know i said that thi is their manner of think and that thi wa 
the thesi which thrasymachu wa maintain just now when he censur 
justic and prai injust but i am too stupid to be convinc by 
him 

i wish he said that you would hear me a well a him and then i shall 
see whether you and i agr for thrasymachu seem to me like a snake 
to have been charm by your voic sooner than he ought to have been 
but to my mind the natur of justic and injust have not yet been 
made clear set asid their reward and result i want to know what 
they are in themselv and how they inwardli work in the soul if you 
plea then i will reviv the argument of thrasymachu and first i 
will speak of the natur and origin of justic accord to the common 
view of them secondli i will show that all men who practi justic do 
so against their will of necess but not a a good and thirdli i 
will argu that there is reason in thi view for the life of the unjust 
is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say 
is true socrat sinc i myself am not of their opinion but still i 
acknowledg that i am perplex when i hear the voic of thrasymachu 
and myriad of other din in my ear and on the other hand i have 
never yet heard the superior of justic to injust maintain by 
ani one in a satisfactori way i want to hear justic prai in respect 
of itself then i shall be satisfi and you are the person from whom 
i think that i am most like to hear thi and therefor i will prai 
the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speak 
will indic the manner in which i desir to hear you too prai 
justic and censur injust will you say whether you approv of my 
propo 

ind i do nor can i imagin ani theme about which a man of sen 
would often wish to conver 

i am delight he repli to hear you say so and shall begin by 
speak a i propo of the natur and origin of justic 

they say that to do injust is by natur good to suffer injust 
evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have 
both done and suffer injust and have had experi of both not 
be abl to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they 
had better agr among themselv to have neither henc there ari 
law and mutual coven and that which is ordain by law is term 
by them law and just thi they affirm to be the origin and natur of 
justic it is a mean or compromi between the best of all which is 
to do injust and not be punish and the worst of all which is to 
suffer injust without the power of retali and justic be at 
a middl point between the two is toler not a a good but a 
the lesser evil and honour by reason of the inabl of men to do 
injust for no man who is worthi to be call a man would ever submit 
to such an agreement if he were abl to resist he would be mad if he 
did such is the receiv account socrat of the natur and origin of 
justic 

now that those who practi justic do so involuntarili and becau they 
have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagin someth 
of thi kind have given both to the just and the unjust power to do 
what they will let u watch and see whither desir will lead them 
then we shall discov in the veri act the just and unjust man to be 
proceed along the same road follow their interest which all 
natur deem to be their good and are onli divert into the path of 
justic by the forc of law the liberti which we are suppo may be 
most complet given to them in the form of such a power a is said 
to have been poss by gyge the ancestor of croesu the lydian 
accord to the tradit gyge wa a shepherd in the servic of 
the king of lydia there wa a great storm and an earthquak made an 
open in the earth at the place where he wa feed hi flock amaz 
at the sight he descend into the open where among other marvel 
he beheld a hollow brazen hor have door at which he stoop and 
look in saw a dead bodi of statur a appear to him more than 
human and have noth on but a gold ring thi he took from the 
finger of the dead and reascend now the shepherd met togeth 
accord to custom that they might send their monthli report about the 
flock to the king into their assembl he came have the ring on hi 
finger and a he wa sit among them he chanc to turn the collet 
of the ring insid hi hand when instantli he becam invi to the 
rest of the compani and they began to speak of him a if he were no 
longer present he wa astonish at thi and again touch the ring 
he turn the collet outward and reappear he made sever trial 
of the ring and alway with the same result when he turn the collet 
inward he becam invi when outward he reappear whereupon he 
contriv to be chosen one of the messeng who were sent to the court 
wherea soon a he arriv he seduc the queen and with her help 
conspir against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppo 
now that there were two such magic ring and the just put on one of 
them and the unjust the other no man can be imagin to be of such an 
iron natur that he would stand fast in justic no man would keep hi 
hand off what wa not hi own when he could safe take what he 
like out of the market or go into hou and lie with ani one at 
hi pleasur or kill or relea from prison whom he would and in all 
respect be like a god among men then the action of the just would be 
a the action of the unjust they would both come at last to the same 
point and thi we may truli affirm to be a great proof that a man is 
just not willingli or becau he think that justic is ani good to him 
individu but of necess for wherev ani one think that he 
can safe be unjust there he is unjust for all men believ in their 
heart that injust is far more profit to the individu than 
justic and he who argu a i have been suppo will say that they 
are right if you could imagin ani one obtain thi power of becom 
invi and never do ani wrong or touch what wa anoth s he 
would be thought by the looker on to be a most wretch idiot although 
they would prai him to one anoth s face and keep up appear 
with one anoth from a fear that they too might suffer injust 
enough of thi 

now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and 
unjust we must isol them there is no other way and how is the 
isol to be effect i answer let the unjust man be entir 
unjust and the just man entir just noth is to be taken away from 
either of them and both are to be perfectli furnish for the work 
of their respect life first let the unjust be like other 
distinguish master of craft like the skil pilot or physician who 
know intuit hi own power and keep within their limit and who 
if he fail at ani point is abl to recov himself so let the unjust 
make hi unjust attempt in the right way and lie hidden if he mean 
to be great in hi injust he who is found out is nobodi for 
the highest reach of injust is to be deem just when you are not 
therefor i say that in the perfectli unjust man we must assum the most 
perfect injust there is to be no deduct but we must allow 
him while do the most unjust act to have acquir the greatest 
reput for justic if he have taken a fal step he must be abl to 
recov himself he must be one who can speak with effect if ani of hi 
deed come to light and who can forc hi way where forc is requir 
by hi courag and strength and command of money and friend and at 
hi side let u place the just man in hi nobl and simplic 
wish a aeschylu say to be and not to seem good there must be no 
seem for if he seem to be just he will be honour and reward and 
then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justic or 
for the sake of honour and reward therefor let him be cloth in 
justic onli and have no other cover and he must be imagin in a 
state of life the opposit of the former let him be the best of men 
and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the 
proof and we shall see whether he will be affect by the fear of 
infami and it consequ and let him continu thu to the hour of 
death be just and seem to be unjust when both have reach the 
uttermost extrem the one of justic and the other of injust let 
judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 

heaven my dear glaucon i said how energet you polish them 
up for the deci first one and then the other a if they were two 
statu 

i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there 
is no difficulti in trace out the sort of life which await either 
of them thi i will proceed to describ but a you may think the 
descript a littl too coar i ask you to suppo socrat that 
the word which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouth of 
the eulogist of injust they will tell you that the just man who is 
thought unjust will be scourg rack bound will have hi eye 
burnt out and at last after suffer everi kind of evil he will be 
impal then he will understand that he ought to seem onli and not to 
be just the word of aeschylu may be more truli spoken of the unjust 
than of the just for the unjust is pursu a realiti he doe not live 
with a view to appear he want to be realli unjust and not to seem 
onli 

hi mind ha a soil deep and fertil out of which spring hi prudent 
counsel 

in the first place he is thought just and therefor bear rule in the 
citi he can marri whom he will and give in marriag to whom he 
will also he can trade and deal where he like and alway to hi own 
advantag becau he ha no misgiv about injust and at everi 
contest whether in public or privat he get the better of hi 
antagonist and gain at their expen and is rich and out of hi 
gain he can benefit hi friend and harm hi enemi moreov he 
can offer sacrif and dedic gift to the god abundantli and 
magnif and can honour the god or ani man whom he want to 
honour in a far better style than the just and therefor he is like 
to be dearer than they are to the god and thu socrat god and men 
are said to unit in make the life of the unjust better than the life 
of the just 

i wa go to say someth in answer to glaucon when adeimantu hi 
brother interpo socrat he said you do not suppo that there is 
noth more to be urg 

whi what el is there i answer 

the strongest point of all ha not been even mention he repli 

well then accord to the proverb let brother help brother if 
he fail in ani part do you assist him although i must confess that 
glaucon ha alreadi said quit enough to lay me in the dust and take 
from me the power of help justic 

nonsen he repli but let me add someth more there is anoth 
side to glaucon s argument about the prai and censur of justic 
and injust which is equal requir in order to bring out what i 
believ to be hi mean parent and tutor are alway tell their 
son and their ward that they are to be just but whi not for the sake 
of justic but for the sake of charact and reput in the hope of 
obtain for him who is reput just some of those offic marriag 
and the like which glaucon ha enum among the advantag accru 
to the unjust from the reput of justic more howev is made of 
appear by thi class of person than by the other for they 
throw in the good opinion of the god and will tell you of a shower of 
benefit which the heaven a they say rain upon the piou and thi 
accord with the testimoni of the nobl hesiod and homer the first of 
whom say that the god make the oak of the just 

to bear acorn at their summit and bee in the middl 
and the sheep are bow down with the weight of their fleec 

and mani other bless of a like kind are provid for them and homer 
ha a veri similar strain for he speak of one whose fame is 

a the fame of some blameless king who like a god maintain justic 
to whom the black earth bring forth wheat and barley whose tree are 
bow with fruit and hi sheep never fail to bear and the sea give 
him fish 

still grander are the gift of heaven which musaeu and hi son 
vouchsaf to the just they take them down into the world below where 
they have the saint lie on couch at a feast everlastingli drunk 
crown with garland their idea seem to be that an immort of 
drunken is the highest meed of virtu some extend their reward 
yet further the poster a they say of the faith and just shall 
surviv to the third and fourth gener thi is the style in which 
they prai justic but about the wick there is anoth strain they 
buri them in a slough in hade and make them carri water in a siev 
also while they are yet live they bring them to infami and inflict 
upon them the punish which glaucon describ a the portion of the 
just who are reput to be unjust noth el doe their invent 
suppli such is their manner of prai the one and censur the 
other 

onc more socrat i will ask you to consid anoth way of speak 
about justic and injust which is not confin to the poet but 
is found in prose writer the univ voic of mankind is alway 
declar that justic and virtu are honour but grievou and 
toilsom and that the pleasur of vice and injust are easi of 
attain and are onli censur by law and opinion they say also that 
honesti is for the most part le profit than dishonesti and they 
are quit readi to call wick men happi and to honour them both in 
public and privat when they are rich or in ani other way influenti 
while they despi and overlook those who may be weak and poor even 
though acknowledg them to be better than the other but most 
extraordinari of all is their mode of speak about virtu and the 
god they say that the god apport calam and miseri to mani good 
men and good and happi to the wick and mendic prophet go to 
rich men s door and persuad them that they have a power commit 
to them by the god of make an aton for a man s own or hi 
ancestor s sin by sacrif or charm with rejoic and feast and 
they promi to harm an enemi whether just or unjust at a small cost 
with magic art and incant bind heaven a they say to execut 
their will and the poet are the author to whom they appeal now 
smooth the path of vice with the word of hesiod 

vice may be had in abund without troubl the way is smooth and her 
dwell place is near but befor virtu the god have set toil 

and a tediou and uphil road then cite homer a a wit that the 
god may be influenc by men for he also say 

the god too may be turn from their purpo and men pray to them 
and avert their wrath by sacrif and sooth entreati and by 
libat and the odour of fat when they have sin and transgress 

and they produc a host of book written by musaeu and orpheu 
who were child of the moon and the muse that is what they 
say accord to which they perform their ritual and persuad not onli 
individu but whole citi that expiat and aton for sin 
may be made by sacrif and amu which fill a vacant hour and 
are equal at the servic of the live and the dead the latter sort 
they call mysteri and they redeem u from the pain of hell but if 
we neglect them no one know what await u 

he proceed and now when the young hear all thi said about virtu and 
vice and the way in which god and men regard them how are their mind 
like to be affect my dear socrat those of them i mean who are 
quickwit and like bee on the wing light on everi flower and from 
all that they hear are prone to draw conclu a to what manner of 
person they should be and in what way they should walk if they would 
make the best of life probabl the youth will say to himself in the 
word of pindar 

can i by justic or by crook way of deceit ascend a loftier tower 
which may be a fortress to me all my day 

for what men say is that if i am realli just and am not also thought 
just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand 
are unmistak but if though unjust i acquir the reput of 
justic a heavenli life is promi to me sinc then a philosoph 
prove appear tyrann over truth and is lord of happi to 
appear i must devot myself i will describ around me a pictur and 
shadow of virtu to be the vestibul and exterior of my hou behind i 
will trail the subtl and crafti fox a archilochu greatest of sage 
recommend but i hear some one exclaim that the conceal of 
wick is often difficult to which i answer noth great is easi 
nevertheless the argument indic thi if we would be happi to be 
the path along which we should proceed with a view to conceal we 
will establish secret brotherhood and polit club and there 
are professor of rhetor who teach the art of persuad court and 
assembl and so partli by persua and partli by forc i shall 
make unlaw gain and not be punish still i hear a voic say 
that the god cannot be deceiv neither can they be compel but 
what if there are no god or suppo them to have no care of human 
thing whi in either case should we mind about conceal and even if 
there are god and they do care about u yet we know of them onli 
from tradit and the genealog of the poet and these are the veri 
person who say that they may be influenc and turn by sacrif 
and sooth entreati and by offer let u be consist then 
and believ both or neither if the poet speak truli whi then we had 
better be unjust and offer of the fruit of injust for if we are 
just although we may escap the vengeanc of heaven we shall lose the 
gain of injust but if we are unjust we shall keep the gain and 
by our sin and pray and pray and sin the god will be 
propiti and we shall not be punish but there is a world below 
in which either we or our poster will suffer for our unjust deed 
ye my friend will be the reflect but there are mysteri and 
aton deiti and these have great power that is what mighti 
citi declar and the child of the god who were their poet and 
prophet bear a like testimoni 

on what principl then shall we ani longer choo justic rather than 
the worst injust when if we onli unit the latter with a deceit 
regard to appear we shall fare to our mind both with god and 
men in life and after death a the most numer and the highest 
author tell u know all thi socrat how can a man who 
ha ani superior of mind or person or rank or wealth be will to 
honour justic or ind to refrain from laugh when he hear justic 
prai and even if there should be some one who is abl to disprov 
the truth of my word and who is satisfi that justic is best still 
he is not angri with the unjust but is veri readi to forgiv them 
becau he also know that men are not just of their own free will 
unless peradventur there be some one whom the divin within him may 
have inspir with a hatr of injust or who ha attain knowledg 
of the truth but no other man he onli blame injust who owe to 
coward or age or some weak ha not the power of be unjust 
and thi is prove by the fact that when he obtain the power he 
immedi becom unjust a far a he can be 

the cau of all thi socrat wa indic by u at the begin of 
the argument when my brother and i told you how astonish we were to 
find that of all the profess panegyrist of justic begin with 
the ancient hero of whom ani memori ha been preserv to u and 
end with the men of our own time no one ha ever blame injust or 
prai justic except with a view to the glori honour and benefit 
which flow from them no one ha ever adequ describ either in 
ver or prose the true essenti natur of either of them abid in 
the soul and invi to ani human or divin eye or shown that of 
all the thing of a man s soul which he ha within him justic is 
the greatest good and injust the greatest evil had thi been the 
univ strain had you sought to persuad u of thi from our youth 
upward we should not have been on the watch to keep one anoth from 
do wrong but everi one would have been hi own watchman becau 
afraid if he did wrong of harbour in himself the greatest of 
evil i dare say that thrasymachu and other would seriou hold the 
languag which i have been mere repeat and word even stronger 
than these about justic and injust grossli a i conceiv 
pervert their true natur but i speak in thi vehement manner a 
i must frankli confess to you becau i want to hear from you the 
opposit side and i would ask you to show not onli the superior 
which justic ha over injust but what effect they have on the 
possessor of them which make the one to be a good and the other an evil 
to him and plea a glaucon request of you to exclud reput 
for unless you take away from each of them hi true reput and 
add on the fal we shall say that you do not prai justic but the 
appear of it we shall think that you are onli exhort u to keep 
injust dark and that you realli agr with thrasymachu in think 
that justic is anoth s good and the interest of the stronger and 
that injust is a man s own profit and interest though injuri to 
the weaker now a you have admit that justic is one of that highest 
class of good which are desir ind for their result but in a far 
greater degr for their own sake like sight or hear or knowledg 
or health or ani other real and natur and not mere convent 
good i would ask you in your prai of justic to regard one point 
onli i mean the essenti good and evil which justic and injust 
work in the possessor of them let other prai justic and censur 
injust magnifi the reward and honour of the one and abu the 
other that is a manner of argu which come from them i am 
readi to toler but from you who have spent your whole life in the 
consid of thi question unless i hear the contrari from your own 
lip i expect someth better and therefor i say not onli prove to 
u that justic is better than injust but show what they either of 
them do to the possessor of them which make the one to be a good and 
the other an evil whether seen or unseen by god and men 

i had alway admir the geniu of glaucon and adeimantu but on 
hear these word i wa quit delight and said son of an 
illustri father that wa not a bad begin of the elegiac ver 
which the admir of glaucon made in honour of you after you had 
distinguish yourselv at the battl of megara 

son of ariston he sang divin offspr of an illustri hero 

the epithet is veri appropri for there is someth truli divin in 
be abl to argu a you have done for the superior of injust 
and remain unconvinc by your own argument and i do believ that 
you are not convinc thi i infer from your gener charact for had 
i judg onli from your speech i should have mistrust you but 
now the greater my confid in you the greater is my difficulti in 
know what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i 
feel that i am unequ to the task and my inabl is brought home to 
me by the fact that you were not satisfi with the answer which i made 
to thrasymachu prove a i thought the superior which justic 
ha over injust and yet i cannot refu to help while breath and 
speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impieti in be 
present when justic is evil spoken of and not lift up a hand in her 
defenc and therefor i had best give such help a i can 

glaucon and the rest entreat me by all mean not to let the question 
drop but to proceed in the investig they want to arriv at the 
truth first about the natur of justic and injust and secondli 
about their rel advantag i told them what i realli thought 
that the enquiri would be of a seriou natur and would requir veri 
good eye see then i said that we are no great wit i think that 
we had better adopt a method which i may illustr thu suppo that 
a short sight person had been ask by some one to read small letter 
from a distanc and it occur to some one el that they might be 
found in anoth place which wa larger and in which the letter were 
larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letter 
first and then proceed to the lesser thi would have been thought a 
rare piec of good fortun 

veri true said adeimantu but how doe the illustr appli to our 
enquiri 

i will tell you i repli justic which is the subject of our 
enquiri is a you know sometim spoken of a the virtu of an 
individu and sometim a the virtu of a state 

true he repli 

and is not a state larger than an individu 

it is 

then in the larger the quantiti of justic is like to be larger and 
more easili discern i propo therefor that we enquir into the 
natur of justic and injust first a they appear in the state and 
secondli in the individu proceed from the greater to the lesser 
and compar them 

that he said is an excel propo 

and if we imagin the state in process of creation we shall see the 
justic and injust of the state in process of creation also 

i dare say 

when the state is complet there may be a hope that the object of our 
search will be more easili discov 

ye far more easili 

but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so a i am 
inclin to think will be a veri seriou task reflect therefor 

i have reflect said adeimantu and am anxiou that you should 
proceed 

a state i said ari a i conceiv out of the need of mankind 
no one is self suffic but all of u have mani want can ani other 
origin of a state be imagin 

there can be no other 

then a we have mani want and mani person are need to suppli them 
one take a helper for one purpo and anoth for anoth and when 
these partner and helper are gather togeth in one habit the 
bodi of inhabit is term a state 

true he said 

and they exchang with one anoth and one give and anoth receiv 
under the idea that the exchang will be for their good 

veri true 

then i said let u begin and creat in idea a state and yet the true 
creator is necess who is the mother of our invent 

of cour he repli 

now the first and greatest of necess is food which is the 
condit of life and exist 

certainli 

the second is a dwell and the third cloth and the like 

true 

and now let u see how our citi will be abl to suppli thi great 
demand we may suppo that one man is a husbandman anoth a builder 
some one el a weaver shall we add to them a shoemak or perhap 
some other purveyor to our bodili want 

quit right 

the barest notion of a state must includ four or five men 

clearli 

and how will they proceed will each bring the result of hi labour 
into a common stock the individu husbandman for exampl produc 
for four and labour four time a long and a much a he need in the 
provi of food with which he suppli other a well a himself 
or will he have noth to do with other and not be at the troubl of 
produc for them but provid for himself alon a fourth of the food 
in a fourth of the time and in the remain three fourth of hi time 
be employ in make a hou or a coat or a pair of shoe have no 
partnership with other but suppli himself all hi own want 

adeimantu thought that he should aim at produc food onli and not at 
produc everyth 

probabl i repli that would be the better way and when i hear you 
say thi i am myself remind that we are not all alik there 
are diver of natur among u which are adapt to differ 
occup 

veri true 

and will you have a work better done when the workman ha mani 
occup or when he ha onli one 

when he ha onli one 

further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at 
the right time 

no doubt 

for busi is not dispo to wait until the doer of the busi is 
at leisur but the doer must follow up what he is do and make the 
busi hi first object 

he must 

and if so we must infer that all thing are produc more plenti 
and easili and of a better qualiti when one man doe one thing which is 
natur to him and doe it at the right time and leaf other thing 

undoubtedli 

then more than four citizen will be requir for the husbandman will 
not make hi own plough or mattock or other implement of agricultur 
if they are to be good for anyth neither will the builder make 
hi tool and he too need mani and in like manner the weaver and 
shoemak 

true 

then carpent and smith and mani other artisan will be sharer in 
our littl state which is alreadi begin to grow 

true 

yet even if we add neatherd shepherd and other herdsman in order 
that our husbandman may have ox to plough with and builder a well 
a husbandman may have draught cattl and currier and weaver fleec 
and hide still our state will not be veri larg 

that is true yet neither will it be a veri small state which contain 
all these 

then again there is the situat of the citi to find a place where 
noth need be import is wellnigh imposs 

imposs 

then there must be anoth class of citizen who will bring the requir 
suppli from anoth citi 

there must 

but if the trader go empti hand have noth which they requir 
who would suppli hi need he will come back empti hand 

that is certain 

and therefor what they produc at home must be not onli enough for 
themselv but such both in quantiti and qualiti a to accommod 
those from whom their want are suppli 

veri true 

then more husbandman and more artisan will be requir 

they will 

not to mention the import and export who are call merchant 

ye 

then we shall want merchant 

we shall 

and if merchandi is to be carri over the sea skil sailor will 
also be need and in consid number 

ye in consid number 

then again within the citi how will they exchang their product 
to secur such an exchang wa a you will rememb one of our 
princip object when we form them into a societi and constitut a 
state 

clearli they will buy and sell 

then they will need a market place and a money token for purpo of 
exchang 

certainli 

suppo now that a husbandman or an artisan bring some product 
to market and he come at a time when there is no one to exchang with 
him is he to leav hi call and sit idl in the market place 

not at all he will find peopl there who see the want undertak 
the offic of salesman in well order state they are commonli those 
who are the weakest in bodili strength and therefor of littl use for 
ani other purpo their duti is to be in the market and to give money 
in exchang for good to those who desir to sell and to take money from 
those who desir to buy 

thi want then creat a class of retail trader in our state is 
not retail the term which is appli to those who sit in the 
market place engag in buy and sell while those who wander from 
one citi to anoth are call merchant 

ye he said 

and there is anoth class of servant who are intellectu hardli 
on the level of companionship still they have plenti of bodili strength 
for labour which accordingli they sell and are call if i do not 
mistak hirel hire be the name which is given to the price of 
their labour 

true 

then hirel will help to make up our popul 

ye 

and now adeimantu is our state matur and perfect 

i think so 

where then is justic and where is injust and in what part of the 
state did they spring up 

probabl in the deal of these citizen with one anoth i cannot 
imagin that they are more like to be found ani where el 

i dare say that you are right in your suggest i said we had better 
think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiri 

let u then consid first of all what will be their way of life 
now that we have thu establish them will they not produc corn and 
wine and cloth and shoe and build hou for themselv and 
when they are hou they will work in summer commonli strip and 
barefoot but in winter substanti cloth and shod they will feed 
on barley meal and flour of wheat bake and knead them make 
nobl cake and loaf these they will serv up on a mat of reed or on 
clean leaf themselv reclin the while upon bed strewn with yew 
or myrtl and they and their child will feast drink of the wine 
which they have made wear garland on their head and hymn the 
prai of the god in happi conver with one anoth and they will 
take care that their famili do not exceed their mean have an eye 
to poverti or war 

but said glaucon interpo you have not given them a relish to 
their meal 

true i repli i had forgotten of cour they must have a 
relish salt and oliv and chee and they will boil root and herb 
such a countri peopl prepar for a dessert we shall give them fig 
and pea and bean and they will roast myrtl berri and acorn 
at the fire drink in moder and with such a diet they may be 
expect to live in peac and health to a good old age and bequeath a 
similar life to their child after them 

ye socrat he said and if you were provid for a citi of pig 
how el would you feed the beast 

but what would you have glaucon i repli 

whi he said you should give them the ordinari conveni of life 
peopl who are to be comfort are accustom to lie on sofa and 
dine off tabl and they should have sauc and sweet in the modern 
style 

ye i said now i understand the question which you would have me 
consid is not onli how a state but how a luxuri state is creat 
and possibl there is no harm in thi for in such a state we shall be 
more like to see how justic and injust origin in my opinion 
the true and healthi constitut of the state is the one which i have 
describ but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have 
no object for i suspect that mani will not be satisfi with the 
simpler way of life they will be for ad sofa and tabl 
and other furnitur also dainti and perfum and incen and 
courtesan and cake all these not of one sort onli but in everi 
varieti we must go beyond the necessari of which i wa at first 
speak such a hou and cloth and shoe the art of the 
painter and the embroid will have to be set in motion and gold and 
ivori and all sort of materi must be procur 

true he said 

then we must enlarg our border for the origin healthi state is 
no longer suffici now will the citi have to fill and swell with a 
multitud of call which are not requir by ani natur want such 
a the whole tribe of hunter and actor of whom one larg class 
have to do with form and colour anoth will be the votari of 
music poet and their attend train of rhapsodist player dancer 
contractor also maker of diver kind of articl includ woman s 
dress and we shall want more servant will not tutor be also in 
request and nur wet and dri tirewomen and barber a well a 
confect and cook and swineherd too who were not need and 
therefor had no place in the former edit of our state but are 
need now they must not be forgotten and there will be anim of 
mani other kind if peopl eat them 

certainli 

and live in thi way we shall have much greater need of physician 
than befor 

much greater 

and the countri which wa enough to support the origin inhabit 
will be too small now and not enough 

quit true 

then a slice of our neighbour land will be want by u for pastur 
and tillag and they will want a slice of our if like ourselv 
they exceed the limit of necess and give themselv up to the 
unlimit accumul of wealth 

that socrat will be inevit 

and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 

most certainli he repli 

then without determin a yet whether war doe good or harm thu much 
we may affirm that now we have discov war to be deriv from cau 
which are also the cau of almost all the evil in state privat a 
well a public 

undoubtedli 

and our state must onc more enlarg and thi time the enlarg will 
be noth short of a whole armi which will have to go out and fight 
with the invad for all that we have a well a for the thing and 
person whom we were describ abov 

whi he said are they not capabl of defend themselv 

no i said not if we were right in the principl which wa acknowledg 
by all of u when we were frame the state the principl a you will 
rememb wa that one man cannot practi mani art with success 

veri true he said 

but is not war an art 

certainli 

and an art requir a much attent a shoemak 

quit true 

and the shoemak wa not allow by u to be a husbandman or a weaver 
or a builder in order that we might have our shoe well made but to 
him and to everi other worker wa assign one work for which he wa by 
natur fit and at that he wa to continu work all hi life long 
and at no other he wa not to let opportun slip and then he would 
becom a good workman now noth can be more import than that 
the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easili 
acquir that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or 
shoemak or other artisan although no one in the world would be a 
good dice or draught player who mere took up the game a a recreat 
and had not from hi earliest year devot himself to thi and noth 
el no tool will make a man a skill workman or master of defenc 
nor be of ani use to him who ha not learn how to handl them and ha 
never bestow ani attent upon them how then will he who take up 
a shield or other implement of war becom a good fighter all in a day 
whether with heavi arm or ani other kind of troop 

ye he said the tool which would teach men their own use would be 
beyond price 

and the higher the duti of the guardian i said the more time and 
skill and art and applic will be need by him 

no doubt he repli 

will he not also requir natur aptitud for hi call 

certainli 

then it will be our duti to select if we can natur which are fit 
for the task of guard the citi 

it will 

and the select will be no easi matter i said but we must be brave 
and do our best 

we must 

is not the nobl youth veri like a well bred dog in respect of guard 
and watch 

what do you mean 

i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtak 
the enemi when they see him and strong too if when they have caught 
him they have to fight with him 

all these qualiti he repli will certainli be requir by them 

well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 

certainli 

and is he like to be brave who ha no spirit whether hor or dog 
or ani other anim have you never observ how invinc and 
unconqu is spirit and how the presenc of it make the soul of ani 
creatur to be absolut fearless and indomit 

i have 

then now we have a clear notion of the bodili qualiti which are 
requir in the guardian 

true 

and also of the mental one hi soul is to be full of spirit 

ye 

but are not these spirit natur apt to be savag with one anoth 
and with everybodi el 

a difficulti by no mean easi to overcom he repli 

wherea i said they ought to be danger to their enemi and gentl 
to their friend if not they will destroy themselv without wait 
for their enemi to destroy them 

true he said 

what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentl natur which 
ha also a great spirit for the one is the contradict of the other 

true 

he will not be a good guardian who is want in either of these two 
qualiti and yet the combin of them appear to be imposs and 
henc we must infer that to be a good guardian is imposs 

i am afraid that what you say is true he repli 

here feel perplex i began to think over what had prece my 
friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplex for we have lost 
sight of the imag which we had befor u 

what do you mean he said 

i mean to say that there do exist natur gift with those opposit 
qualiti 

and where do you find them 

mani anim i repli furnish exampl of them our friend the dog 
is a veri good one you know that well bred dog are perfectli gentl to 
their familiar and acquaint and the rever to stranger 

ye i know 

then there is noth imposs or out of the order of natur in our 
find a guardian who ha a similar combin of qualiti 

certainli not 

would not he who is fit to be a guardian besid the spirit 
natur need to have the qualiti of a philosoph 

i do not apprehend your mean 

the trait of which i am speak i repli may be also seen in the 
dog and is remark in the anim 

what trait 

whi a dog whenev he see a stranger is angri when an acquaint 
he welcom him although the one ha never done him ani harm nor the 
other ani good did thi never strike you a curiou 

the matter never struck me befor but i quit recogni the truth of 
your remark 

and sure thi instinct of the dog is veri charm your dog is a 
true philosoph 

whi 

whi becau he distinguish the face of a friend and of an enemi onli 
by the criterion of know and not know and must not an anim be a 
lover of learn who determin what he like and dislik by the test 
of knowledg and ignor 

most assuredli 

and is not the love of learn the love of wisdom which is philosophi 

they are the same he repli 

and may we not say confid of man also that he who is like to be 
gentl to hi friend and acquaint must by natur be a lover of 
wisdom and knowledg 

that we may safe affirm 

then he who is to be a realli good and nobl guardian of the state will 
requir to unit in himself philosophi and spirit and swift and 
strength 

undoubtedli 

then we have found the desir natur and now that we have found them 
how are they to be rear and educ is not thi an enquiri which 
may be expect to throw light on the greater enquiri which is our final 
end how do justic and injust grow up in state for we do not want 
either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an 
inconveni length 

adeimantu thought that the enquiri would be of great servic to u 

then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if 
somewhat long 

certainli not 

come then and let u pa a leisur hour in stori tell and our 
stori shall be the educ of our hero 

by all mean 

and what shall be their educ can we find a better than the 
tradit sort and thi ha two divi gymnast for the bodi 
and music for the soul 

true 

shall we begin educ with music and go on to gymnast afterward 

by all mean 

and when you speak of music do you includ literatur or not 

i do 

and literatur may be either true or fal 

ye 

and the young should be train in both kind and we begin with the 
fal 

i do not understand your mean he said 

you know i said that we begin by tell child stori which 
though not wholli destitut of truth are in the main fictiti 
and these stori are told them when they are not of an age to learn 
gymnast 

veri true 

that wa my mean when i said that we must teach music befor 
gymnast 

quit right he said 

you know also that the begin is the most import part of ani work 
especi in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time 
at which the charact is be form and the desir impress is 
more readili taken 

quit true 

and shall we just carelessli allow child to hear ani casual tale 
which may be devi by casual person and to receiv into their mind 
idea for the most part the veri opposit of those which we should wish 
them to have when they are grown up 

we cannot 

then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writer of 
fiction and let the censor receiv ani tale of fiction which is good 
and reject the bad and we will desir mother and nur to tell their 
child the authori one onli let them fashion the mind with such 
tale even more fondli than they mould the bodi with their hand but 
most of those which are now in use must be discard 

of what tale are you speak he said 

you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are 
necessarili of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of 
them 

veri like he repli but i do not a yet know what you would term 
the greater 

those i said which are narrat by homer and hesiod and the rest of 
the poet who have ever been the great stori teller of mankind 

but which stori do you mean he said and what fault do you find with 
them 

a fault which is most seriou i said the fault of tell a lie and 
what is more a bad lie 

but when is thi fault commit 

whenev an erron repres is made of the natur of god and 
hero a when a painter paint a portrait not have the shadow of a 
like to the origin 

ye he said that sort of thing is certainli veri blameabl but what 
are the stori which you mean 

first of all i said there wa that greatest of all lie in high 
place which the poet told about uranu and which wa a bad lie 
too i mean what hesiod say that uranu did and how cronu retali 
on him the do of cronu and the suffer which in turn hi son 
inflict upon him even if they were true ought certainli not to be 
lightli told to young and thoughtless person if possibl they had 
better be buri in silenc but if there is an absolut necess 
for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mysteri and 
they should sacrif not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and 
unprocur victim and then the number of the hearer will be veri few 
ind 

whi ye said he those stori are extrem object 

ye adeimantu they are stori not to be repeat in our state the 
young man should not be told that in commit the worst of crime he 
is far from do anyth outrag and that even if he chasti hi 
father when he doe wrong in whatev manner he will onli be follow 
the exampl of the first and greatest among the god 

i entir agr with you he said in my opinion those stori are 
quit unfit to be repeat 

neither if we mean our futur guardian to regard the habit of 
quarrel among themselv a of all thing the basest should 
ani word be said to them of the war in heaven and of the plot and 
fight of the god against one anoth for they are not true no 
we shall never mention the battl of the giant or let them be 
embroid on garment and we shall be silent about the innum 
other quarrel of god and hero with their friend and rel 
if they would onli believ u we would tell them that quarrel 
is unholi and that never up to thi time ha there been ani quarrel 
between citizen thi is what old men and old woman should begin by 
tell child and when they grow up the poet also should be told 
to compo for them in a similar spirit but the narr of hephaestu 
bind here hi mother or how on anoth occa zeu sent him fli 
for take her part when she wa be beaten and all the battl of 
the god in homer these tale must not be admit into our state 
whether they are suppo to have an allegor mean or not for 
a young person cannot judg what is allegor and what is liter 
anyth that he receiv into hi mind at that age is like to becom 
indel and unalt and therefor it is most import that the 
tale which the young first hear should be model of virtuou thought 

there you are right he repli but if ani one ask where are such 
model to be found and of what tale are you speak how shall we 
answer him 

i said to him you and i adeimantu at thi moment are not poet 
but founder of a state now the founder of a state ought to know the 
gener form in which poet should cast their tale and the limit 
which must be observ by them but to make the tale is not their 
busi 

veri true he said but what are these form of theolog which you mean 

someth of thi kind i repli god is alway to be repr a 
he truli is whatev be the sort of poetri epic lyric or tragic in 
which the repres is given 

right 

and is he not truli good and must he not be repr a such 

certainli 

and no good thing is hurt 

no ind 

and that which is not hurt hurt not 

certainli not 

and that which hurt not doe no evil 

no 

and can that which doe no evil be a cau of evil 

imposs 

and the good is advantag 

ye 

and therefor the cau of well be 

ye 

it follow therefor that the good is not the cau of all thing but 
of the good onli 

assuredli 

then god if he be good is not the author of all thing a the mani 
assert but he is the cau of a few thing onli and not of most thing 
that occur to men for few are the good of human life and mani are the 
evil and the good is to be attribut to god alon of the evil the 
cau are to be sought elsewh and not in him 

that appear to me to be most true he said 

then we must not listen to homer or to ani other poet who is guilti of 
the folli of say that two cask 

lie at the threshold of zeu full of lot one of good the other of 
evil lot 

and that he to whom zeu give a mixtur of the two 

sometim meet with evil fortun at other time with good 

but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingl ill 

him wild hunger drive o er the beauteou earth 

and again 

zeu who is the dispen of good and evil to u 

and if ani one assert that the violat of oath and treati which 
wa realli the work of pandaru wa brought about by athen and zeu 
or that the strife and content of the god wa instig by themi 
and zeu he shall not have our approv neither will we allow our 
young men to hear the word of aeschylu that 

god plant guilt among men when he desir utterli to destroy a hou 

and if a poet write of the suffer of niob the subject of the 
tragedi in which these iambic ver occur or of the hou of pelop 
or of the trojan war or on ani similar theme either we must not permit 
him to say that these are the work of god or if they are of god he 
must devi some explan of them such a we are seek he must say 
that god did what wa just and right and they were the better for be 
punish but that those who are punish are miser and that god 
is the author of their miseri the poet is not to be permit to say 
though he may say that the wick are miser becau they requir 
to be punish and are benefit by receiv punish from god 
but that god be good is the author of evil to ani one is to be 
strenuou deni and not to be said or sung or heard in ver or 
prose by ani one whether old or young in ani well order commonwealth 
such a fiction is suicid ruinou impiou 

i agr with you he repli and am readi to give my assent to the law 

let thi then be one of our rule and principl concern the god to 
which our poet and recit will be expect to conform that god is 
not the author of all thing but of good onli 

that will do he said 

and what do you think of a second principl shall i ask you whether god 
is a magician and of a natur to appear insidi now in one shape 
and now in anoth sometim himself chang and pa into 
mani form sometim deceiv u with the semblanc of such 
transform or is he one and the same immut fix in hi own 
proper imag 

i cannot answer you he said without more thought 

well i said but if we suppo a chang in anyth that chang must 
be effect either by the thing itself or by some other thing 

most certainli 

and thing which are at their best are also least liabl to be alter 
or discompo for exampl when healthiest and strongest the human 
frame is least liabl to be affect by meat and drink and the plant 
which is in the fullest vigour also suffer least from wind or the heat 
of the sun or ani similar cau 

of cour 

and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confu or derang 
by ani extern influenc 

true 

and the same principl a i should suppo appli to all composit 
thing furnitur hou garment when good and well made they are 
least alter by time and circumst 

veri true 

then everyth which is good whether made by art or natur or both 
is least liabl to suffer chang from without 

true 

but sure god and the thing of god are in everi way perfect 

of cour they are 

then he can hardli be compel by extern influenc to take mani 
shape 

he cannot 

but may he not chang and transform himself 

clearli he said that must be the case if he is chang at all 

and will he then chang himself for the better and fairer or for the 
wor and more unsightli 

if he chang at all he can onli chang for the wor for we cannot 
suppo him to be defici either in virtu or beauti 

veri true adeimantu but then would ani one whether god or man 
desir to make himself wor 

imposs 

then it is imposs that god should ever be will to chang be 
a is suppo the fairest and best that is conceiv everi god 
remain absolut and for ever in hi own form 

that necessarili follow he said in my judgment 

then i said my dear friend let none of the poet tell u that 

the god take the disgui of stranger from other land walk up 
and down citi in all sort of form 

and let no one slander proteu and theti neither let ani one either 
in tragedi or in ani other kind of poetri introduc here disgui in 
the like of a priestess ask an alm 

for the life give daughter of inachu the river of argo 

let u have no more lie of that sort neither must we have mother 
under the influenc of the poet scare their child with a bad 
version of these myth tell how certain god a they say go about 
by night in the like of so mani stranger and in diver form but 
let them take heed lest they make coward of their child and at the 
same time speak blasphemi against the god 

heaven forbid he said 

but although the god are themselv unchang still by witchcraft 
and decept they may make u think that they appear in variou form 

perhap he repli 

well but can you imagin that god will be will to lie whether in 
word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 

i cannot say he repli 

do you not know i said that the true lie if such an express may be 
allow is hate of god and men 

what do you mean he said 

i mean that no one is willingli deceiv in that which is the truest and 
highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matter there 
abov all he is most afraid of a lie have poss of him 

still he said i do not comprehend you 

the reason is i repli that you attribut some profound mean to 
my word but i am onli say that decept or be deceiv 
or uninform about the highest realiti in the highest part of 
themselv which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to 
hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they 
utterli detest 

there is noth more hate to them 

and a i wa just now remark thi ignor in the soul of him who 
is deceiv may be call the true lie for the lie in word is onli a 
kind of imit and shadowi imag of a previou affect of the soul 
not pure unadult falsehood am i not right 

perfectli right 

the true lie is hate not onli by the god but also by men 

ye 

wherea the lie in word is in certain case use and not hate in 
deal with enemi that would be an instanc or again when those 
whom we call our friend in a fit of mad or illu are go to 
do some harm then it is use and is a sort of medicin or 
prevent also in the tale of mytholog of which we were just now 
speak becau we do not know the truth about ancient time we make 
falsehood a much like truth a we can and so turn it to account 

veri true he said 

but can ani of these reason appli to god can we suppo that he is 
ignor of antiqu and therefor ha recour to invent 

that would be ridicul he said 

then the lie poet ha no place in our idea of god 

i should say not 

or perhap he may tell a lie becau he is afraid of enemi 

that is inconceiv 

but he may have friend who are senseless or mad 

but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 

then no motiv can be imagin whi god should lie 

none whatev 

then the superhuman and divin is absolut incap of falsehood 

ye 

then is god perfectli simpl and true both in word and deed he chang 
not he deceiv not either by sign or word by dream or wake vision 

your thought he said are the reflect of my own 

you agr with me then i said that thi is the second type or form in 
which we should write and speak about divin thing the god are not 
magician who transform themselv neither do they deceiv mankind in 
ani way 

i grant that 

then although we are admir of homer we do not admir the lie 
dream which zeu send to agamemnon neither will we prai the ver 
of aeschylu in which theti say that apollo at her nuptial 

wa celebr in song her fair progeni whose day were to be long 
and to know no sick and when he had spoken of my lot a in all 
thing bless of heaven he rai a note of triumph and cheer my 
soul and i thought that the word of phoebu be divin and full of 
propheci would not fail and now he himself who utter the strain 
he who wa present at the banquet and who said thi he it is who ha 
slain my son 

these are the kind of sentiment about the god which will arou our 
anger and he who utter them shall be refu a choru neither shall 
we allow teacher to make use of them in the instruct of the young 
mean a we do that our guardian a far a men can be should be 
true worshipp of the god and like them 

i entir agr he said in these principl and promi to make them 
my law 




book iii 

such then i said are our principl of theolog some tale are to be 
told and other are not to be told to our discipl from their youth 
upward if we mean them to honour the god and their parent and to 
valu friendship with one anoth 

ye and i think that our principl are right he said 

but if they are to be courag must they not learn other lesson 
besid these and lesson of such a kind a will take away the fear of 
death can ani man be courag who ha the fear of death in him 

certainli not he said 

and can he be fearless of death or will he choo death in battl 
rather than defeat and slaveri who belief the world below to be real 
and terribl 

imposs 

then we must assum a control over the narrat of thi class of tale 
a well a over the other and beg them not simpli to revil but rather 
to commend the world below intim to them that their descript 
are untru and will do harm to our futur warrior 

that will be our duti he said 

then i said we shall have to oblit mani obnoxi passag 
begin with the ver 

i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than 
rule over all the dead who have come to nought 

we must also expung the ver which tell u how pluto fear 

lest the mansion grim and squalid which the god abhor should be seen 
both of mortal and immort 

and again 

o heaven verili in the hou of hade there is soul and ghostli form 
but no mind at all 

again of tiresia 

to him even after death did persephon grant mind that he alon 
should be wise but the other soul are flit shade 

again 

the soul fli from the limb had gone to hade lament her fate 
leav manhood and youth 

again 

and the soul with shrill cri pa like smoke beneath the earth 

and 

a bat in hollow of mystic cavern whenev ani of them ha drop 
out of the string and fall from the rock fli shrill and cling 
to one anoth so did they with shrill cri hold togeth a they 
move 

and we must beg homer and the other poet not to be angri if we strike 
out these and similar passag not becau they are unpoet or 
unattract to the popular ear but becau the greater the poetic 
charm of them the le are they meet for the ear of boy and men who 
are meant to be free and who should fear slaveri more than death 

undoubtedli 

also we shall have to reject all the terribl and appal name which 
describ the world below cocytu and styx ghost under the earth and 
sapless shade and ani similar word of which the veri mention cau a 
shudder to pa through the inmost soul of him who hear them i do not 
say that these horribl stori may not have a use of some kind but 
there is a danger that the nerv of our guardian may be render too 
excit and effemin by them 

there is a real danger he said 

then we must have no more of them 

true 

anoth and a nobler strain must be compo and sung by u 

clearli 

and shall we proceed to get rid of the weep and wail of famou 
men 

they will go with the rest 

but shall we be right in get rid of them reflect our principl is 
that the good man will not consid death terribl to ani other good man 
who is hi comrad 

ye that is our principl 

and therefor he will not sorrow for hi depart friend a though he 
had suffer anyth terribl 

he will not 

such an one a we further maintain is suffici for himself and hi 
own happi and therefor is least in need of other men 

true he said 

and for thi reason the loss of a son or brother or the depriv of 
fortun is to him of all men least terribl 

assuredli 

and therefor he will be least like to lament and will bear with the 
greatest equanim ani misfortun of thi sort which may befal him 

ye he will feel such a misfortun far le than anoth 

then we shall be right in get rid of the lament of famou men 
and make them over to woman and not even to woman who are good for 
anyth or to men of a baser sort that those who are be educ 
by u to be the defend of their countri may scorn to do the like 

that will be veri right 

then we will onc more entreat homer and the other poet not to depict 
achil who is the son of a goddess first lie on hi side then on 
hi back and then on hi face then start up and sail in a frenzi 
along the shore of the barren sea now take the sooti ash in both 
hi hand and pour them over hi head or weep and wail in the 
variou mode which homer ha delin nor should he describ priam 
the kinsman of the god a pray and beseech 

roll in the dirt call each man loudli by hi name 

still more earnestli will we beg of him at all event not to introduc 
the god lament and say 

ala my miseri ala that i bore the bravest to my sorrow 

but if he must introduc the god at ani rate let him not dare so 
complet to misrepr the greatest of the god a to make him 
say 

o heaven with my eye verili i behold a dear friend of mine chase 
round and round the citi and my heart is sorrow 

or again 

woe is me that i am fate to have sarpedon dearest of men to me 
subdu at the hand of patroclu the son of menoetiu 

for if my sweet adeimantu our youth seriou listen to such unworthi 
repres of the god instead of laugh at them a they ought 
hardli will ani of them deem that he himself be but a man can be 
dishonour by similar action neither will he rebuk ani inclin 
which may ari in hi mind to say and do the like and instead 
of have ani shame or self control he will be alway whine and 
lament on slight occa 

ye he said that is most true 

ye i repli but that sure is what ought not to be a the argument 
ha just prove to u and by that proof we must abid until it is 
disprov by a better 

it ought not to be 

neither ought our guardian to be given to laughter for a fit of 
laughter which ha been indulg to excess almost alway produc a 
violent reaction 

so i believ 

then person of worth even if onli mortal men must not be repr 
a overcom by laughter and still le must such a repres of 
the god be allow 

still le of the god a you say he repli 

then we shall not suffer such an express to be use about the god a 
that of homer when he describ how 

inextinguish laughter aro among the bless god when they saw 
hephaestu bustl about the mansion 

on your view we must not admit them 

on my view if you like to father them on me that we must not admit 
them is certain 

again truth should be highli valu if a we were say a lie is 
useless to the god and use onli a a medicin to men then the 
use of such medicin should be restrict to physician privat 
individu have no busi with them 

clearli not he said 

then if ani one at all is to have the privileg of lie the ruler of 
the state should be the person and they in their deal either with 
enemi or with their own citizen may be allow to lie for the public 
good but nobodi el should meddl with anyth of the kind and 
although the ruler have thi privileg for a privat man to lie to 
them in return is to be deem a more heinou fault than for the patient 
or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about hi own bodili 
ill to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to 
tell the captain what is happen about the ship and the rest of the 
crew and how thing are go with himself or hi fellow sailor 

most true he said 

if then the ruler catch anybodi besid himself lie in the state 

ani of the craftsman whether he be priest or physician or carpent 

he will punish him for introduc a practic which is equal 
subver and destruct of ship or state 

most certainli he said if our idea of the state is ever carri out 

in the next place our youth must be temper 

certainli 

are not the chief element of temper speak gener obedi 
to command and self control in sensual pleasur 

true 

then we shall approv such languag a that of diom in homer 

friend sit still and obey my word 

and the ver which follow 

the greek march breath prowess in silent awe of their 
leader 

and other sentiment of the same kind 

we shall 

what of thi line 

o heavi with wine who hast the eye of a dog and the heart of a stag 

and of the word which follow would you say that these or ani similar 
impertin which privat individu are suppo to address to their 
ruler whether in ver or prose are well or ill spoken 

they are ill spoken 

they may veri possibl afford some amu but they do not conduc 
to temper and therefor they are like to do harm to our young 
men you would agr with me there 

ye 

and then again to make the wisest of men say that noth in hi 
opinion is more gloriou than 

when the tabl are full of bread and meat and the cup bearer carri 
round wine which he draw from the bowl and pour into the cup 

is it fit or conduc to temper for a young man to hear such word 
or the ver 

the saddest of fate is to die and meet destini from hunger 

what would you say again to the tale of zeu who while other god and 
men were asleep and he the onli person awak lay devi plan but 
forgot them all in a moment through hi lust and wa so complet 
overcom at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut 
but want to lie with her on the ground declar that he had never 
been in such a state of raptur befor even when they first met one 
anoth 

without the knowledg of their parent 

or that other tale of how hephaestu becau of similar go on cast 
a chain around are and aphrodit 

ind he said i am strongli of opinion that they ought not to hear 
that sort of thing 

but ani deed of endur which are done or told by famou men these 
they ought to see and hear a for exampl what is said in the ver 

he smote hi breast and thu reproach hi heart endur my heart 
far wor hast thou endur 

certainli he said 

in the next place we must not let them be receiv of gift or lover 
of money 

certainli not 

neither must we sing to them of 

gift persuad god and persuad reverend king 

neither is phoenix the tutor of achil to be approv or deem to 
have given hi pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take 
the gift of the greek and assist them but that without a gift he 
should not lay asid hi anger neither will we believ or acknowledg 
achil himself to have been such a lover of money that he took 
agamemnon s gift or that when he had receiv payment he restor the 
dead bodi of hector but that without payment he wa unwil to do so 

undoubtedli he said these are not sentiment which can be approv 

love homer a i do i hardli like to say that in attribut these 
feel to achil or in believ that they are truli attribut 
to him he is guilti of downright impieti a littl can i believ the 
narr of hi insol to apollo where he say 

thou hast wrong me o far darter most abomin of deiti verili 
i would be even with thee if i had onli the power 

or hi insubordin to the river god on whose divin he is readi 
to lay hand or hi offer to the dead patroclu of hi own hair 
which had been previou dedic to the other river god spercheiu 
and that he actual perform thi vow or that he drag hector round 
the tomb of patroclu and slaughter the captiv at the pyre of all 
thi i cannot believ that he wa guilti ani more than i can allow 
our citizen to believ that he the wise cheiron s pupil the son of a 
goddess and of peleu who wa the gentlest of men and third in descent 
from zeu wa so disord in hi wit a to be at one time the slave 
of two seemingli inconsist passion mean not untaint by 
avar combin with overween contempt of god and men 

you are quit right he repli 

and let u equal refu to believ or allow to be repeat the tale 
of theseu son of poseidon or of peirith son of zeu go forth a 
they did to perpetr a horrid rape or of ani other hero or son of 
a god dare to do such impiou and dread thing a they fal 
ascrib to them in our day and let u further compel the poet to 
declar either that these act were not done by them or that they 
were not the son of god both in the same breath they shall not be 
permit to affirm we will not have them tri to persuad our youth 
that the god are the author of evil and that hero are no better 
than men sentiment which a we were say are neither piou nor 
true for we have alreadi prove that evil cannot come from the god 

assuredli not 

and further they are like to have a bad effect on those who hear them 
for everybodi will begin to excu hi own vice when he is convinc 
that similar wick are alway be perpetr by 

the kindr of the god the rel of zeu whose ancestr altar 
the altar of zeu is aloft in air on the peak of ida 

and who have 

the blood of deiti yet flow in their vein 

and therefor let u put an end to such tale lest they engend laxiti 
of moral among the young 

by all mean he repli 

but now that we are determin what class of subject are or are not 
to be spoken of let u see whether ani have been omit by u the 
manner in which god and demigod and hero and the world below should 
be treat ha been alreadi laid down 

veri true 

and what shall we say about men that is clearli the remain portion 
of our subject 

clearli so 

but we are not in a condit to answer thi question at present my 
friend 

whi not 

becau if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poet 
and stori teller are guilti of make the gravest misstat when 
they tell u that wick men are often happi and the good miser 
and that injust is profit when undetect but that justic is a 
man s own loss and anoth s gain these thing we shall forbid them to 
utter and command them to sing and say the opposit 

to be sure we shall he repli 

but if you admit that i am right in thi then i shall maintain that you 
have impli the principl for which we have been all along contend 

i grant the truth of your infer 

that such thing are or are not to be said about men is a question which 
we cannot determin until we have discov what justic is and how 
natur advantag to the possessor whether he seem to be just or 
not 

most true he said 

enough of the subject of poetri let u now speak of the style and 
when thi ha been consid both matter and manner will have been 
complet treat 

i do not understand what you mean said adeimantu 

then i must make you understand and perhap i may be more intellig 
if i put the matter in thi way you are awar i suppo that all 
mytholog and poetri is a narrat of event either past present or 
to come 

certainli he repli 

and narrat may be either simpl narrat or imit or a union 
of the two 

that again he said i do not quit understand 

i fear that i must be a ridicul teacher when i have so much 
difficulti in make myself apprehend like a bad speaker therefor 
i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piec off in 
illustr of my mean you know the first line of the iliad 
in which the poet say that chryse pray agamemnon to relea hi 
daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon 
chryse fail of hi object invok the anger of the god against the 
achaean now a far a these line 

and he pray all the greek but especi the two son of atreu 
the chief of the peopl 

the poet is speak in hi own person he never lead u to suppo 
that he is ani one el but in what follow he take the person of 
chryse and then he doe all that he can to make u believ that the 
speaker is not homer but the age priest himself and in thi doubl 
form he ha cast the entir narr of the event which occur at 
troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 

ye 

and a narr it remain both in the speech which the poet recit 
from time to time and in the intermedi passag 

quit true 

but when the poet speak in the person of anoth may we not say that 
he assimil hi style to that of the person who a he inform you 
is go to speak 

certainli 

and thi assimil of himself to anoth either by the use of voic 
or gestur is the imit of the person whose charact he assum 

of cour 

then in thi case the narr of the poet may be said to proceed by 
way of imit 

veri true 

or if the poet everywh appear and never conceal himself then 
again the imit is drop and hi poetri becom simpl narrat 
howev in order that i may make my mean quit clear and that you 
may no more say i don t understand i will show how the chang might 
be effect if homer had said the priest came have hi daughter s 
ransom in hi hand supplic the achaean and abov all the 
king and then if instead of speak in the person of chryse 
he had continu in hi own person the word would have been not 
imit but simpl narrat the passag would have run a follow 
i am no poet and therefor i drop the metr the priest came and 
pray the god on behalf of the greek that they might captur troy 
and return safe home but beg that they would give him back hi 
daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god 
thu he spoke and the other greek rever the priest and assent but 
agamemnon wa wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the 
staff and chaplet of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter 
of chryse should not be relea he said she should grow old with him 
in argo and then he told him to go away and not to provok him if he 
intend to get home unscath and the old man went away in fear and 
silenc and when he had left the camp he call upon apollo by hi 
mani name remind him of everyth which he had done plea to 
him whether in build hi templ or in offer sacrif and 
pray that hi good deed might be return to him and that the 
achaean might expiat hi tear by the arrow of the god and so on 
in thi way the whole becom simpl narr 

i understand he said 

or you may suppo the opposit case that the intermedi passag are 
omit and the dialogu onli left 

that also he said i understand you mean for exampl a in tragedi 

you have conceiv my mean perfectli and if i mistak not what you 
fail to apprehend befor is now made clear to you that poetri and 
mytholog are in some case wholli imit instanc of thi are 
suppli by tragedi and comedi there is likewi the opposit style 
in which the poet is the onli speaker of thi the dithyramb afford 
the best exampl and the combin of both is found in epic and in 
sever other style of poetri do i take you with me 

ye he said i see now what you meant 

i will ask you to rememb also what i began by say that we had done 
with the subject and might proceed to the style 

ye i rememb 

in say thi i intend to impli that we must come to an 
understand about the mimet art whether the poet in narrat 
their stori are to be allow by u to imit and if so whether 
in whole or in part and if the latter in what part or should all 
imit be prohibit 

you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedi and comedi shall be admit 
into our state 

ye i said but there may be more than thi in question i realli do 
not know a yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 

and go we will he said 

then adeimantu let me ask you whether our guardian ought to be 
imit or rather ha not thi question been decid by the rule 
alreadi laid down that one man can onli do one thing well and not mani 
and that if he attempt mani he will altogeth fail of gain much 
reput in ani 

certainli 

and thi is equal true of imit no one man can imit mani 
thing a well a he would imit a singl one 

he cannot 

then the same person will hardli be abl to play a seriou part in life 
and at the same time to be an imit and imit mani other part a 
well for even when two speci of imit are nearli alli the same 
person cannot succeed in both a for exampl the writer of tragedi 
and comedi did you not just now call them imit 

ye i did and you are right in think that the same person cannot 
succeed in both 

ani more than they can be rhapsodist and actor at onc 

true 

neither are comic and tragic actor the same yet all these thing are 
but imit 

they are so 

and human natur adeimantu appear to have been coin into yet 
smaller piec and to be a incap of imit mani thing well a 
of perform well the action of which the imit are copi 

quit true he repli 

if then we adher to our origin notion and bear in mind that 
our guardian set asid everi other busi are to dedic 
themselv wholli to the mainten of freedom in the state make 
thi their craft and engag in no work which doe not bear on thi 
end they ought not to practi or imit anyth el if they 
imit at all they should imit from youth upward onli those 
charact which are suitabl to their profess the courag 
temper holi free and the like but they should not depict or be 
skil at imit ani kind of illib or base lest from 
imit they should come to be what they imit did you never 
observ how imit begin in earli youth and continu far into 
life at length grow into habit and becom a second natur affect 
bodi voic and mind 

ye certainli he said 

then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of 
whom we say that they ought to be good men to imit a woman whether 
young or old quarrel with her husband or strive and vaunt 
against the god in conceit of her happi or when she is in 
afflict or sorrow or weep and certainli not one who is in 
sick love or labour 

veri right he said 

neither must they repr slave male or femal perform the 
offic of slave 

they must not 

and sure not bad men whether coward or ani other who do the 
rever of what we have just been prescrib who scold or mock or 
revil one anoth in drink or out of drink or who in ani other manner 
sin against themselv and their neighbour in word or deed a the 
manner of such is neither should they be train to imit the action 
or speech of men or woman who are mad or bad for mad like vice is 
to be known but not to be practi or imit 

veri true he repli 

neither may they imit smith or other artif or oarsman or 
boatswain or the like 

how can they he said when they are not allow to appli their mind to 
the call of ani of these 

nor may they imit the neigh of hor the bellow of bull the 
murmur of river and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of 
thing 

nay he said if mad be forbidden neither may they copi the 
behaviour of madman 

you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of 
narr style which may be employ by a truli good man when he ha 
anyth to say and that anoth sort will be use by a man of an 
opposit charact and educ 

and which are these two sort he ask 

suppo i answer that a just and good man in the cour of a 
narrat come on some say or action of anoth good man i should 
imagin that he will like to person him and will not be asham of 
thi sort of imit he will be most readi to play the part of the 
good man when he is act firmli and wise in a le degr when 
he is overtaken by ill or love or drink or ha met with ani other 
disast but when he come to a charact which is unworthi of him he 
will not make a studi of that he will disdain such a person and will 
assum hi like if at all for a moment onli when he is perform 
some good action at other time he will be asham to play a part which 
he ha never practi nor will he like to fashion and frame himself 
after the baser model he feel the employ of such an art unless 
in jest to be beneath him and hi mind revolt at it 

so i should expect he repli 

then he will adopt a mode of narrat such a we have illustr 
out of homer that is to say hi style will be both imit and 
narr but there will be veri littl of the former and a great deal 
of the latter do you agr 

certainli he said that is the model which such a speaker must 
necessarili take 

but there is anoth sort of charact who will narrat anyth and 
the wor he is the more unscrupul he will be noth will be too 
bad for him and he will be readi to imit anyth not a a joke 
but in right good earnest and befor a larg compani a i wa just now 
say he will attempt to repr the roll of thunder the noi of 
wind and hail or the creak of wheel and pulley and the variou 
sound of flute pipe trumpet and all sort of instrument he will 
bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock hi entir art 
will consist in imit of voic and gestur and there will be veri 
littl narrat 

that he said will be hi mode of speak 

these then are the two kind of style 

ye 

and you would agr with me in say that one of them is simpl and ha 
but slight chang and if the harmoni and rhythm are also chosen 
for their simplic the result is that the speaker if he speak 
correctli is alway pretti much the same in style and he will keep 
within the limit of a singl harmoni for the chang are not great 
and in like manner he will make use of nearli the same rhythm 

that is quit true he said 

wherea the other requir all sort of harmoni and all sort of 
rhythm if the music and the style are to correspond becau the style 
ha all sort of chang 

that is also perfectli true he repli 

and do not the two style or the mixtur of the two comprehend all 
poetri and everi form of express in word no one can say anyth 
except in one or other of them or in both togeth 

they includ all he said 

and shall we receiv into our state all the three style or one onli of 
the two unmix style or would you includ the mix 

i should prefer onli to admit the pure imit of virtu 

ye i said adeimantu but the mix style is also veri charm and 
ind the pantomim which is the opposit of the one chosen by you 
is the most popular style with child and their attend and with 
the world in gener 

i do not deni it 

but i suppo you would argu that such a style is unsuit to our 
state in which human natur is not twofold or manifold for one man 
play one part onli 

ye quit unsuit 

and thi is the reason whi in our state and in our state onli we 
shall find a shoemak to be a shoemak and not a pilot also and a 
husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a 
soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 

true he said 

and therefor when ani one of these pantomim gentleman who are so 
clever that they can imit anyth come to u and make a propo 
to exhibit himself and hi poetri we will fall down and worship him a 
a sweet and holi and wonder be but we must also inform him that 
in our state such a he are not permit to exist the law will not 
allow them and so when we have anoint him with myrrh and set a 
garland of wool upon hi head we shall send him away to anoth citi 
for we mean to employ for our soul health the rougher and sever poet 
or stori teller who will imit the style of the virtuou onli and 
will follow those model which we prescrib at first when we began the 
educ of our soldier 

we certainli will he said if we have the power 

then now my friend i said that part of music or literari educ 
which relat to the stori or myth may be consid to be finish for 
the matter and manner have both been discu 

i think so too he said 

next in order will follow melodi and song 

that is obviou 

everi one can see alreadi what we ought to say about them if we are to 
be consist with ourselv 

i fear said glaucon laugh that the word everi one hardli 
includ me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though 
i may guess 

at ani rate you can tell that a song or ode ha three part the word 
the melodi and the rhythm that degr of knowledg i may presuppo 

ye he said so much a that you may 

and a for the word there will sure be no differ between word 
which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same 
law and these have been alreadi determin by u 

ye 

and the melodi and rhythm will depend upon the word 

certainli 

we were say when we spoke of the subject matter that we had no need 
of lament and strain of sorrow 

true 

and which are the harmoni express of sorrow you are music and 
can tell me 

the harmoni which you mean are the mix or tenor lydian and the 
full tone or bass lydian and such like 

these then i said must be banish even to woman who have a charact 
to maintain they are of no use and much le to men 

certainli 

in the next place drunken and soft and indol are utterli 
unbecom the charact of our guardian 

utterli unbecom 

and which are the soft or drink harmoni 

the ionian he repli and the lydian they are term relax 

well and are these of ani militari use 

quit the rever he repli and if so the dorian and the phrygian are 
the onli one which you have left 

i answer of the harmoni i know noth but i want to have one 
warlik to sound the note or accent which a brave man utter in the 
hour of danger and stern resolv or when hi cau is fail and he 
is go to wound or death or is overtaken by some other evil and 
at everi such crisi meet the blow of fortun with firm step and a 
determin to endur and anoth to be use by him in time of peac 
and freedom of action when there is no pressur of necess and he is 
seek to persuad god by prayer or man by instruct and admonit 
or on the other hand when he is express hi will to yield to 
persua or entreati or admonit and which repr him when 
by prudent conduct he ha attain hi end not carri away by hi 
success but act moder and wise under the circumst and 
acquiesc in the event these two harmoni i ask you to leav 
the strain of necess and the strain of freedom the strain of the 
unfortun and the strain of the fortun the strain of courag and 
the strain of temper these i say leav 

and these he repli are the dorian and phrygian harmoni of which i 
wa just now speak 

then i said if these and these onli are to be use in our song and 
melodi we shall not want multipl of note or a panharmon 
scale 

i suppo not 

then we shall not maintain the artif of lyre with three 
corner and complex scale or the maker of ani other mani string 
curiou harmoni instrument 

certainli not 

but what do you say to flute maker and flute player would you admit 
them into our state when you reflect that in thi composit use of 
harmoni the flute is wor than all the string instrument put 
togeth even the panharmon music is onli an imit of the flute 

clearli not 

there remain then onli the lyre and the harp for use in the citi and 
the shepherd may have a pipe in the countri 

that is sure the conclu to be drawn from the argument 

the prefer of apollo and hi instrument to marsya and hi 
instrument is not at all strang i said 

not at all he repli 

and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsci purg the 
state which not long ago we term luxuri 

and we have done wise he repli 

then let u now finish the purgat i said next in order to 
harmoni rhythm will natur follow and they should be subject to 
the same rule for we ought not to seek out complex system of metr 
or metr of everi kind but rather to discov what rhythm are the 
express of a courag and harmoni life and when we have found 
them we shall adapt the foot and the melodi to word have a like 
spirit not the word to the foot and melodi to say what these rhythm 
are will be your duti you must teach me them a you have alreadi 
taught me the harmoni 

but ind he repli i cannot tell you i onli know that there 
are some three principl of rhythm out of which metric system are 
frame just a in sound there are four note i e the four note of 
the tetrachord out of which all the harmoni are compo that is 
an observ which i have made but of what sort of life they are 
sever the imit i am unabl to say 

then i said we must take damon into our counsel and he will tell u 
what rhythm are express of mean or insol or furi or other 
unworthi and what are to be reserv for the express of opposit 
feel and i think that i have an indistinct recollect of hi 
mention a complex cretic rhythm also a dactyl or heroic and he 
arrang them in some manner which i do not quit understand make 
the rhythm equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short 
altern and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic a well 
a of a trochaic rhythm and assign to them short and long quantiti 
also in some case he appear to prai or censur the movement of the 
foot quit a much a the rhythm or perhap a combin of the two 
for i am not certain what he meant these matter howev a i wa 
say had better be refer to damon himself for the analysi of 
the subject would be difficult you know socrat express himself 
carelessli in accord with hi assum ignor of the detail of 
the subject in the first part of the sentenc he appear to be speak 
of paeonic rhythm which are in the ratio of 3 2 in the second part of 
dactyl and anapaest rhythm which are in the ratio of 1 1 in the 
last clau of iambic and trochaic rhythm which are in the ratio of 
1 2 or 2 1 

rather so i should say 

but there is no difficulti in see that grace or the absenc of grace 
is an effect of good or bad rhythm 

none at all 

and also that good and bad rhythm natur assimil to a good and bad 
style and that harmoni and discord in like manner follow style for our 
principl is that rhythm and harmoni are regul by the word and not 
the word by them 

just so he said they should follow the word 

and will not the word and the charact of the style depend on the 
temper of the soul 

ye 

and everyth el on the style 

ye 

then beauti of style and harmoni and grace and good rhythm depend on 
simplic i mean the true simplic of a rightli and nobli order 
mind and charact not that other simplic which is onli an euphem 
for folli 

veri true he repli 

and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these 
grace and harmoni their perpetu aim 

they must 

and sure the art of the painter and everi other creativ and 
construct art are full of them weav embroideri architectur 
and everi kind of manufactur also natur anim and veget in 
all of them there is grace or the absenc of grace and ugli and 
discord and inharmoni motion are nearli alli to ill word and ill 
natur a grace and harmoni are the twin sister of good and virtu 
and bear their like 

that is quit true he said 

but shall our superintend go no further and are the poet onli to 
be requir by u to express the imag of the good in their work on 
pain if they do anyth el of expul from our state or is the 
same control to be extend to other artist and are they also to be 
prohibit from exhibit the opposit form of vice and intemp 
and mean and indec in sculptur and build and the other 
creativ art and is he who cannot conform to thi rule of our to be 
prevent from practi hi art in our state lest the tast of our 
citizen be corrupt by him we would not have our guardian grow up 
amid imag of moral deform a in some noxiou pastur and there 
brow and feed upon mani a bane herb and flower day by day littl 
by littl until they silent gather a fester mass of corrupt 
in their own soul let our artist rather be those who are gift to 
discern the true natur of the beauti and grace then will our 
youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sight and sound and 
receiv the good in everyth and beauti the effluenc of fair work 
shall flow into the eye and ear like a health give breez from a 
purer region and insen draw the soul from earliest year into 
like and sympathi with the beauti of reason 

there can be no nobler train than that he repli 

and therefor i said glaucon music train is a more potent 
instrument than ani other becau rhythm and harmoni find their way 
into the inward place of the soul on which they mightili fasten 
impart grace and make the soul of him who is rightli educ 
grace or of him who is ill educ ungrac and also becau 
he who ha receiv thi true educ of the inner be will most 
shrewdli perceiv omiss or fault in art and natur and with a true 
tast while he prai and rejoic over and receiv into hi soul the 
good and becom nobl and good he will justli blame and hate the bad 
now in the day of hi youth even befor he is abl to know the reason 
whi and when reason come he will recogni and salut the friend with 
whom hi educ ha made him long familiar 

ye he said i quit agr with you in think that our youth should 
be train in music and on the ground which you mention 

just a in learn to read i said we were satisfi when we knew 
the letter of the alphabet which are veri few in all their recur 
size and combin not slight them a unimport whether they 
occupi a space larg or small but everywh eager to make them out 
and not think ourselv perfect in the art of read until we 
recogni them wherev they are found 

true 

or a we recogni the reflect of letter in the water or in a 
mirror onli when we know the letter themselv the same art and studi 
give u the knowledg of both 

exactli 

even so a i maintain neither we nor our guardian whom we have to 
educ can ever becom music until we and they know the essenti 
form of temper courag liber magnif and their 
kindr a well a the contrari form in all their combin 
and can recogni them and their imag wherev they are found not 
slight them either in small thing or great but believ them all 
to be within the sphere of one art and studi 

most assuredli 

and when a beauti soul harmon with a beauti form and the two 
are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sight to him who ha 
an eye to see it 

the fairest ind 

and the fairest is also the loveliest 

that may be assum 

and the man who ha the spirit of harmoni will be most in love with the 
loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmoni soul 

that is true he repli if the defici be in hi soul but if there 
be ani mere bodili defect in anoth he will be patient of it and 
will love all the same 

i perceiv i said that you have or have had experi of thi sort 
and i agr but let me ask you anoth question ha excess of pleasur 
ani affin to temper 

how can that be he repli pleasur depriv a man of the use of hi 
faculti quit a much a pain 

or ani affin to virtu in gener 

none whatev 

ani affin to wanton and intemp 

ye the greatest 

and is there ani greater or keener pleasur than that of sensual love 

no nor a madder 

wherea true love is a love of beauti and order temper and 
harmoni 

quit true he said 

then no intemp or mad should be allow to approach true love 

certainli not 

then mad or intemp pleasur must never be allow to come near the 
lover and hi belov neither of them can have ani part in it if their 
love is of the right sort 

no ind socrat it must never come near them 

then i suppo that in the citi which we are found you would make a 
law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiar to 
hi love than a father would use to hi son and then onli for a nobl 
purpo and he must first have the other s consent and thi rule is 
to limit him in all hi intercour and he is never to be seen go 
further or if he exc he is to be deem guilti of coar and 
bad tast 

i quit agr he said 

thu much of music which make a fair end for what should be the 
end of music if not the love of beauti 

i agr he said 

after music come gymnast in which our youth are next to be train 

certainli 

gymnast a well a music should begin in earli year the train 
in it should be care and should continu through life now my belief 
is and thi is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion 
in confirm of my own but my own belief is not that the good bodi 
by ani bodili excel improv the soul but on the contrari that 
the good soul by her own excel improv the bodi a far a thi 
may be possibl what do you say 

ye i agr 

then to the mind when adequ train we shall be right in hand 
over the more particular care of the bodi and in order to avoid 
prolix we will now onli give the gener outlin of the subject 

veri good 

that they must abstain from intox ha been alreadi remark by 
u for of all person a guardian should be the last to get drunk and 
not know where in the world he is 

ye he said that a guardian should requir anoth guardian to take 
care of him is ridicul ind 

but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in train 
for the great contest of all are they not 

ye he said 

and will the habit of bodi of our ordinari athlet be suit to them 

whi not 

i am afraid i said that a habit of bodi such a they have is but a 
sleepi sort of thing and rather peril to health do you not observ 
that these athlet sleep away their life and are liabl to most 
danger ill if they depart in ever so slight a degr from 
their customari regimen 

ye i do 

then i said a finer sort of train will be requir for our warrior 
athlet who are to be like wake dog and to see and hear with the 
utmost keen amid the mani chang of water and also of food of 
summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endur when on a 
campaign they must not be liabl to break down in health 

that is my view 

the realli excel gymnast is twin sister of that simpl music which 
we were just now describ 

how so 

whi i conceiv that there is a gymnast which like our music is 
simpl and good and especi the militari gymnast 

what do you mean 

my mean may be learn from homer he you know feed hi hero at 
their feast when they are campaign on soldier fare they have 
no fish although they are on the shore of the hellespont and they 
are not allow boil meat but onli roast which is the food most 
conveni for soldier requir onli that they should light a fire 
and not involv the troubl of carri about pot and pan 

true 

and i can hardli be mistaken in say that sweet sauc are nowher 
mention in homer in proscrib them howev he is not singular 
all profess athlet are well awar that a man who is to be in good 
condit should take noth of the kind 

ye he said and know thi they are quit right in not take them 

then you would not approv of syracusan dinner and the refin of 
sicilian cookeri 

i think not 

nor if a man is to be in condit would you allow him to have a 
corinthian girl a hi fair friend 

certainli not 

neither would you approv of the delicaci a they are thought of 
athenian confectionari 

certainli not 

all such feed and live may be rightli compar by u to melodi and 
song compo in the panharmon style and in all the rhythm 

exactli 

there complex engend licenc and here disea wherea 
simplic in music wa the parent of temper in the soul and 
simplic in gymnast of health in the bodi 

most true he said 

but when intemp and disea multipli in a state hall of justic 
and medicin are alway be open and the art of the doctor and the 
lawyer give themselv air find how keen is the interest which not 
onli the slave but the freeman of a citi take about them 

of cour 

and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgrac state 
of educ than thi that not onli artisan and the meaner sort of 
peopl need the skill of first rate physician and judg but also 
those who would profess to have had a liber educ is it not 
disgrac and a great sign of want of good breed that a man 
should have to go abroad for hi law and physic becau he ha none of 
hi own at home and must therefor surrend himself into the hand of 
other men whom he make lord and judg over him 

of all thing he said the most disgrac 

would you say most i repli when you consid that there is 
a further stage of the evil in which a man is not onli a life long 
litig pa all hi day in the court either a plaintiff or 
defend but is actual led by hi bad tast to pride himself on hi 
litigi he imago that he is a master in dishonesti abl to 
take everi crook turn and wriggl into and out of everi hole 
bend like a withi and get out of the way of justic and all 
for what in order to gain small point not worth mention he not 
know that so to order hi life a to be abl to do without a nap 
judg is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more 
disgrac 

ye he said that is still more disgrac 

well i said and to requir the help of medicin not when a wound 
ha to be cure or on occa of an epidem but just becau by 
indol and a habit of life such a we have been describ men 
fill themselv with water and wind a if their bodi were a marsh 
compel the ingeni son of asclepiu to find more name for 
disea such a flatul and catarrh is not thi too a disgrac 

ye he said they do certainli give veri strang and newfangl name 
to disea 

ye i said and i do not believ that there were ani such disea in 
the day of asclepiu and thi i infer from the circumst that the 
hero eurypylu after he ha been wound in homer drink a posset of 
pramnian wine well besprinkl with barley meal and grate chee which 
are certainli inflammatori and yet the son of asclepiu who were 
at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who give him the drink or 
rebuk patroclu who is treat hi case 

well he said that wa sure an extraordinari drink to be given to a 
person in hi condit 

not so extraordinari i repli if you bear in mind that in former 
day a is commonli said befor the time of herodicu the guild of 
asclepiu did not practi our present system of medicin which may be 
said to educ disea but herodicu be a trainer and himself of 
a sickli constitut by a combin of train and doctor found 
out a way of tortur first and chiefli himself and secondli the rest 
of the world 

how wa that he said 

by the invent of linger death for he had a mortal disea which 
he perpetu tend and a recoveri wa out of the question he 
pa hi entir life a a valetudinarian he could do noth but 
attend upon himself and he wa in constant torment whenev he depart 
in anyth from hi usual regimen and so die hard by the help of 
scienc he struggl on to old age 

a rare reward of hi skill 

ye i said a reward which a man might fairli expect who never 
understood that if asclepiu did not instruct hi descend 
in valetudinarian art the omiss aro not from ignor or 
inexperi of such a branch of medicin but becau he knew that in 
all well order state everi individu ha an occup to which he 
must attend and ha therefor no leisur to spend in continu be 
ill thi we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicr enough 
do not appli the same rule to peopl of the richer sort 

how do you mean he said 

i mean thi when a carpent is ill he ask the physician for a rough 
and readi cure an emet or a purg or a cauteri or the knife these 
are hi remedi and if some one prescrib for him a cour of 
dietet and tell him that he must swath and swaddl hi head and 
all that sort of thing he repli at onc that he ha no time to be 
ill and that he see no good in a life which is spent in nur 
hi disea to the neglect of hi customari employ and therefor 
bid good bye to thi sort of physician he resum hi ordinari 
habit and either get well and life and doe hi busi or if hi 
constitut fail he dy and ha no more troubl 

ye he said and a man in hi condit of life ought to use the art of 
medicin thu far onli 

ha he not i said an occup and what profit would there be in hi 
life if he were depriv of hi occup 

quit true he said 

but with the rich man thi is otherwi of him we do not say that he 
ha ani special appoint work which he must perform if he would 
live 

he is gener suppo to have noth to do 

then you never heard of the say of phocylid that a soon a a man 
ha a livelihood he should practi virtu 

nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 

let u not have a disput with him about thi i said but rather ask 
ourselv is the practic of virtu obligatori on the rich man or 
can he live without it and if obligatori on him then let u rai 
a further question whether thi diet of disord which is an 
impedi to the applic of the mind in carpent and the 
mechan art doe not equal stand in the way of the sentiment of 
phocylid 

of that he repli there can be no doubt such excess care of the 
bodi when carri beyond the rule of gymnast is most inim to 
the practic of virtu 

ye ind i repli and equal incompat with the manag of 
a hou an armi or an offic of state and what is most import 
of all irreconcil with ani kind of studi or thought or 
self reflect there is a constant suspicion that headach and 
giddi are to be ascrib to philosophi and henc all practi or 
make trial of virtu in the higher sen is absolut stop for 
a man is alway fanci that he is be made ill and is in constant 
anxieti about the state of hi bodi 

ye like enough 

and therefor our polit asclepiu may be suppo to have exhibit 
the power of hi art onli to person who be gener of healthi 
constitut and habit of life had a definit ailment such a these 
he cure by purg and oper and bade them live a usual herein 
consult the interest of the state but bodi which disea had 
penetr through and through he would not have attempt to cure 
by gradual process of evacu and infu he did not want to 
lengthen out good for noth life or to have weak father beget 
weaker son if a man wa not abl to live in the ordinari way he 
had no busi to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use 
either to himself or to the state 

then he said you regard asclepiu a a statesman 

clearli and hi charact is further illustr by hi son note that 
they were hero in the day of old and practi the medicin of which 
i am speak at the sieg of troy you will rememb how when pandaru 
wound menelau they 

suck the blood out of the wound and sprinkl sooth remedi 

but they never prescrib what the patient wa afterward to eat or 
drink in the case of menelau ani more than in the case of eurypylu 
the remedi a they conceiv were enough to heal ani man who befor 
he wa wound wa healthi and regular in hi habit and even though he 
did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the 
same but they would have noth to do with unhealthi and intemp 
subject whose life were of no use either to themselv or other the 
art of medicin wa not design for their good and though they were a 
rich a mida the son of asclepiu would have declin to attend them 

they were veri acut person those son of asclepiu 

natur so i repli nevertheless the tragedian and pindar 
disobey our behest although they acknowledg that asclepiu wa the 
son of apollo say also that he wa bribe into heal a rich man 
who wa at the point of death and for thi reason he wa struck by 
lightn but we in accord with the principl alreadi affirm by 
u will not believ them when they tell u both if he wa the son of 
a god we maintain that he wa not avarici or if he wa avarici 
he wa not the son of a god 

all that socrat is excel but i should like to put a question to 
you ought there not to be good physician in a state and are not the 
best those who have treat the greatest number of constitut good 
and bad and are not the best judg in like manner those who are 
acquaint with all sort of moral natur 

ye i said i too would have good judg and good physician but do 
you know whom i think good 

will you tell me 

i will if i can let me howev note that in the same question you join 
two thing which are not the same 

how so he ask 

whi i said you join physician and judg now the most skil 
physician are those who from their youth upward have combin with 
the knowledg of their art the greatest experi of disea they 
had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of 
disea in their own person for the bodi a i conceiv is not the 
instrument with which they cure the bodi in that case we could not 
allow them ever to be or to have been sickli but they cure the bodi 
with the mind and the mind which ha becom and is sick can cure 
noth 

that is veri true he said 

but with the judg it is otherwi sinc he govern mind by mind he 
ought not therefor to have been train among viciou mind and to 
have associ with them from youth upward and to have gone through 
the whole calendar of crime onli in order that he may quickli infer 
the crime of other a he might their bodili disea from hi own 
self consciou the honour mind which is to form a healthi 
judgment should have had no experi or contamin of evil habit 
when young and thi is the reason whi in youth good men often appear to 
be simpl and are easili practi upon by the dishonest becau they 
have no exampl of what evil is in their own soul 

ye he said they are far too apt to be deceiv 

therefor i said the judg should not be young he should have learn 
to know evil not from hi own soul but from late and long observ 
of the natur of evil in other knowledg should be hi guid not 
person experi 

ye he said that is the ideal of a judg 

ye i repli and he will be a good man which is my answer to your 
question for he is good who ha a good soul but the cun and 
suspici natur of which we spoke he who ha commit mani crime 
and fanci himself to be a master in wick when he is amongst 
hi fellow is wonder in the precaut which he take becau he 
judg of them by himself but when he get into the compani of men of 
virtu who have the experi of age he appear to be a fool again 
owe to hi unseason suspicion he cannot recogni an honest man 
becau he ha no pattern of honesti in himself at the same time a 
the bad are more numer than the good and he meet with them often 
he think himself and is by other thought to be rather wise than 
foolish 

most true he said 

then the good and wise judg whom we are seek is not thi man but 
the other for vice cannot know virtu too but a virtuou natur 
educ by time will acquir a knowledg both of virtu and vice the 
virtuou and not the viciou man ha wisdom in my opinion 

and in mine also 

thi is the sort of medicin and thi is the sort of law which you 
will sanction in your state they will minist to better natur 
give health both of soul and of bodi but those who are disea in 
their bodi they will leav to die and the corrupt and incur soul 
they will put an end to themselv 

that is clearli the best thing both for the patient and for the state 

and thu our youth have been educ onli in that simpl music 
which a we said inspir temper will be reluct to go to law 

clearli 

and the musician who keep to the same track is content to practi 
the simpl gymnast will have noth to do with medicin unless in 
some extrem case 

that i quit believ 

the veri exerci and toll which he undergo are intend to 
stimul the spirit element of hi natur and not to increa hi 
strength he will not like common athlet use exerci and regimen to 
develop hi muscl 

veri right he said 

neither are the two art of music and gymnast realli design a is 
often suppo the one for the train of the soul the other for the 
train of the bodi 

what then is the real object of them 

i believ i said that the teacher of both have in view chiefli the 
improv of the soul 

how can that be he ask 

did you never observ i said the effect on the mind itself of 
exclu devot to gymnast or the opposit effect of an exclu 
devot to music 

in what way shown he said 

the one produc a temper of hard and feroc the other of 
soft and effeminaci i repli 

ye he said i am quit awar that the mere athlet becom too much of 
a savag and that the mere musician is melt and soften beyond what 
is good for him 

yet sure i said thi feroc onli come from spirit which if 
rightli educ would give courag but if too much intensifi is 
liabl to becom hard and brutal 

that i quit think 

on the other hand the philosoph will have the qualiti of gentl 
and thi also when too much indulg will turn to soft but if 
educ rightli will be gentl and moder 

true 

and in our opinion the guardian ought to have both these qualiti 

assuredli 

and both should be in harmoni 

beyond question 

and the harmoni soul is both temper and courag 

ye 

and the inharmoni is cowardli and boorish 

veri true 

and when a man allow music to play upon him and to pour into hi soul 
through the funnel of hi ear those sweet and soft and melancholi air 
of which we were just now speak and hi whole life is pa in 
warbl and the delight of song in the first stage of the process 
the passion or spirit which is in him is temper like iron and made 
use instead of brittl and useless but if he carri on the 
soften and sooth process in the next stage he begin to melt and 
wast until he ha wast away hi spirit and cut out the sinew of hi 
soul and he becom a feebl warrior 

veri true 

if the element of spirit is natur weak in him the chang is speedili 
accomplish but if he have a good deal then the power of music 
weaken the spirit render him excit on the least provoc 
he flame up at onc and is speedili extinguish instead of have 
spirit he grow irrit and passion and is quit impract 

exactli 

and so in gymnast if a man take violent exerci and is a great 
feeder and the rever of a great student of music and philosophi at 
first the high condit of hi bodi fill him with pride and spirit 
and he becom twice the man that he wa 

certainli 

and what happen if he do noth el and hold no conver with the 
muse doe not even that intellig which there may be in him have 
no tast of ani sort of learn or enquiri or thought or cultur 
grow feebl and dull and blind hi mind never wake up or receiv 
nourish and hi sen not be purg of their mist 

true he said 

and he end by becom a hater of philosophi uncivil never use 
the weapon of persua he is like a wild beast all violenc and 
fierc and know no other way of deal and he life in all 
ignor and evil condit and ha no sen of proprieti and grace 

that is quit true he said 

and a there are two principl of human natur one the spirit 
and the other the philosoph some god a i should say ha given 
mankind two art answer to them and onli indirectli to the soul 
and bodi in order that these two principl like the string of 
an instrument may be relax or drawn tighter until they are duli 
harmon 

that appear to be the intent 

and he who mingl music with gymnast in the fairest proport and 
best attemp them to the soul may be rightli call the true musician 
and harmonist in a far higher sen than the tuner of the string 

you are quit right socrat 

and such a presid geniu will be alway requir in our state if the 
govern is to last 

ye he will be absolut necessari 

such then are our principl of nurtur and educ where would be 
the use of go into further detail about the danc of our citizen 
or about their hunt and cour their gymnast and equestrian 
contest for these all follow the gener principl and have found 
that we shall have no difficulti in discov them 

i dare say that there will be no difficulti 

veri good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who 
are to be ruler and who subject 

certainli 

there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 

clearli 

and that the best of these must rule 

that is also clear 

now are not the best husbandman those who are most devot to 
husbandri 

ye 

and a we are to have the best of guardian for our citi must they not 
be those who have most the charact of guardian 

ye 

and to thi end they ought to be wise and effici and to have a 
special care of the state 

true 

and a man will be most like to care about that which he love 

to be sure 

and he will be most like to love that which he regard a have the 
same interest with himself and that of which the good or evil fortun 
is suppo by him at ani time most to affect hi own 

veri true he repli 

then there must be a select let u note among the guardian those 
who in their whole life show the greatest eager to do what is for 
the good of their countri and the greatest repugn to do what is 
against her interest 

those are the right men 

and they will have to be watch at everi age in order that we may see 
whether they preserv their resolut and never under the influenc 
either of forc or enchant forget or cast off their sen of duti 
to the state 

how cast off he said 

i will explain to you i repli a resolut may go out of a man s 
mind either with hi will or against hi will with hi will when he 
get rid of a falsehood and learn better against hi will whenev he 
is depriv of a truth 

i understand he said the will loss of a resolut the mean of 
the unwil i have yet to learn 

whi i said do you not see that men are unwillingli depriv of good 
and willingli of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to 
po the truth a good and you would agr that to conceiv thing a 
they are is to po the truth 

ye he repli i agr with you in think that mankind are depriv 
of truth against their will 

and is not thi involuntari depriv cau either by theft or 
forc or enchant 

still he repli i do not understand you 

i fear that i must have been talk darkli like the tragedian i onli 
mean that some men are chang by persua and that other forget 
argument steal away the heart of one class and time of the other and 
thi i call theft now you understand me 

ye 

those again who are forc are those whom the violenc of some pain or 
grief compel to chang their opinion 

i understand he said and you are quit right 

and you would also acknowledg that the enchant are those who chang 
their mind either under the softer influenc of pleasur or the 
sterner influenc of fear 

ye he said everyth that deceiv may be said to enchant 

therefor a i wa just now say we must enquir who are the best 
guardian of their own convict that what they think the interest 
of the state is to be the rule of their life we must watch them from 
their youth upward and make them perform action in which they are 
most like to forget or to be deceiv and he who rememb and is 
not deceiv is to be select and he who fail in the trial is to be 
reject that will be the way 

ye 

and there should also be toil and pain and conflict prescrib for 
them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same 
qualiti 

veri right he repli 

and then i said we must tri them with enchant that is the third 
sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take 
colt amid noi and tumult to see if they are of a timid natur so 
must we take our youth amid terror of some kind and again pa them 
into pleasur and prove them more thoroughli than gold is prove in 
the furnac that we may discov whether they are arm against 
all enchant and of a nobl bear alway good guardian of 
themselv and of the music which they have learn and retain under 
all circumst a rhythmic and harmoni natur such a will be 
most servic to the individu and to the state and he who at everi 
age a boy and youth and in matur life ha come out of the trial 
victori and pure shall be appoint a ruler and guardian of the 
state he shall be honour in life and death and shall receiv 
sepultur and other memori of honour the greatest that we have to 
give but him who fail we must reject i am inclin to think that 
thi is the sort of way in which our ruler and guardian should be 
chosen and appoint i speak gener and not with ani preten to 
exact 

and speak gener i agr with you he said 

and perhap the word guardian in the fullest sen ought to be appli 
to thi higher class onli who preserv u against foreign enemi and 
maintain peac among our citizen at home that the one may not have the 
will or the other the power to harm u the young men whom we 
befor call guardian may be more properli design auxiliari and 
support of the principl of the ruler 

i agr with you he said 

how then may we devi one of those need falsehood of which we 
late spoke just one royal lie which may deceiv the ruler if that 
be possibl and at ani rate the rest of the citi 

what sort of lie he said 

noth new i repli onli an old phoenician tale law of what ha 
often occur befor now in other place a the poet say and have 
made the world believ though not in our time and i do not know 
whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made 
probabl if it did 

how your word seem to hesit on your lip 

you will not wonder i repli at my hesit when you have heard 

speak he said and fear not 

well then i will speak although i realli know not how to look you 
in the face or in what word to utter the audaci fiction which 
i propo to commun gradual first to the ruler then to the 
soldier and lastli to the peopl they are to be told that their youth 
wa a dream and the educ and train which they receiv from 
u an appear onli in realiti dure all that time they were be 
form and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselv and their 
arm and appurten were manufactur when they were complet the 
earth their mother sent them up and so their countri be their 
mother and also their nur they are bound to advi for her good and 
to defend her against attack and her citizen they are to regard a 
child of the earth and their own brother 

you had good reason he said to be asham of the lie which you were 
go to tell 

true i repli but there is more come i have onli told you half 
citizen we shall say to them in our tale you are brother yet god 
ha frame you differ some of you have the power of command and 
in the composit of these he ha mingl gold wherefor also 
they have the greatest honour other he ha made of silver to be 
auxiliari other again who are to be husbandman and craftsman he ha 
compo of brass and iron and the speci will gener be preserv 
in the child but a all are of the same origin stock a golden 
parent will sometim have a silver son or a silver parent a golden 
son and god proclaim a a first principl to the ruler and abov all 
el that there is noth which they should so anxiou guard or of 
which they are to be such good guardian a of the puriti of the race 
they should observ what element mingl in their offspr for if the 
son of a golden or silver parent ha an admixtur of brass and iron 
then natur order a transposit of rank and the eye of the ruler 
must not be piti toward the child becau he ha to descend in the 
scale and becom a husbandman or artisan just a there may be son of 
artisan who have an admixtur of gold or silver in them are rai 
to honour and becom guardian or auxiliari for an oracl say that 
when a man of brass or iron guard the state it will be destroy such 
is the tale is there ani possibl of make our citizen believ in 
it 

not in the present gener he repli there is no way of 
accomplish thi but their son may be made to believ in the tale 
and their son son and poster after them 

i see the difficulti i repli yet the foster of such a belief will 
make them care more for the citi and for one anoth enough howev 
of the fiction which may now fli abroad upon the wing of rumour while 
we arm our earth born hero and lead them forth under the command of 
their ruler let them look round and select a spot whenc they can best 
suppress insurrect if ani prove refractori within and also defend 
themselv against enemi who like wolf may come down on the fold 
from without there let them encamp and when they have encamp let 
them sacrif to the proper god and prepar their dwell 

just so he said 

and their dwell must be such a will shield them against the cold of 
winter and the heat of summer 

i suppo that you mean hou he repli 

ye i said but they must be the hou of soldier and not of 
shop keeper 

what is the differ he said 

that i will endeavour to explain i repli to keep watch dog who 
from want of disciplin or hunger or some evil habit or other would 
turn upon the sheep and worri them and behav not like dog but wolf 
would be a foul and monstrou thing in a shepherd 

truli monstrou he said 

and therefor everi care must be taken that our auxiliari be 
stronger than our citizen may not grow to be too much for them and 
becom savag tyrant instead of friend and alli 

ye great care should be taken 

and would not a realli good educ furnish the best safeguard 

but they are well educ alreadi he repli 

i cannot be so confid my dear glaucon i said i am much more 
certain that they ought to be and that true educ whatev that 
may be will have the greatest tendenc to civil and human them 
in their relat to one anoth and to those who are under their 
protect 

veri true he repli 

and not onli their educ but their habit and all that 
belong to them should be such a will neither impair their virtu a 
guardian nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizen ani man of 
sen must acknowledg that 

he must 

then now let u consid what will be their way of life if they are to 
realiz our idea of them in the first place none of them should have 
ani properti of hi own beyond what is absolut necessari neither 
should they have a privat hou or store close against ani one who ha 
a mind to enter their provi should be onli such a are requir 
by train warrior who are men of temper and courag they should 
agr to receiv from the citizen a fix rate of pay enough to meet 
the expen of the year and no more and they will go to mess and live 
togeth like soldier in a camp gold and silver we will tell them 
that they have from god the divin metal is within them and they have 
therefor no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not 
to pollut the divin by ani such earthli admixtur for that common 
metal ha been the sourc of mani unholi deed but their own is 
undefil and they alon of all the citizen may not touch or handl 
silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or 
drink from them and thi will be their salvat and they will be the 
saviour of the state but should they ever acquir home or land 
or money of their own they will becom housekeep and husbandman 
instead of guardian enemi and tyrant instead of alli of the other 
citizen hate and be hate plot and be plot against 
they will pa their whole life in much greater terror of intern than 
of extern enemi and the hour of ruin both to themselv and to the 
rest of the state will be at hand for all which reason may we not 
say that thu shall our state be order and that these shall be the 
regul appoint by u for guardian concern their hou and 
all other matter 

ye said glaucon 




book iv 

here adeimantu interpo a question how would you answer socrat 
said he if a person were to say that you are make these peopl 
miser and that they are the cau of their own unhappi the 
citi in fact belong to them but they are none the better for it 
wherea other men acquir land and build larg and handsom hou 
and have everyth handsom about them offer sacrif to the god 
on their own account and practi hospit moreov a you were 
say just now they have gold and silver and all that is usual among 
the favourit of fortun but our poor citizen are no better than 
mercenari who are quarter in the citi and are alway mount guard 

ye i said and you may add that they are onli fed and not paid in 
addit to their food like other men and therefor they cannot if 
they would take a journey of pleasur they have no money to spend on 
a mistress or ani other luxuri fanci which a the world go is 
thought to be happi and mani other accu of the same natur 
might be ad 

but said he let u suppo all thi to be includ in the charg 

you mean to ask i said what will be our answer 

ye 

if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall 
find the answer and our answer will be that even a they are our 
guardian may veri like be the happiest of men but that our aim in 
found the state wa not the disproport happi of ani one 
class but the greatest happi of the whole we thought that in a 
state which is order with a view to the good of the whole we should 
be most like to find justic and in the ill order state injust 
and have found them we might then decid which of the two is the 
happier at present i take it we are fashion the happi state 
not piecem or with a view of make a few happi citizen but a a 
whole and by and by we will proceed to view the opposit kind of state 
suppo that we were paint a statu and some one came up to u 
and said whi do you not put the most beauti colour on the most 
beauti part of the bodi the eye ought to be purpl but you have 
made them black to him we might fairli answer sir you would not 
sure have u beautifi the eye to such a degr that they are no 
longer eye consid rather whether by give thi and the other 
featur their due proport we make the whole beauti and so i say 
to you do not compel u to assign to the guardian a sort of happi 
which will make them anyth but guardian for we too can cloth our 
husbandman in royal apparel and set crown of gold on their head and 
bid them till the ground a much a they like and no more our potter 
also might be allow to repo on couch and feast by the firesid 
pa round the winecup while their wheel is conveni at hand 
and work at potteri onli a much a they like in thi way we might 
make everi class happi and then a you imagin the whole state would 
be happi but do not put thi idea into our head for if we listen 
to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will 
cea to be a potter and no one will have the charact of ani distinct 
class in the state now thi is not of much consequ where the 
corrupt of societi and preten to be what you are not is 
confin to cobbler but when the guardian of the law and of the 
govern are onli seem and not real guardian then see how they 
turn the state upsid down and on the other hand they alon have the 
power of give order and happi to the state we mean our guardian 
to be true saviour and not the destroy of the state wherea our 
oppon is think of peasant at a festiv who are enjoy a life 
of revelri not of citizen who are do their duti to the state but 
if so we mean differ thing and he is speak of someth which 
is not a state and therefor we must consid whether in appoint 
our guardian we would look to their greatest happi individu or 
whether thi principl of happi doe not rather resid in the state 
a a whole but if the latter be the truth then the guardian and 
auxiliari and all other equal with them must be compel or 
induc to do their own work in the best way and thu the whole state 
will grow up in a nobl order and the sever class will receiv the 
proport of happi which natur assign to them 

i think that you are quit right 

i wonder whether you will agr with anoth remark which occur to me 

what may that be 

there seem to be two cau of the deterior of the art 

what are they 

wealth i said and poverti 

how do they act 

the process is a follow when a potter becom rich will he think 
you ani longer take the same pain with hi art 

certainli not 

he will grow more and more indol and careless 

veri true 

and the result will be that he becom a wor potter 

ye he greatli deterior 

but on the other hand if he ha no money and cannot provid himself 
with tool or instrument he will not work equal well himself nor 
will he teach hi son or apprent to work equal well 

certainli not 

then under the influenc either of poverti or of wealth workman and 
their work are equal liabl to degen 

that is evid 

here then is a discoveri of new evil i said against which 
the guardian will have to watch or they will creep into the citi 
unobserv 

what evil 

wealth i said and poverti the one is the parent of luxuri and 
indol and the other of mean and viciou and both of 
discont 

that is veri true he repli but still i should like to know 
socrat how our citi will be abl to go to war especi against an 
enemi who is rich and power if depriv of the sinew of war 

there would certainli be a difficulti i repli in go to war with 
one such enemi but there is no difficulti where there are two of them 

how so he ask 

in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be 
train warrior fight against an armi of rich men 

that is true he said 

and do you not suppo adeimantu that a singl boxer who wa 
perfect in hi art would easili be a match for two stout and well to do 
gentleman who were not boxer 

hardli if they came upon him at onc 

what now i said if he were abl to run away and then turn and strike 
at the one who first came up and suppo he were to do thi sever 
time under the heat of a scorch sun might he not be an expert 
overturn more than one stout personag 

certainli he said there would be noth wonder in that 

and yet rich men probabl have a greater superior in the scienc and 
practi of box than they have in militari qualiti 

like enough 

then we may assum that our athlet will be abl to fight with two or 
three time their own number 

i agr with you for i think you right 

and suppo that befor engag our citizen send an embassi to one 
of the two citi tell them what is the truth silver and gold we 
neither have nor are permit to have but you may do you therefor 
come and help u in war and take the spoil of the other citi who 
on hear these word would choo to fight against lean wiri dog 
rather than with the dog on their side against fat and tender sheep 

that is not like and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if 
the wealth of mani state were to be gather into one 

but how simpl of you to use the term state at all of ani but our own 

whi so 

you ought to speak of other state in the plural number not one of 
them is a citi but mani citi a they say in the game for ind ani 
citi howev small is in fact divid into two one the citi of the 
poor the other of the rich these are at war with one anoth and in 
either there are mani smaller divi and you would be altogeth 
besid the mark if you treat them all a a singl state but if you 
deal with them a mani and give the wealth or power or person of the 
one to the other you will alway have a great mani friend and not 
mani enemi and your state while the wise order which ha now been 
prescrib continu to prevail in her will be the greatest of state 
i do not mean to say in reput or appear but in deed and truth 
though she number not more than a thousand defend a singl state 
which is her equal you will hardli find either among hellen or 
barbarian though mani that appear to be a great and mani time 
greater 

that is most true he said 

and what i said will be the best limit for our ruler to fix when they 
are consid the size of the state and the amount of territori which 
they are to includ and beyond which they will not go 

what limit would you propo 

i would allow the state to increa so far a is consist with uniti 
that i think is the proper limit 

veri good he said 

here then i said is anoth order which will have to be convey to 
our guardian let our citi be account neither larg nor small but 
one and self suffic 

and sure said he thi is not a veri sever order which we impo 
upon them 

and the other said i of which we were speak befor is lighter 
still i mean the duti of degrad the offspr of the guardian when 
inferior and of elev into the rank of guardian the offspr of 
the lower class when natur superior the intent wa that in 
the case of the citizen gener each individu should be put to the 
use for which natur intend him one to one work and then everi man 
would do hi own busi and be one and not mani and so the whole 
citi would be one and not mani 

ye he said that is not so difficult 

the regul which we are prescrib my good adeimantu are not 
a might be suppo a number of great principl but trifl all 
if care be taken a the say is of the one great thing a thing 
howev which i would rather call not great but suffici for our 
purpo 

what may that be he ask 

educ i said and nurtur if our citizen are well educ 
and grow into sensibl men they will easili see their way through all 
these a well a other matter which i omit such for exampl a 
marriag the poss of woman and the procreat of child which 
will all follow the gener principl that friend have all thing in 
common a the proverb say 

that will be the best way of settl them 

also i said the state if onc start well move with accumul 
forc like a wheel for good nurtur and educ implant good 
constitut and these good constitut take root in a good 
educ improv more and more and thi improv affect the breed 
in man a in other anim 

veri possibl he said 

then to sum up thi is the point to which abov all the attent of 
our ruler should be direct that music and gymnast be preserv in 
their origin form and no innov made they must do their utmost 
to maintain them intact and when ani one say that mankind most regard 

the newest song which the singer have 

they will be afraid that he may be prai not new song but a new 
kind of song and thi ought not to be prai or conceiv to be the 
mean of the poet for ani music innov is full of danger to the 
whole state and ought to be prohibit so damon tell me and i 
can quit believ him he say that when mode of music chang the 
fundament law of the state alway chang with them 

ye said adeimantu and you may add my suffrag to damon s and your 
own 

then i said our guardian must lay the foundat of their fortress 
in music 

ye he said the lawless of which you speak too easili steal in 

ye i repli in the form of amu and at first sight it appear 
harmless 

whi ye he said and there is no harm were it not that littl by 
littl thi spirit of licenc find a home impercept penetr 
into manner and custom whenc issu with greater forc it invad 
contract between man and man and from contract go on to law and 
constitut in utter reckless end at last socrat by an 
overthrow of all right privat a well a public 

is that true i said 

that is my belief he repli 

then a i wa say our youth should be train from the first in 
a stricter system for if amu becom lawless and the youth 
themselv becom lawless they can never grow up into well conduct 
and virtuou citizen 

veri true he said 

and when they have made a good begin in play and by the help of 
music have gain the habit of good order then thi habit of order in 
a manner how unlik the lawless play of the other will accompani them 
in all their action and be a principl of growth to them and if there 
be ani fallen place in the state will rai them up again 

veri true he said 

thu educ they will invent for themselv ani lesser rule which 
their predecessor have altogeth neglect 

what do you mean 

i mean such thing a these when the young are to be silent befor 
their elder how they are to show respect to them by stand and 
make them sit what honour is due to parent what garment or shoe 
are to be worn the mode of dress the hair deport and manner in 
gener you would agr with me 

ye 

but there is i think small wisdom in legisl about such 
matter i doubt if it is ever done nor are ani preci written 
enact about them like to be last 

imposs 

it would seem adeimantu that the direct in which educ start 
a man will determin hi futur life doe not like alway attract 
like 

to be sure 

until some one rare and grand result is reach which may be good and 
may be the rever of good 

that is not to be deni 

and for thi reason i said i shall not attempt to legisl further 
about them 

natur enough he repli 

well and about the busi of the agora and the ordinari deal 
between man and man or again about agreement with artisan about 
insult and injuri or the commenc of action and the appoint 
of juri what would you say there may also ari question about 
ani imposit and exact of market and harbour due which may 
be requir and in gener about the regul of market polic 
harbour and the like but oh heaven shall we condescend to 
legisl on ani of these particular 

i think he said that there is no need to impo law about them on 
good men what regul are necessari they will find out soon enough 
for themselv 

ye i said my friend if god will onli preserv to them the law which 
we have given them 

and without divin help said adeimantu they will go on for ever 
make and mend their law and their life in the hope of attain 
perfect 

you would compar them i said to those invalid who have no 
self restraint will not leav off their habit of intemp 

exactli 

ye i said and what a delight life they lead they are alway 
doctor and increa and complic their disord and alway 
fanci that they will be cure by ani nostrum which anybodi advi 
them to tri 

such case are veri common he said with invalid of thi sort 

ye i repli and the charm thing is that they deem him their worst 
enemi who tell them the truth which is simpli that unless they give 
up eat and drink and wench and idl neither drug nor cauteri 
nor spell nor amulet nor ani other remedi will avail 

charm he repli i see noth charm in go into a passion 
with a man who tell you what is right 

these gentleman i said do not seem to be in your good grace 

assuredli not 

nor would you prai the behaviour of state which act like the men whom 
i wa just now describ for are there not ill order state in 
which the citizen are forbidden under pain of death to alter the 
constitut and yet he who most sweetli court those who live under 
thi regim and indulg them and fawn upon them and is skil in 
anticip and gratifi their humour is held to be a great and 
good statesman do not these state resembl the person whom i wa 
describ 

ye he said the state are a bad a the men and i am veri far from 
prai them 

but do you not admir i said the cool and dexter of these readi 
minist of polit corrupt 

ye he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom 
the applau of the multitud ha delud into the belief that they are 
realli statesman and these are not much to be admir 

what do you mean i said you should have more feel for them when a 
man cannot measur and a great mani other who cannot measur declar 
that he is four cubit high can he help believ what they say 

nay he said certainli not in that case 

well then do not be angri with them for are they not a good a a 
play tri their hand at paltri reform such a i wa describ they 
are alway fanci that by legisl they will make an end of fraud 
in contract and the other rascal which i wa mention not 
know that they are in realiti cut off the head of a hydra 

ye he said that is just what they are do 

i conceiv i said that the true legisl will not troubl 
himself with thi class of enact whether concern law or the 
constitut either in an ill order or in a well order state for 
in the former they are quit useless and in the latter there will be no 
difficulti in devi them and mani of them will natur flow out of 
our previou regul 

what then he said is still remain to u of the work of 
legisl 

noth to u i repli but to apollo the god of delphi there 
remain the order of the greatest and noblest and chiefest thing of 
all 

which are they he said 

the institut of templ and sacrif and the entir servic of 
god demigod and hero also the order of the repositori of 
the dead and the rite which have to be observ by him who would 
propiti the inhabit of the world below these are matter of 
which we are ignor ourselv and a founder of a citi we should be 
unwi in trust them to ani interpret but our ancestr deiti he 
is the god who sit in the centr on the navel of the earth and he is 
the interpret of religion to all mankind 

you are right and we will do a you propo 

but where amid all thi is justic son of ariston tell me where now 
that our citi ha been made habit light a candl and search and 
get your brother and polemarchu and the rest of our friend to help 
and let u see where in it we can discov justic and where injust 
and in what they differ from one anoth and which of them the man who 
would be happi should have for hi portion whether seen or unseen by 
god and men 

nonsen said glaucon did you not promi to search yourself say 
that for you not to help justic in her need would be an impieti 

i do not deni that i said so and a you remind me i will be a good a 
my word but you must join 

we will he repli 

well then i hope to make the discoveri in thi way i mean to begin 
with the assumpt that our state if rightli order is perfect 

that is most certain 

and be perfect is therefor wise and valiant and temper and just 

that is likewi clear 

and whichev of these qualiti we find in the state the one which is 
not found will be the residu 

veri good 

if there were four thing and we were search for one of them 
wherev it might be the one sought for might be known to u from the 
first and there would be no further troubl or we might know the other 
three first and then the fourth would clearli be the one left 

veri true he said 

and is not a similar method to be pursu about the virtu which are 
also four in number 

clearli 

first among the virtu found in the state wisdom come into view and 
in thi i detect a certain peculiar 

what is that 

the state which we have been describ is said to be wise a be good 
in counsel 

veri true 

and good counsel is clearli a kind of knowledg for not by ignor 
but by knowledg do men counsel well 

clearli 

and the kind of knowledg in a state are mani and diver 

of cour 

there is the knowledg of the carpent but is that the sort of 
knowledg which give a citi the titl of wise and good in counsel 

certainli not that would onli give a citi the reput of skill in 
carpent 

then a citi is not to be call wise becau poss a knowledg 
which counsel for the best about wooden implement 

certainli not 

nor by reason of a knowledg which advi about brazen pot i said 
nor a poss ani other similar knowledg 

not by reason of ani of them he said 

nor yet by reason of a knowledg which cultiv the earth that would 
give the citi the name of agricultur 

ye 

well i said and is there ani knowledg in our recent found state 
among ani of the citizen which advi not about ani particular thing 
in the state but about the whole and consid how a state can best 
deal with itself and with other state 

there certainli is 

and what is thi knowledg and among whom is it found i ask 

it is the knowledg of the guardian he repli and is found among 
those whom we were just now describ a perfect guardian 

and what is the name which the citi deriv from the poss of thi 
sort of knowledg 

the name of good in counsel and truli wise 

and will there be in our citi more of these true guardian or more 
smith 

the smith he repli will be far more numer 

will not the guardian be the smallest of all the class who receiv a 
name from the profess of some kind of knowledg 

much the smallest 

and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledg 
which resid in thi presid and rule part of itself the whole 
state be thu constitut accord to natur will be wise and 
thi which ha the onli knowledg worthi to be call wisdom ha been 
ordain by natur to be of all class the least 

most true 

thu then i said the natur and place in the state of one of the four 
virtu ha somehow or other been discov 

and in my humbl opinion veri satisfactorili discov he repli 

again i said there is no difficulti in see the natur of courag 
and in what part that qualiti resid which give the name of courag 
to the state 

how do you mean 

whi i said everi one who call ani state courag or cowardli will 
be think of the part which fight and go out to war on the state s 
behalf 

no one he repli would ever think of ani other 

the rest of the citizen may be courag or may be cowardli but their 
courag or coward will not a i conceiv have the effect of make 
the citi either the one or the other 

certainli not 

the citi will be courag in virtu of a portion of herself which 
preserv under all circumst that opinion about the natur of 
thing to be fear and not to be fear in which our legisl 
educ them and thi is what you term courag 

i should like to hear what you are say onc more for i do not think 
that i perfectli understand you 

i mean that courag is a kind of salvat 

salvat of what 

of the opinion respect thing to be fear what they are and of 
what natur which the law implant through educ and i mean by the 
word under all circumst to intim that in pleasur or in pain 
or under the influenc of desir or fear a man preserv and doe not 
lose thi opinion shall i give you an illustr 

if you plea 

you know i said that dyer when they want to dye wool for make the 
true sea purpl begin by select their white colour first thi they 
prepar and dress with much care and pain in order that the white 
ground may take the purpl hue in full perfect the dye then 
proce and whatev is dy in thi manner becom a fast colour 
and no wash either with lye or without them can take away the bloom 
but when the ground ha not been duli prepar you will have notic 
how poor is the look either of purpl or of ani other colour 

ye he said i know that they have a wash out and ridicul 
appear 

then now i said you will understand what our object wa in select 
our soldier and educ them in music and gymnast we were 
contriv influenc which would prepar them to take the dye of the 
law in perfect and the colour of their opinion about danger and 
of everi other opinion wa to be indel fix by their nurtur 
and train not to be wash away by such potent lye a 
pleasur mightier agent far in wash the soul than ani soda or lye 
or by sorrow fear and desir the mightiest of all other solvent and 
thi sort of univ save power of true opinion in conform with 
law about real and fal danger i call and maintain to be courag 
unless you disagr 

but i agr he repli for i suppo that you mean to exclud mere 
uninstruct courag such a that of a wild beast or of a slave thi 
in your opinion is not the courag which the law ordain and ought to 
have anoth name 

most certainli 

then i may infer courag to be such a you describ 

whi ye said i you may and if you add the word of a citizen 
you will not be far wrong hereaft if you like we will carri the 
examin further but at present we are seek not for courag but 
justic and for the purpo of our enquiri we have said enough 

you are right he repli 

two virtu remain to be discov in the state first temper and 
then justic which is the end of our search 

veri true 

now can we find justic without troubl ourselv about temper 

i do not know how that can be accomplish he said nor do i desir 
that justic should be brought to light and temper lost sight of 
and therefor i wish that you would do me the favour of consid 
temper first 

certainli i repli i should not be justifi in refu your 
request 

then consid he said 

ye i repli i will and a far a i can at present see the virtu 
of temper ha more of the natur of harmoni and symphoni than the 
prece 

how so he ask 

temper i repli is the order or control of certain 
pleasur and desir thi is curiou enough impli in the say of 
a man be hi own master and other trace of the same notion may be 
found in languag 

no doubt he said 

there is someth ridicul in the express master of himself for 
the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all 
these mode of speak the same person is denot 

certainli 

the mean is i believ that in the human soul there is a better and 
also a wor principl and when the better ha the wor under control 
then a man is said to be master of himself and thi is a term of 
prai but when owe to evil educ or associ the better 
principl which is also the smaller is overwhelm by the greater mass 
of the wor in thi case he is blame and is call the slave of self 
and unprincipl 

ye there is reason in that 

and now i said look at our newli creat state and there you will 
find one of these two condit realiz for the state a you 
will acknowledg may be justli call master of itself if the word 
temper and self masteri truli express the rule of the better 
part over the wor 

ye he said i see that what you say is true 

let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasur and desir 
and pain are gener found in child and woman and servant and in 
the freeman so call who are of the lowest and more numer class 

certainli he said 

wherea the simpl and moder desir which follow reason and are 
under the guidanc of mind and true opinion are to be found onli in a 
few and those the best born and best educ 

veri true 

these two a you may perceiv have a place in our state and the 
meaner desir of the mani are held down by the virtuou desir and 
wisdom of the few 

that i perceiv he said 

then if there be ani citi which may be describ a master of it own 
pleasur and desir and master of itself our may claim such a 
design 

certainli he repli 

it may also be call temper and for the same reason 

ye 

and if there be ani state in which ruler and subject will be agr a 
to the question who are to rule that again will be our state 

undoubtedli 

and the citizen be thu agr among themselv in which class will 
temper be found in the ruler or in the subject 

in both a i should imagin he repli 

do you observ that we were not far wrong in our guess that temper 
wa a sort of harmoni 

whi so 

whi becau temper is unlik courag and wisdom each of which 
resid in a part onli the one make the state wise and the other 
valiant not so temper which extend to the whole and run through 
all the note of the scale and produc a harmoni of the weaker and the 
stronger and the middl class whether you suppo them to be stronger 
or weaker in wisdom or power or number or wealth or anyth el 
most truli then may we deem temper to be the agreement of the 
natur superior and inferior a to the right to rule of either both 
in state and individu 

i entir agr with you 

and so i said we may consid three out of the four virtu to have 
been discov in our state the last of those qualiti which make a 
state virtuou must be justic if we onli knew what that wa 

the infer is obviou 

the time then ha arriv glaucon when like huntsman we should 
surround the cover and look sharp that justic doe not steal away and 
pa out of sight and escap u for beyond a doubt she is somewh in 
thi countri watch therefor and strive to catch a sight of her and if 
you see her first let me know 

would that i could but you should regard me rather a a follow who 
ha just eye enough to see what you show him that is about a much a 
i am good for 

offer up a prayer with me and follow 

i will but you must show me the way 

here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplex still we 
must push on 

let u push on 

here i saw someth halloo i said i begin to perceiv a track and i 
believ that the quarri will not escap 

good news he said 

truli i said we are stupid fellow 

whi so 

whi my good sir at the begin of our enquiri age ago there wa 
justic tumbl out at our foot and we never saw her noth could be 
more ridicul like peopl who go about look for what they have 
in their hand that wa the way with u we look not at what we 
were seek but at what wa far off in the distanc and therefor i 
suppo we miss her 

what do you mean 

i mean to say that in realiti for a long time past we have been talk 
of justic and have fail to recogni her 

i grow impati at the length of your exordium 

well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you rememb the 
origin principl which we were alway lay down at the foundat 
of the state that one man should practi one thing onli the thing to 
which hi natur wa best adapt now justic is thi principl or a 
part of it 

ye we often said that one man should do one thing onli 

further we affirm that justic wa do one s own busi and not 
be a busybodi we said so again and again and mani other have said 
the same to u 

ye we said so 

then to do one s own busi in a certain way may be assum to be 
justic can you tell me whenc i deriv thi infer 

i cannot but i should like to be told 

becau i think that thi is the onli virtu which remain in the 
state when the other virtu of temper and courag and wisdom are 
abstract and that thi is the ultim cau and condit of the 
exist of all of them and while remain in them is also their 
preserv and we were say that if the three were discov by 
u justic would be the fourth or remain one 

that follow of necess 

if we are ask to determin which of these four qualiti by it 
presenc contribut most to the excel of the state whether the 
agreement of ruler and subject or the preserv in the soldier of 
the opinion which the law ordain about the true natur of danger or 
wisdom and watch in the ruler or whether thi other which i am 
mention and which is found in child and woman slave and freeman 
artisan ruler subject the qualiti i mean of everi one do hi 
own work and not be a busybodi would claim the palm the question 
is not so easili answer 

certainli he repli there would be a difficulti in say which 

then the power of each individu in the state to do hi own work 
appear to compet with the other polit virtu wisdom temper 
courag 

ye he said 

and the virtu which enter into thi competit is justic 

exactli 

let u look at the question from anoth point of view are not 
the ruler in a state those to whom you would entrust the offic of 
determin suit at law 

certainli 

and are suit decid on ani other ground but that a man may neither 
take what is anoth s nor be depriv of what is hi own 

ye that is their principl 

which is a just principl 

ye 

then on thi view also justic will be admit to be the have and 
do what is a man s own and belong to him 

veri true 

think now and say whether you agr with me or not suppo a 
carpent to be do the busi of a cobbler or a cobbler of a 
carpent and suppo them to exchang their implement or their 
duti or the same person to be do the work of both or whatev be 
the chang do you think that ani great harm would result to the state 

not much 

but when the cobbler or ani other man whom natur design to be a 
trader have hi heart lift up by wealth or strength or the number 
of hi follow or ani like advantag attempt to forc hi way 
into the class of warrior or a warrior into that of legisl and 
guardian for which he is unfit and either to take the implement 
or the duti of the other or when one man is trader legisl and 
warrior all in one then i think you will agr with me in say that 
thi interchang and thi meddl of one with anoth is the ruin of 
the state 

most true 

see then i said that there are three distinct class ani meddl 
of one with anoth or the chang of one into anoth is the greatest 
harm to the state and may be most justli term evil do 

preci 

and the greatest degr of evil do to one s own citi would be term 
by you injust 

certainli 

thi then is injust and on the other hand when the trader the 
auxiliari and the guardian each do their own busi that is justic 
and will make the citi just 

i agr with you 

we will not i said be over posit a yet but if on trial thi 
concept of justic be verifi in the individu a well a in 
the state there will be no longer ani room for doubt if it be not 
verifi we must have a fresh enquiri first let u complet the old 
investig which we began a you rememb under the impress 
that if we could previou examin justic on the larger scale there 
would be le difficulti in discern her in the individu that 
larger exampl appear to be the state and accordingli we construct 
a good a one a we could know well that in the good state justic 
would be found let the discoveri which we made be now appli to the 
individu if they agr we shall be satisfi or if there be a 
differ in the individu we will come back to the state and 
have anoth trial of the theori the friction of the two when rub 
togeth may possibl strike a light in which justic will shine forth 
and the vision which is then reveal we will fix in our soul 

that will be in regular cour let u do a you say 

i proceed to ask when two thing a greater and le are call by 
the same name are they like or unlik in so far a they are call the 
same 

like he repli 

the just man then if we regard the idea of justic onli will be like 
the just state 

he will 

and a state wa thought by u to be just when the three class in the 
state sever did their own busi and also thought to be temper 
and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affect and qualiti 
of these same class 

true he said 

and so of the individu we may assum that he ha the same three 
principl in hi own soul which are found in the state and he may be 
rightli describ in the same term becau he is affect in the same 
manner 

certainli he said 

onc more then o my friend we have alight upon an easi 
question whether the soul ha these three principl or not 

an easi question nay rather socrat the proverb hold that hard is 
the good 

veri true i said and i do not think that the method which we are 
employ is at all adequ to the accur solut of thi question 
the true method is anoth and a longer one still we may arriv at a 
solut not below the level of the previou enquiri 

may we not be satisfi with that he said under the circumst i 
am quit content 

i too i repli shall be extrem well satisfi 

then faint not in pursu the specul he said 

must we not acknowledg i said that in each of u there are the same 
principl and habit which there are in the state and that from the 
individu they pa into the state how el can they come there take 
the qualiti of passion or spirit it would be ridicul to imagin 
that thi qualiti when found in state is not deriv from the 
individu who are suppo to po it e g the thracian 
scythian and in gener the northern nation and the same may be said 
of the love of knowledg which is the special characterist of our 
part of the world or of the love of money which may with equal truth 
be attribut to the phoenician and egyptian 

exactli so he said 

there is no difficulti in understand thi 

none whatev 

but the question is not quit so easi when we proceed to ask whether 
these principl are three or one whether that is to say we learn 
with one part of our natur are angri with anoth and with a third 
part desir the satisfact of our natur appetit or whether the 
whole soul come into play in each sort of action to determin that is 
the difficulti 

ye he said there lie the difficulti 

then let u now tri and determin whether they are the same or 
differ 

how can we he ask 

i repli a follow the same thing clearli cannot act or be act upon 
in the same part or in relat to the same thing at the same time 
in contrari way and therefor whenev thi contradict occur in 
thing appar the same we know that they are realli not the same 
but differ 

good 

for exampl i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the 
same time in the same part 

imposs 

still i said let u have a more preci statement of term lest we 
should hereaft fall out by the way imagin the case of a man who is 
stand and also move hi hand and hi head and suppo a person 
to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same 
moment to such a mode of speech we should object and should rather say 
that one part of him is in motion while anoth is at rest 

veri true 

and suppo the objector to refin still further and to draw the nice 
distinct that not onli part of top but whole top when they spin 
round with their peg fix on the spot are at rest and in motion at 
the same time and he may say the same of anyth which revolv in the 
same spot hi object would not be admit by u becau in 
such case thing are not at rest and in motion in the same part of 
themselv we should rather say that they have both an axi and a 
circumf and that the axi stand still for there is no deviat 
from the perpendicular and that the circumf go round but if 
while revolv the axi inclin either to the right or left forward 
or backward then in no point of view can they be at rest 

that is the correct mode of describ them he repli 

then none of these object will confu u or inclin u to believ 
that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relat to 
the same thing can act or be act upon in contrari way 

certainli not accord to my way of think 

yet i said that we may not be compel to examin all such 
object and prove at length that they are untru let u assum 
their absurd and go forward on the understand that hereaft if 
thi assumpt turn out to be untru all the consequ which follow 
shall be withdrawn 

ye he said that will be the best way 

well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desir and 
aver attract and repul are all of them opposit whether 
they are regard a activ or passiv for that make no differ in 
the fact of their opposit 

ye he said they are opposit 

well i said and hunger and thirst and the desir in gener and 
again will and wish all these you would refer to the class 
alreadi mention you would say would you not that the soul of him 
who desir is seek after the object of hi desir or that he is 
draw to himself the thing which he wish to po or again 
when a person want anyth to be given him hi mind long for the 
realiz of hi desir intim hi wish to have it by a nod of 
assent a if he had been ask a question 

veri true 

and what would you say of unwil and dislik and the absenc of 
desir should not these be refer to the opposit class of repul 
and reject 

certainli 

admit thi to be true of desir gener let u suppo a 
particular class of desir and out of these we will select hunger and 
thirst a they are term which are the most obviou of them 

let u take that class he said 

the object of one is food and of the other drink 

ye 

and here come the point is not thirst the desir which the soul ha of 
drink and of drink onli not of drink qualifi by anyth el for 
exampl warm or cold or much or littl or in a word drink of ani 
particular sort but if the thirst be accompani by heat then the 
desir is of cold drink or if accompani by cold then of warm drink 
or if the thirst be excess then the drink which is desir will be 
excess or if not great the quantiti of drink will also be small 
but thirst pure and simpl will desir drink pure and simpl which is 
the natur satisfact of thirst a food is of hunger 

ye he said the simpl desir is a you say in everi case of the 
simpl object and the qualifi desir of the qualifi object 

but here a confu may ari and i should wish to guard against an 
oppon start up and say that no man desir drink onli but good 
drink or food onli but good food for good is the univ object of 
desir and thirst be a desir will necessarili be thirst after good 
drink and the same is true of everi other desir 

ye he repli the oppon might have someth to say 

nevertheless i should still maintain that of rel some have a 
qualiti attach to either term of the relat other are simpl and 
have their correl simpl 

i do not know what you mean 

well you know of cour that the greater is rel to the le 

certainli 

and the much greater to the much le 

ye 

and the sometim greater to the sometim le and the greater that is 
to be to the le that is to be 

certainli he said 

and so of more and le and of other correl term such a the 
doubl and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter 
and the slower and of hot and cold and of ani other rel is not 
thi true of all of them 

ye 

and doe not the same principl hold in the scienc the object of 
scienc is knowledg assum that to be the true definit but 
the object of a particular scienc is a particular kind of knowledg 
i mean for exampl that the scienc of hou build is a kind of 
knowledg which is defin and distinguish from other kind and is 
therefor term architectur 

certainli 

becau it ha a particular qualiti which no other ha 

ye 

and it ha thi particular qualiti becau it ha an object of a 
particular kind and thi is true of the other art and scienc 

ye 

now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my origin 
mean in what i said about rel my mean wa that if one term 
of a relat is taken alon the other is taken alon if one term 
is qualifi the other is also qualifi i do not mean to say that 
rel may not be dispar or that the scienc of health is 
healthi or of disea necessarili disea or that the scienc of 
good and evil are therefor good and evil but onli that when the term 
scienc is no longer use absolut but ha a qualifi object which 
in thi case is the natur of health and disea it becom defin 
and is henc call not mere scienc but the scienc of medicin 

i quit understand and i think a you do 

would you not say that thirst is one of these essenti rel 
term have clearli a relat 

ye thirst is rel to drink 

and a certain kind of thirst is rel to a certain kind of drink but 
thirst taken alon is neither of much nor littl nor of good nor bad 
nor of ani particular kind of drink but of drink onli 

certainli 

then the soul of the thirsti one in so far a he is thirsti desir 
onli drink for thi he yearn and tri to obtain it 

that is plain 

and if you suppo someth which pull a thirsti soul away from drink 
that must be differ from the thirsti principl which draw him like 
a beast to drink for a we were say the same thing cannot at the 
same time with the same part of itself act in contrari way about the 
same 

imposs 

no more than you can say that the hand of the archer push and pull the 
bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand push and the 
other pull 

exactli so he repli 

and might a man be thirsti and yet unwil to drink 

ye he said it constantli happen 

and in such a case what is one to say would you not say that there 
wa someth in the soul bid a man to drink and someth el 
forbid him which is other and stronger than the principl which 
bid him 

i should say so 

and the forbid principl is deriv from reason and that which bid 
and attract proce from passion and disea 

clearli 

then we may fairli assum that they are two and that they differ from 
one anoth the one with which a man reason we may call the ration 
principl of the soul the other with which he love and hunger and 
thirst and feel the flutter of ani other desir may be term 
the irrat or appetit the alli of sundri pleasur and 
satisfact 

ye he said we may fairli assum them to be differ 

then let u final determin that there are two principl exist in 
the soul and what of passion or spirit is it a third or akin to one 
of the prece 

i should be inclin to say akin to desir 

well i said there is a stori which i rememb to have heard and in 
which i put faith the stori is that leontiu the son of aglaion 
come up one day from the piraeu under the north wall on the outsid 
observ some dead bodi lie on the ground at the place of execut 
he felt a desir to see them and also a dread and abhorr of them 
for a time he struggl and cover hi eye but at length the desir 
got the better of him and forc them open he ran up to the dead 
bodi say look ye wretch take your fill of the fair sight 

i have heard the stori myself he said 

the moral of the tale is that anger at time go to war with desir 
a though they were two distinct thing 

ye that is the mean he said 

and are there not mani other case in which we observ that when a man s 
desir violent prevail over hi reason he revil himself and is 
angri at the violenc within him and that in thi struggl which is 
like the struggl of faction in a state hi spirit is on the side of 
hi reason but for the passion or spirit element to take part 
with the desir when reason decid that she should not be oppo 
is a sort of thing which i believ that you never observ occur in 
yourself nor a i should imagin in ani one el 

certainli not 

suppo that a man think he ha done a wrong to anoth the nobler 
he is the le abl is he to feel indign at ani suffer such a 
hunger or cold or ani other pain which the injur person may inflict 
upon him these he deem to be just and a i say hi anger refu to 
be excit by them 

true he said 

but when he think that he is the suffer of the wrong then he boil 
and chafe and is on the side of what he belief to be justic and 
becau he suffer hunger or cold or other pain he is onli the more 
determin to persev and conquer hi nobl spirit will not be 
quell until he either slay or is slain or until he hear the voic 
of the shepherd that is reason bid hi dog bark no more 

the illustr is perfect he repli and in our state a we were 
say the auxiliari were to be dog and to hear the voic of the 
ruler who are their shepherd 

i perceiv i said that you quit understand me there is howev a 
further point which i wish you to consid 

what point 

you rememb that passion or spirit appear at first sight to be a kind 
of desir but now we should say quit the contrari for in the conflict 
of the soul spirit is array on the side of the ration principl 

most assuredli 

but a further question ari is passion differ from reason also or 
onli a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principl 
in the soul there will onli be two the ration and the concupisc 
or rather a the state wa compo of three class trader 
auxiliari counsellor so may there not be in the individu soul a 
third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupt by bad 
educ is the natur auxiliari of reason 

ye he said there must be a third 

ye i repli if passion which ha alreadi been shown to be differ 
from desir turn out also to be differ from reason 

but that is easili prove we may observ even in young child that 
they are full of spirit almost a soon a they are born wherea some 
of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late 
enough 

excel i said and you may see passion equal in brute anim 
which is a further proof of the truth of what you are say and we may 
onc more appeal to the word of homer which have been alreadi quot 
by u 

he smote hi breast and thu rebuk hi soul 

for in thi ver homer ha clearli suppo the power which reason 
about the better and wor to be differ from the unreason anger 
which is rebuk by it 

veri true he said 

and so after much toss we have reach land and are fairli agr 
that the same principl which exist in the state exist also in the 
individu and that they are three in number 

exactli 

must we not then infer that the individu is wise in the same way and 
in virtu of the same qualiti which make the state wise 

certainli 

also that the same qualiti which constitut courag in the state 
constitut courag in the individu and that both the state and the 
individu bear the same relat to all the other virtu 

assuredli 

and the individu will be acknowledg by u to be just in the same way 
in which the state is just 

that follow of cour 

we cannot but rememb that the justic of the state consist in each 
of the three class do the work of it own class 

we are not veri like to have forgotten he said 

we must recollect that the individu in whom the sever qualiti of 
hi natur do their own work will be just and will do hi own work 

ye he said we must rememb that too 

and ought not the ration principl which is wise and ha the care of 
the whole soul to rule and the passion or spirit principl to be 
the subject and alli 

certainli 

and a we were say the unit influenc of music and gymnast will 
bring them into accord nerv and sustain the reason with nobl 
word and lesson and moder and sooth and civil the 
wild of passion by harmoni and rhythm 

quit true he said 

and these two thu nurtur and educ and have learn truli to 
know their own function will rule over the concupisc which in each 
of u is the largest part of the soul and by natur most insati of 
gain over thi they will keep guard lest wax great and strong with 
the ful of bodili pleasur a they are term the concupisc 
soul no longer confin to her own sphere should attempt to enslav 
and rule those who are not her natur born subject and overturn the 
whole life of man 

veri true he said 

both togeth will they not be the best defend of the whole soul and 
the whole bodi against attack from without the one counsel and 
the other fight under hi leader and courag execut hi 
command and counsel 

true 

and he is to be deem courag whose spirit retain in pleasur and 
in pain the command of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear 

right he repli 

and him we call wise who ha in him that littl part which rule and 
which proclaim these command that part too be suppo to have a 
knowledg of what is for the interest of each of the three part and of 
the whole 

assuredli 

and would you not say that he is temper who ha these same element 
in friendli harmoni in whom the one rule principl of reason and 
the two subject one of spirit and desir are equal agr that reason 
ought to rule and do not rebel 

certainli he said that is the true account of temper whether in 
the state or individu 

and sure i said we have explain again and again how and by virtu 
of what qualiti a man will be just 

that is veri certain 

and is justic dimmer in the individu and is her form differ or 
is she the same which we found her to be in the state 

there is no differ in my opinion he said 

becau if ani doubt is still linger in our mind a few commonplac 
instanc will satisfi u of the truth of what i am say 

what sort of instanc do you mean 

if the case is put to u must we not admit that the just state or 
the man who is train in the principl of such a state will be le 
like than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver 
would ani one deni thi 

no one he repli 

will the just man or citizen ever be guilti of sacrileg or theft or 
treacheri either to hi friend or to hi countri 

never 

neither will he ever break faith where there have been oath or 
agreement 

imposs 

no one will be le like to commit adulteri or to dishonour hi 
father and mother or to fail in hi religi duti 

no one 

and the reason is that each part of him is do it own busi 
whether in rule or be rule 

exactli so 

are you satisfi then that the qualiti which make such men and such 
state is justic or do you hope to discov some other 

not i ind 

then our dream ha been realiz and the suspicion which we entertain 
at the begin of our work of construct that some divin power 
must have conduct u to a primari form of justic ha now been 
verifi 

ye certainli 

and the divi of labour which requir the carpent and the 
shoemak and the rest of the citizen to be do each hi own 
busi and not anoth s wa a shadow of justic and for that 
reason it wa of use 

clearli 

but in realiti justic wa such a we were describ be concern 
howev not with the outward man but with the inward which is the 
true self and concern of man for the just man doe not permit the 
sever element within him to interf with one anoth or ani of 
them to do the work of other he set in order hi own inner life and 
is hi own master and hi own law and at peac with himself and when 
he ha bound togeth the three principl within him which may be 
compar to the higher lower and middl note of the scale and the 
intermedi interv when he ha bound all these togeth and is 
no longer mani but ha becom one entir temper and perfectli 
adjust natur then he proce to act if he ha to act whether in 
a matter of properti or in the treatment of the bodi or in some affair 
of polit or privat busi alway think and call that which 
preserv and co oper with thi harmoni condit just and good 
action and the knowledg which presid over it wisdom and that which 
at ani time impair thi condit he will call unjust action and the 
opinion which presid over it ignor 

you have said the exact truth socrat 

veri good and if we were to affirm that we had discov the just man 
and the just state and the natur of justic in each of them we should 
not be tell a falsehood 

most certainli not 

may we say so then 

let u say so 

and now i said injust ha to be consid 

clearli 

must not injust be a strife which ari among the three 
principl a meddlesom and interf and rise up of a part 
of the soul against the whole an assert of unlaw author which 
is made by a rebelli subject against a true princ of whom he is the 
natur vassal what is all thi confu and delu but injust 
and intemp and coward and ignor and everi form of vice 

exactli so 

and if the natur of justic and injust be known then the mean of 
act unjustli and be unjust or again of act justli will also 
be perfectli clear 

what do you mean he said 

whi i said they are like disea and health be in the soul just 
what disea and health are in the bodi 

how so he said 

whi i said that which is healthi cau health and that which is 
unhealthi cau disea 

ye 

and just action cau justic and unjust action cau injust 

that is certain 

and the creation of health is the institut of a natur order and 
govern of one by anoth in the part of the bodi and the creation 
of disea is the product of a state of thing at varianc with thi 
natur order 

true 

and is not the creation of justic the institut of a natur order 
and govern of one by anoth in the part of the soul and the 
creation of injust the product of a state of thing at varianc 
with the natur order 

exactli so he said 

then virtu is the health and beauti and well be of the soul and 
vice the disea and weak and deform of the same 

true 

and do not good practic lead to virtu and evil practic to vice 

assuredli 

still our old question of the compar advantag of justic and 
injust ha not been answer which is the more profit to be 
just and act justli and practi virtu whether seen or unseen of 
god and men or to be unjust and act unjustli if onli unpunish and 
unreform 

in my judgment socrat the question ha now becom ridicul we 
know that when the bodili constitut is gone life is no longer 
endur though pamper with all kind of meat and drink and 
have all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the 
veri essenc of the vital principl is undermin and corrupt life 
is still worth have to a man if onli he be allow to do whatev he 
like with the singl except that he is not to acquir justic and 
virtu or to escap from injust and vice assum them both to be 
such a we have describ 

ye i said the question is a you say ridicul still a we are 
near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with 
our own eye let u not faint by the way 

certainli not he repli 

come up hither i said and behold the variou form of vice those of 
them i mean which are worth look at 

i am follow you he repli proceed 

i said the argument seem to have reach a height from which a from 
some tower of specul a man may look down and see that virtu 
is one but that the form of vice are innum there be four 
special one which are deserv of note 

what do you mean he said 

i mean i repli that there appear to be a mani form of the soul a 
there are distinct form of the state 

how mani 

there are five of the state and five of the soul i said 

what are they 

the first i said is that which we have been describ and which may 
be said to have two name monarchi and aristocraci accordingli a rule 
is exerci by one distinguish man or by mani 

true he repli 

but i regard the two name a describ one form onli for whether the 
govern is in the hand of one or mani if the governor have been 
train in the manner which we have suppo the fundament law of 
the state will be maintain 

that is true he repli 




book v 

such is the good and true citi or state and the good and true man is 
of the same pattern and if thi is right everi other is wrong and the 
evil is one which affect not onli the order of the state but also 
the regul of the individu soul and is exhibit in four form 

what are they he said 

i wa proceed to tell the order in which the four evil form appear 
to me to succeed one anoth when polemarchu who wa sit a littl 
way off just beyond adeimantu began to whisper to him stretch 
forth hi hand he took hold of the upper part of hi coat by the 
shoulder and drew him toward him lean forward himself so a to be 
quit close and say someth in hi ear of which i onli caught the 
word shall we let him off or what shall we do 

certainli not said adeimantu rai hi voic 

who is it i said whom you are refu to let off 

you he said 

i repeat whi am i especi not to be let off 

whi he said we think that you are lazi and mean to cheat u out of a 
whole chapter which is a veri import part of the stori and you fanci 
that we shall not notic your airi way of proceed a if it were 
self evid to everybodi that in the matter of woman and child 
friend have all thing in common 

and wa i not right adeimantu 

ye he said but what is right in thi particular case like everyth 
el requir to be explain for commun may be of mani kind 
plea therefor to say what sort of commun you mean we have been 
long expect that you would tell u someth about the famili life 
of your citizen how they will bring child into the world and rear 
them when they have arriv and in gener what is the natur of thi 
commun of woman and child for we are of opinion that the right 
or wrong manag of such matter will have a great and paramount 
influenc on the state for good or for evil and now sinc the question 
is still undetermin and you are take in hand anoth state we have 
resolv a you heard not to let you go until you give an account of 
all thi 

to that resolut said glaucon you may regard me a say agr 

and without more ado said thrasymachu you may consid u all to be 
equal agr 

i said you know not what you are do in thu assail me what an 
argument are you rai about the state just a i thought that i had 
finish and wa onli too glad that i had laid thi question to sleep 
and wa reflect how fortun i wa in your accept of what i then 
said you ask me to begin again at the veri foundat ignor of what 
a hornet s nest of word you are stir now i foresaw thi gather 
troubl and avoid it 

for what purpo do you conceiv that we have come here said 
thrasymachu to look for gold or to hear discour 

ye but discour should have a limit 

ye socrat said glaucon and the whole of life is the onli limit 
which wise men assign to the hear of such discour but never mind 
about u take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way 
what sort of commun of woman and child is thi which is to prevail 
among our guardian and how shall we manag the period between birth 
and educ which seem to requir the greatest care tell u how 
these thing will be 

ye my simpl friend but the answer is the rever of easi mani more 
doubt ari about thi than about our previou conclu for the 
practic of what is said may be doubt and look at in anoth 
point of view whether the scheme if ever so practic would be for 
the best is also doubt henc i feel a reluct to approach the 
subject lest our aspir my dear friend should turn out to be a 
dream onli 

fear not he repli for your audienc will not be hard upon you they 
are not sceptic or hostil 

i said my good friend i suppo that you mean to encourag me by these 
word 

ye he said 

then let me tell you that you are do just the rever the 
encourag which you offer would have been all veri well had i myself 
believ that i knew what i wa talk about to declar the truth 
about matter of high interest which a man honour and love among wise 
men who love him need occa no fear or falter in hi mind but to 
carri on an argument when you are yourself onli a hesit enquir 
which is my condit is a danger and slipperi thing and the danger 
is not that i shall be laugh at of which the fear would be childish 
but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my 
foot and drag my friend after me in my fall and i pray nemesi not 
to visit upon me the word which i am go to utter for i do ind 
believ that to be an involuntari homicid is a le crime than to be a 
deceiv about beauti or good or justic in the matter of law 
and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemi than among 
friend and therefor you do well to encourag me 

glaucon laugh and said well then socrat in case you and your 
argument do u ani seriou injuri you shall be acquit beforehand of 
the homicid and shall not be held to be a deceiv take courag then 
and speak 

well i said the law say that when a man is acquit he is free from 
guilt and what hold at law may hold in argument 

then whi should you mind 

well i repli i suppo that i must retrac my step and say what i 
perhap ought to have said befor in the proper place the part of the 
men ha been play out and now properli enough come the turn of the 
woman of them i will proceed to speak and the more readili sinc i am 
invit by you 

for men born and educ like our citizen the onli way in my 
opinion of arriv at a right conclu about the poss and 
use of woman and child is to follow the path on which we origin 
start when we said that the men were to be the guardian and 
watchdog of the herd 

true 

let u further suppo the birth and educ of our woman to be 
subject to similar or nearli similar regul then we shall see 
whether the result accord with our design 

what do you mean 

what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dog 
divid into he and she or do they both share equal in hunt and 
in keep watch and in the other duti of dog or do we entrust to 
the male the entir and exclu care of the flock while we leav 
the femal at home under the idea that the bear and suckl their 
puppi is labour enough for them 

no he said they share alik the onli differ between them is that 
the male are stronger and the femal weaker 

but can you use differ anim for the same purpo unless they are 
bred and fed in the same way 

you cannot 

then if woman are to have the same duti a men they must have the 
same nurtur and educ 

ye 

the educ which wa assign to the men wa music and gymnast 

ye 

then woman must be taught music and gymnast and also the art of war 
which they must practi like the men 

that is the infer i suppo 

i should rather expect i said that sever of our propo if they 
are carri out be unusu may appear ridicul 

no doubt of it 

ye and the most ridicul thing of all will be the sight of woman 
nake in the palaestra exerci with the men especi when they 
are no longer young they certainli will not be a vision of beauti ani 
more than the enthusiast old men who in spite of wrinkl and ugli 
continu to frequent the gymnasium 

ye ind he said accord to present notion the propo would be 
thought ridicul 

but then i said a we have determin to speak our mind we must not 
fear the jest of the wit which will be direct against thi sort of 
innov how they will talk of woman s attain both in music 
and gymnast and abov all about their wear armour and ride upon 
horseback 

veri true he repli 

yet have begun we must go forward to the rough place of the law at 
the same time beg of these gentleman for onc in their life to be 
seriou not long ago a we shall remind them the hellen were of the 
opinion which is still gener receiv among the barbarian that 
the sight of a nake man wa ridicul and improp and when first the 
cretan and then the lacedaemonian introduc the custom the wit of 
that day might equal have ridicul the innov 

no doubt 

but when experi show that to let all thing be uncov wa far 
better than to cover them up and the ludicr effect to the outward 
eye vanish befor the better principl which reason assert then the 
man wa perceiv to be a fool who direct the shaft of hi ridicul 
at ani other sight but that of folli and vice or seriou inclin to 
weigh the beauti by ani other standard but that of the good 

veri true he repli 

first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest 
let u come to an understand about the natur of woman is she 
capabl of share either wholli or partial in the action of men or 
not at all and is the art of war one of those art in which she can or 
can not share that will be the best way of commenc the enquiri and 
will probabl lead to the fairest conclu 

that will be much the best way 

shall we take the other side first and begin by argu against 
ourselv in thi manner the adversari s posit will not be 
undefend 

whi not he said 

then let u put a speech into the mouth of our oppon they will 
say socrat and glaucon no adversari need convict you for you 
yourselv at the first foundat of the state admit the principl 
that everybodi wa to do the one work suit to hi own natur and 
certainli if i am not mistaken such an admiss wa made by u and 
do not the natur of men and woman differ veri much ind and we 
shall repli of cour they do then we shall be ask whether the 
task assign to men and to woman should not be differ and such a 
are agreeabl to their differ natur certainli they should but 
if so have you not fallen into a seriou inconsist in say that 
men and woman whose natur are so entir differ ought to perform 
the same action what defenc will you make for u my good sir 
against ani one who offer these object 

that is not an easi question to answer when ask suddenli and i shall 
and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side 

these are the object glaucon and there are mani other of a like 
kind which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluct to 
take in hand ani law about the poss and nurtur of woman and 
child 

by zeu he said the problem to be solv is anyth but easi 

whi ye i said but the fact is that when a man is out of hi depth 
whether he ha fallen into a littl swim bath or into mid ocean he 
ha to swim all the same 

veri true 

and must not we swim and tri to reach the shore we will hope that 
arion s dolphin or some other miracul help may save u 

i suppo so he said 

well then let u see if ani way of escap can be found we 
acknowledg did we not that differ natur ought to have differ 
pursuit and that men s and woman s natur are differ and now 
what are we say that differ natur ought to have the same 
pursuit thi is the inconsist which is charg upon u 

preci 

verili glaucon i said gloriou is the power of the art of 
contradict 

whi do you say so 

becau i think that mani a man fall into the practic against hi 
will when he think that he is reason he is realli disput just 
becau he cannot defin and divid and so know that of which he is 
speak and he will pursu a mere verbal opposit in the spirit of 
content and not of fair discu 

ye he repli such is veri often the case but what ha that to do 
with u and our argument 

a great deal for there is certainli a danger of our get 
unint into a verbal opposit 

in what way 

whi we valiantli and pugnaci insist upon the verbal truth that 
differ natur ought to have differ pursuit but we never 
consid at all what wa the mean of same or differ of 
natur or whi we distinguish them when we assign differ pursuit 
to differ natur and the same to the same natur 

whi no he said that wa never consid by u 

i said suppo that by way of illustr we were to ask the question 
whether there is not an opposit in natur between bald men and hairi 
men and if thi is admit by u then if bald men are cobbler we 
should forbid the hairi men to be cobbler and conver 

that would be a jest he said 

ye i said a jest and whi becau we never meant when we construct 
the state that the opposit of natur should extend to everi 
differ but onli to those differ which affect the pursuit 
in which the individu is engag we should have argu for exampl 
that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have 
the same natur 

true 

wherea the physician and the carpent have differ natur 

certainli 

and if i said the male and femal sex appear to differ in their 
fit for ani art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art 
ought to be assign to one or the other of them but if the differ 
consist onli in woman bear and men beget child thi doe not 
amount to a proof that a woman differ from a man in respect of the 
sort of educ she should receiv and we shall therefor continu 
to maintain that our guardian and their wife ought to have the same 
pursuit 

veri true he said 

next we shall ask our oppon how in refer to ani of the pursuit 
or art of civic life the natur of a woman differ from that of a man 

that will be quit fair 

and perhap he like yourself will repli that to give a suffici 
answer on the instant is not easi but after a littl reflect there 
is no difficulti 

ye perhap 

suppo then that we invit him to accompani u in the argument and 
then we may hope to show him that there is noth peculiar in the 
constitut of woman which would affect them in the administr of 
the state 

by all mean 

let u say to him come now and we will ask you a question when you 
spoke of a natur gift or not gift in ani respect did you mean to 
say that one man will acquir a thing easili anoth with difficulti a 
littl learn will lead the one to discov a great deal wherea 
the other after much studi and applic no sooner learn than he 
forget or again did you mean that the one ha a bodi which is a 
good servant to hi mind while the bodi of the other is a hindranc to 
him would not these be the sort of differ which distinguish the 
man gift by natur from the one who is ungift 

no one will deni that 

and can you mention ani pursuit of mankind in which the male sex ha not 
all these gift and qualiti in a higher degr than the femal need 
i wast time in speak of the art of weav and the manag of 
pancak and preserv in which womankind doe realli appear to be 
great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all thing the 
most absurd 

you are quit right he repli in maintain the gener inferior 
of the femal sex although mani woman are in mani thing superior to 
mani men yet on the whole what you say is true 

and if so my friend i said there is no special faculti of 
administr in a state which a woman ha becau she is a woman or 
which a man ha by virtu of hi sex but the gift of natur are alik 
diffu in both all the pursuit of men are the pursuit of woman 
also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man 

veri true 

then are we to impo all our enact on men and none of them on 
woman 

that will never do 

one woman ha a gift of heal anoth not one is a musician and 
anoth ha no music in her natur 

veri true 

and one woman ha a turn for gymnast and militari exerci and 
anoth is unwarlik and hate gymnast 

certainli 

and one woman is a philosoph and anoth is an enemi of philosophi 
one ha spirit and anoth is without spirit 

that is also true 

then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and anoth not wa 
not the select of the male guardian determin by differ of 
thi sort 

ye 

men and woman alik po the qualiti which make a guardian they 
differ onli in their compar strength or weak 

obviou 

and those woman who have such qualiti are to be select a the 
companion and colleagu of men who have similar qualiti and whom 
they resembl in capac and in charact 

veri true 

and ought not the same natur to have the same pursuit 

they ought 

then a we were say befor there is noth unnatur in assign 
music and gymnast to the wife of the guardian to that point we come 
round again 

certainli not 

the law which we then enact wa agreeabl to natur and therefor not 
an imposs or mere aspir and the contrari practic which 
prevail at present is in realiti a violat of natur 

that appear to be true 

we had to consid first whether our propo were possibl and 
secondli whether they were the most benefici 

ye 

and the possibl ha been acknowledg 

ye 

the veri great benefit ha next to be establish 

quit so 

you will admit that the same educ which make a man a good guardian 
will make a woman a good guardian for their origin natur is the 
same 

ye 

i should like to ask you a question 

what is it 

would you say that all men are equal in excel or is one man better 
than anoth 

the latter 

and in the commonwealth which we were found do you conceiv the 
guardian who have been brought up on our model system to be more 
perfect men or the cobbler whose educ ha been cobbl 

what a ridicul question 

you have answer me i repli well and may we not further say that 
our guardian are the best of our citizen 

by far the best 

and will not their wife be the best woman 

ye by far the best 

and can there be anyth better for the interest of the state than 
that the men and woman of a state should be a good a possibl 

there can be noth better 

and thi is what the art of music and gymnast when present in such 
manner a we have describ will accomplish 

certainli 

then we have made an enact not onli possibl but in the highest 
degr benefici to the state 

true 

then let the wife of our guardian strip for their virtu will be 
their robe and let them share in the toil of war and the defenc of 
their countri onli in the distribut of labour the lighter are to be 
assign to the woman who are the weaker natur but in other respect 
their duti are to be the same and a for the man who laugh at nake 
woman exerci their bodi from the best of motif in hi laughter 
he is pluck 

a fruit of unrip wisdom 

and he himself is ignor of what he is laugh at or what he is 
about for that is and ever will be the best of say that the 
use is the nobl and the hurt is the base 

veri true 

here then is one difficulti in our law about woman which we may say 
that we have now escap the wave ha not swallow u up aliv for 
enact that the guardian of either sex should have all their 
pursuit in common to the util and also to the possibl of thi 
arrang the consist of the argument with itself bear wit 

ye that wa a mighti wave which you have escap 

ye i said but a greater is come you will not think much of thi 
when you see the next 

go on let me see 

the law i said which is the sequel of thi and of all that ha 
prece is to the follow effect that the wife of our guardian 
are to be common and their child are to be common and no parent is 
to know hi own child nor ani child hi parent 

ye he said that is a much greater wave than the other and 
the possibl a well a the util of such a law are far more 
question 

i do not think i said that there can be ani disput about the veri 
great util of have wife and child in common the possibl is 
quit anoth matter and will be veri much disput 

i think that a good mani doubt may be rai about both 

you impli that the two question must be combin i repli now i 
meant that you should admit the util and in thi way a i thought 
i should escap from one of them and then there would remain onli the 
possibl 

but that littl attempt is detect and therefor you will plea to 
give a defenc of both 

well i said i submit to my fate yet grant me a littl favour let 
me feast my mind with the dream a day dreamer are in the habit of 
feast themselv when they are walk alon for befor they have 
discov ani mean of effect their wish that is a matter which 
never troubl them they would rather not tire themselv by think 
about possibl but assum that what they desir is alreadi 
grant to them they proceed with their plan and delight in detail 
what they mean to do when their wish ha come true that is a way which 
they have of not do much good to a capac which wa never good for 
much now i myself am begin to lose heart and i should like with 
your permiss to pa over the question of possibl at present 
assum therefor the possibl of the propo i shall now proceed 
to enquir how the ruler will carri out these arrang and i shall 
demonstr that our plan if execut will be of the greatest benefit 
to the state and to the guardian first of all then if you have no 
object i will endeavour with your help to consid the advantag of 
the measur and hereaft the question of possibl 

i have no object proceed 

first i think that if our ruler and their auxiliari are to be worthi 
of the name which they bear there must be will to obey in the 
one and the power of command in the other the guardian must themselv 
obey the law and they must also imit the spirit of them in ani 
detail which are entrust to their care 

that is right he said 

you i said who are their legisl have select the men will now 
select the woman and give them to them they must be a far a possibl 
of like natur with them and they must live in common hou and meet 
at common meal none of them will have anyth special hi or her 
own they will be togeth and will be brought up togeth and 
will associ at gymnast exerci and so they will be drawn by 
a necess of their natur to have intercour with each 
other necess is not too strong a word i think 

ye he said necess not geometr but anoth sort of necess 
which lover know and which is far more convinc and constrain to 
the mass of mankind 

true i said and thi glaucon like all the rest must proceed after 
an orderli fashion in a citi of the bless licenti is an 
unholi thing which the ruler will forbid 

ye he said and it ought not to be permit 

then clearli the next thing will be to make matrimoni sacr in the 
highest degr and what is most benefici will be deem sacr 

exactli 

and how can marriag be made most benefici that is a question which 
i put to you becau i see in your hou dog for hunt and of the 
nobler sort of bird not a few now i beseech you do tell me have you 
ever attend to their pair and breed 

in what particular 

whi in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not 
some better than other 

true 

and do you breed from them all indiff or do you take care to 
breed from the best onli 

from the best 

and do you take the oldest or the youngest or onli those of ripe age 

i choo onli those of ripe age 

and if care wa not taken in the breed your dog and bird would 
greatli deterior 

certainli 

and the same of hor and anim in gener 

undoubtedli 

good heaven my dear friend i said what consumm skill will our 
ruler need if the same principl hold of the human speci 

certainli the same principl hold but whi doe thi involv ani 
particular skill 

becau i said our ruler will often have to practi upon the bodi 
corpor with medicin now you know that when patient do not requir 
medicin but have onli to be put under a regimen the inferior sort 
of practit is deem to be good enough but when medicin ha to be 
given then the doctor should be more of a man 

that is quit true he said but to what are you allud 

i mean i repli that our ruler will find a consid dose of 
falsehood and deceit necessari for the good of their subject we were 
say that the use of all these thing regard a medicin might be 
of advantag 

and we were veri right 

and thi law use of them seem like to be often need in the 
regul of marriag and birth 

how so 

whi i said the principl ha been alreadi laid down that the best of 
either sex should be unit with the best a often and the inferior 
with the inferior a seldom a possibl and that they should rear the 
offspr of the one sort of union but not of the other if the flock 
is to be maintain in first rate condit now these go on must be 
a secret which the ruler onli know or there will be a further 
danger of our herd a the guardian may be term break out into 
rebellion 

veri true 

had we not better appoint certain festiv at which we will bring 
togeth the bride and bridegroom and sacrif will be offer and 
suitabl hymen song compo by our poet the number of wed is 
a matter which must be left to the discret of the ruler whose aim 
will be to preserv the averag of popul there are mani other 
thing which they will have to consid such a the effect of war and 
disea and ani similar agenc in order a far a thi is possibl 
to prevent the state from becom either too larg or too small 

certainli he repli 

we shall have to invent some ingeni kind of lot which the le 
worthi may draw on each occa of our bring them togeth and then 
they will accu their own ill luck and not the ruler 

to be sure he said 

and i think that our braver and better youth besid their other 
honour and reward might have greater facil of intercour with 
woman given them their braveri will be a reason and such father ought 
to have a mani son a possibl 

true 

and the proper offic whether male or femal or both for offic are 
to be held by woman a well a by men 

ye 

the proper offic will take the offspr of the good parent to the 
pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nur who 
dwell in a separ quarter but the offspr of the inferior or of 
the better when they chanc to be deform will be put away in some 
mysteri unknown place a they should be 

ye he said that must be done if the breed of the guardian is to be 
kept pure 

they will provid for their nurtur and will bring the mother to the 
fold when they are full of milk take the greatest possibl care that 
no mother recogni her own child and other wet nur may be engag 
if more are requir care will also be taken that the process of 
suckl shall not be protract too long and the mother will have no 
get up at night or other troubl but will hand over all thi sort 
of thing to the nur and attend 

you suppo the wife of our guardian to have a fine easi time of it 
when they are have child 

whi said i and so they ought let u howev proceed with our 
scheme we were say that the parent should be in the prime of life 

veri true 

and what is the prime of life may it not be defin a a period of 
about twenti year in a woman s life and thirti in a man s 

which year do you mean to includ 

a woman i said at twenti year of age may begin to bear child to 
the state and continu to bear them until forti a man may begin at 
five and twenti when he ha pa the point at which the pul of life 
beat quickest and continu to beget child until he be fifti five 

certainli he said both in men and woman those year are the prime of 
physic a well a of intellectu vigour 

ani one abov or below the prescrib age who take part in the public 
hymen shall be said to have done an unholi and unright thing 
the child of which he is the father if it steal into life will have 
been conceiv under auspex veri unlik the sacrif and prayer 
which at each hymen priestess and priest and the whole citi will 
offer that the new gener may be better and more use than their 
good and use parent wherea hi child will be the offspr of 
dark and strang lust 

veri true he repli 

and the same law will appli to ani one of those within the prescrib 
age who form a connect with ani woman in the prime of life without 
the sanction of the ruler for we shall say that he is rai up a 
bastard to the state uncertifi and unconsecr 

veri true he repli 

thi appli howev onli to those who are within the specifi age 
after that we allow them to rang at will except that a man may not 
marri hi daughter or hi daughter s daughter or hi mother or hi 
mother s mother and woman on the other hand are prohibit from 
marri their son or father or son s son or father s father and 
so on in either direct and we grant all thi accompani the 
permiss with strict order to prevent ani embryo which may come into 
be from see the light and if ani forc a way to the birth the 
parent must understand that the offspr of such an union cannot be 
maintain and arrang accordingli 

that also he said is a reason proposit but how will they know 
who are father and daughter and so on 

they will never know the way will be thi date from the day of the 
hymen the bridegroom who wa then marri will call all the male 
child who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterward hi 
son and the femal child hi daughter and they will call him 
father and he will call their child hi grandchild and they will 
call the elder gener grandfath and grandmoth all who were 
begotten at the time when their father and mother came togeth will 
be call their brother and sister and these a i wa say will 
be forbidden to inter marri thi howev is not to be understood a 
an absolut prohibit of the marriag of brother and sister if the 
lot favour them and they receiv the sanction of the pythian oracl 
the law will allow them 

quit right he repli 

such is the scheme glaucon accord to which the guardian of our 
state are to have their wife and famili in common and now you would 
have the argument show that thi commun is consist with the rest 
of our politi and also that noth can be better would you not 

ye certainli 

shall we tri to find a common basi by ask of ourselv what ought 
to be the chief aim of the legisl in make law and in the 
organ of a state what is the greatest good and what is the 
greatest evil and then consid whether our previou descript ha 
the stamp of the good or of the evil 

by all mean 

can there be ani greater evil than discord and distract and plural 
where uniti ought to reign or ani greater good than the bond of uniti 

there cannot 

and there is uniti where there is commun of pleasur and 
pain where all the citizen are glad or griev on the same occa 
of joy and sorrow 

no doubt 

ye and where there is no common but onli privat feel a state is 
disorgan when you have one half of the world triumph and the 
other plung in grief at the same event happen to the citi or the 
citizen 

certainli 

such differ commonli origin in a disagr about the use of 
the term mine and not mine hi and not hi 

exactli so 

and is not that the best order state in which the greatest number of 
person appli the term mine and not mine in the same way to the 
same thing 

quit true 

or that again which most nearli approach to the condit of the 
individu a in the bodi when but a finger of one of u is hurt the 
whole frame drawn toward the soul a a centr and form one kingdom 
under the rule power therein feel the hurt and sympath all 
togeth with the part affect and we say that the man ha a pain in 
hi finger and the same express is use about ani other part of the 
bodi which ha a sensat of pain at suffer or of pleasur at the 
allevi of suffer 

veri true he repli and i agr with you that in the best order 
state there is the nearest approach to thi common feel which you 
describ 

then when ani one of the citizen experi ani good or evil the 
whole state will make hi case their own and will either rejoic or 
sorrow with him 

ye he said that is what will happen in a well order state 

it will now be time i said for u to return to our state and see 
whether thi or some other form is most in accord with these 
fundament principl 

veri good 

our state like everi other ha ruler and subject 

true 

all of whom will call one anoth citizen 

of cour 

but is there not anoth name which peopl give to their ruler in other 
state 

gener they call them master but in democrat state they simpli 
call them ruler 

and in our state what other name besid that of citizen do the peopl 
give the ruler 

they are call saviour and helper he repli 

and what do the ruler call the peopl 

their maintain and foster father 

and what do they call them in other state 

slave 

and what do the ruler call one anoth in other state 

fellow ruler 

and what in our 

fellow guardian 

did you ever know an exampl in ani other state of a ruler who would 
speak of one of hi colleagu a hi friend and of anoth a not be 
hi friend 

ye veri often 

and the friend he regard and describ a one in whom he ha an 
interest and the other a a stranger in whom he ha no interest 

exactli 

but would ani of your guardian think or speak of ani other guardian a 
a stranger 

certainli he would not for everi one whom they meet will be regard 
by them either a a brother or sister or father or mother or son or 
daughter or a the child or parent of those who are thu connect with 
him 

capit i said but let me ask you onc more shall they be a famili in 
name onli or shall they in all their action be true to the name for 
exampl in the use of the word father would the care of a father be 
impli and the filial rever and duti and obedi to him which the 
law command and is the violat of these duti to be regard a an 
impiou and unright person who is not like to receiv much good 
either at the hand of god or of man are these to be or not to be the 
strain which the child will hear repeat in their ear by all the 
citizen about those who are intim to them to be their parent and 
the rest of their kinsfolk 

these he said and none other for what can be more ridicul than for 
them to utter the name of famili tie with the lip onli and not to act 
in the spirit of them 

then in our citi the languag of harmoni and concord will be more often 
heard than in ani other a i wa describ befor when ani one is 
well or ill the univ word will be with me it is well or it is 
ill 

most true 

and agreeabl to thi mode of think and speak were we not say 
that they will have their pleasur and pain in common 

ye and so they will 

and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will 
alik call my own and have thi common interest they will have a 
common feel of pleasur and pain 

ye far more so than in other state 

and the reason of thi over and abov the gener constitut of the 
state will be that the guardian will have a commun of woman and 
child 

that will be the chief reason 

and thi uniti of feel we admit to be the greatest good a wa 
impli in our own comparison of a well order state to the relat of 
the bodi and the member when affect by pleasur or pain 

that we acknowledg and veri rightli 

then the commun of wife and child among our citizen is clearli 
the sourc of the greatest good to the state 

certainli 

and thi agr with the other principl which we were affirm that 
the guardian were not to have hou or land or ani other properti 
their pay wa to be their food which they were to receiv from the 
other citizen and they were to have no privat expen for we 
intend them to preserv their true charact of guardian 

right he repli 

both the commun of properti and the commun of famili a i am 
say tend to make them more truli guardian they will not tear 
the citi in piec by differ about mine and not mine each man 
drag ani acquisit which he ha made into a separ hou of hi 
own where he ha a separ wife and child and privat pleasur and 
pain but all will be affect a far a may be by the same pleasur 
and pain becau they are all of one opinion about what is near and 
dear to them and therefor they all tend toward a common end 

certainli he repli 

and a they have noth but their person which they can call their 
own suit and complaint will have no exist among them they will 
be deliv from all those quarrel of which money or child or 
relat are the occa 

of cour they will 

neither will trial for assault or insult ever be like to occur among 
them for that equal should defend themselv against equal we shall 
maintain to be honour and right we shall make the protect of the 
person a matter of necess 

that is good he said 

ye and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man ha a 
quarrel with anoth he will satisfi hi resent then and there and 
not proceed to more danger length 

certainli 

to the elder shall be assign the duti of rule and chasti the 
younger 

clearli 

nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do ani 
other violenc to an elder unless the magistr command him nor will 
he slight him in ani way for there are two guardian shame and fear 
mighti to prevent him shame which make men refrain from lay hand 
on those who are to them in the relat of parent fear that the 
injur one will be succour by the other who are hi brother son 
father 

that is true he repli 

then in everi way the law will help the citizen to keep the peac with 
one anoth 

ye there will be no want of peac 

and a the guardian will never quarrel among themselv there will be 
no danger of the rest of the citi be divid either against them or 
against one anoth 

none whatev 

i hardli like even to mention the littl mean of which they will 
be rid for they are beneath notic such for exampl a the 
flatteri of the rich by the poor and all the pain and pang which 
men experi in bring up a famili and in find money to buy 
necessari for their household borrow and then repudi get 
how they can and give the money into the hand of woman and slave 
to keep the mani evil of so mani kind which peopl suffer in thi way 
are mean enough and obviou enough and not worth speak of 

ye he said a man ha no need of eye in order to perceiv that 

and from all these evil they will be deliv and their life will be 
bless a the life of olymp victor and yet more bless 

how so 

the olymp victor i said is deem happi in receiv a part onli of 
the bless which is secur to our citizen who have won a more 
gloriou victori and have a more complet mainten at the public 
cost for the victori which they have won is the salvat of the whole 
state and the crown with which they and their child are crown is 
the ful of all that life need they receiv reward from the 
hand of their countri while live and after death have an honour 
burial 

ye he said and gloriou reward they are 

do you rememb i said how in the cour of the previou discu 
some one who shall be nameless accu u of make our guardian 
unhappi they had noth and might have poss all thing to whom 
we repli that if an occa offer we might perhap hereaft 
consid thi question but that a at present advi we would make 
our guardian truli guardian and that we were fashion the state 
with a view to the greatest happi not of ani particular class but 
of the whole 

ye i rememb 

and what do you say now that the life of our protector is made out to 
be far better and nobler than that of olymp victor is the life of 
shoemak or ani other artisan or of husbandman to be compar with 
it 

certainli not 

at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewh that 
if ani of our guardian shall tri to be happi in such a manner that 
he will cea to be a guardian and is not content with thi safe and 
harmoni life which in our judgment is of all life the best but 
infatu by some youth conceit of happi which get up into hi 
head shall seek to appropri the whole state to himself then he will 
have to learn how wise hesiod spoke when he said half is more than 
the whole 

if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when 
you have the offer of such a life 

you agr then i said that men and woman are to have a common way of 
life such a we have describ common educ common child and 
they are to watch over the citizen in common whether abid in the 
citi or go out to war they are to keep watch togeth and to hunt 
togeth like dog and alway and in all thing a far a they are 
abl woman are to share with the men and in so do they will do what 
is best and will not violat but preserv the natur relat of the 
sex 

i agr with you he repli 

the enquiri i said ha yet to be made whether such a commun 
be found possibl a among other anim so also among men and if 
possibl in what way possibl 

you have anticip the question which i wa about to suggest 

there is no difficulti i said in see how war will be carri on by 
them 

how 

whi of cour they will go on expedit togeth and will take with 
them ani of their child who are strong enough that after the manner 
of the artisan s child they may look on at the work which they will 
have to do when they are grown up and besid look on they will 
have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their father and 
mother did you never observ in the art how the potter boy look on 
and help long befor they touch the wheel 

ye i have 

and shall potter be more care in educ their child and in 
give them the opportun of see and practi their duti than 
our guardian will be 

the idea is ridicul he said 

there is also the effect on the parent with whom a with other 
anim the presenc of their young one will be the greatest incent 
to valour 

that is quit true socrat and yet if they are defeat which may 
often happen in war how great the danger is the child will be lost 
a well a their parent and the state will never recov 

true i said but would you never allow them to run ani risk 

i am far from say that 

well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some 
occa when if they escap disast they will be the better for it 

clearli 

whether the futur soldier do or do not see war in the day of their 
youth is a veri import matter for the sake of which some risk may 
fairli be incur 

ye veri import 

thi then must be our first step to make our child spectat 
of war but we must also contriv that they shall be secur against 
danger then all will be well 

true 

their parent may be suppo not to be blind to the risk of war but 
to know a far a human foresight can what expedit are safe and 
what danger 

that may be assum 

and they will take them on the safe expedit and be cautiou about 
the danger one 

true 

and they will place them under the command of experienc veteran who 
will be their leader and teacher 

veri properli 

still the danger of war cannot be alway foreseen there is a good 
deal of chanc about them 

true 

then against such chanc the child must be at onc furnish with 
wing in order that in the hour of need they may fli away and escap 

what do you mean he said 

i mean that we must mount them on hor in their earliest youth and 
when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the 
hor must not be spirit and warlik but the most tractabl and yet 
the swiftest that can be had in thi way they will get an excel 
view of what is hereaft to be their own busi and if there is 
danger they have onli to follow their elder leader and escap 

i believ that you are right he said 

next a to war what are to be the relat of your soldier to one 
anoth and to their enemi i should be inclin to propo that the 
soldier who leaf hi rank or throw away hi arm or is guilti of ani 
other act of coward should be degrad into the rank of a husbandman 
or artisan what do you think 

by all mean i should say 

and he who allow himself to be taken prison may a well be made a 
present of to hi enemi he is their law prey and let them do what 
they like with him 

certainli 

but the hero who ha distinguish himself what shall be done to 
him in the first place he shall receiv honour in the armi from hi 
youth comrad everi one of them in success shall crown him what 
do you say 

i approv 

and what do you say to hi receiv the right hand of fellowship 

to that too i agr 

but you will hardli agr to my next propo 

what is your propo 

that he should kiss and be kiss by them 

most certainli and i should be dispo to go further and say let 
no one whom he ha a mind to kiss refu to be kiss by him while the 
expedit last so that if there be a lover in the armi whether 
hi love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of 
valour 

capit i said that the brave man is to have more wife than other 
ha been alreadi determin and he is to have first choic in such 
matter more than other in order that he may have a mani child a 
possibl 

agr 

again there is anoth manner in which accord to homer brave 
youth should be honour for he tell how ajax after he had 
distinguish himself in battl wa reward with long chine which 
seem to be a compliment appropri to a hero in the flower of hi age 
be not onli a tribut of honour but also a veri strengthen thing 

most true he said 

then in thi i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at 
sacrif and on the like occa will honour the brave accord to 
the measur of their valour whether men or woman with hymn and those 
other distinct which we were mention also with 

seat of prece and meat and full cup 

and in honour them we shall be at the same time train them 

that he repli is excel 

ye i said and when a man dy gloriou in war shall we not say in 
the first place that he is of the golden race 

to be sure 

nay have we not the author of hesiod for affirm that when they 
are dead 

they are holi angel upon the earth author of good avert of evil 
the guardian of speech gift men 

ye and we accept hi author 

we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepultur of divin and 
heroic personag and what is to be their special distinct and we 
must do a he bid 

by all mean 

and in age to come we will rever them and kneel befor their 
sepulchr a at the graf of hero and not onli they but ani who are 
deem pre emin good whether they die from age or in ani other 
way shall be admit to the same honour 

that is veri right he said 

next how shall our soldier treat their enemi what about thi 

in what respect do you mean 

first of all in regard to slaveri do you think it right that hellen 
should enslav hellen state or allow other to enslav them if 
they can help should not their custom be to spare them consid 
the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the 
yoke of the barbarian 

to spare them is infinit better 

then no hellen should be own by them a a slave that is a rule which 
they will observ and advi the other hellen to observ 

certainli he said they will in thi way be unit against the 
barbarian and will keep their hand off one anoth 

next a to the slain ought the conqueror i said to take anyth 
but their armour doe not the practic of despoil an enemi afford 
an excu for not face the battl coward skulk about the dead 
pretend that they are fulfil a duti and mani an armi befor now 
ha been lost from thi love of plunder 

veri true 

and is there not illib and avar in rob a corp and also 
a degr of mean and womanish in make an enemi of the dead 
bodi when the real enemi ha flown away and left onli hi fight 
gear behind him is not thi rather like a dog who cannot get at hi 
assail quarrel with the stone which strike him instead 

veri like a dog he said 

then we must abstain from spoil the dead or hinder their burial 

ye he repli we most certainli must 

neither shall we offer up arm at the templ of the god least of all 
the arm of hellen if we care to maintain good feel with other 
hellen and ind we have reason to fear that the offer of 
spoil taken from kinsman may be a pollut unless command by the god 
himself 

veri true 

again a to the devast of hellen territori or the burn of 
hou what is to be the practic 

may i have the pleasur he said of hear your opinion 

both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual 
produc and no more shall i tell you whi 

pray do 

whi you see there is a differ in the name discord and war 
and i imagin that there is also a differ in their natur the one 
is express of what is intern and domest the other of what is 
extern and foreign and the first of the two is term discord and 
onli the second war 

that is a veri proper distinct he repli 

and may i not observ with equal proprieti that the hellen race is all 
unit togeth by tie of blood and friendship and alien and strang 
to the barbarian 

veri good he said 

and therefor when hellen fight with barbarian and barbarian with 
hellen they will be describ by u a be at war when they fight 
and by natur enemi and thi kind of antagon should be call war 
but when hellen fight with one anoth we shall say that hella is 
then in a state of disord and discord they be by natur friend 
and such enmiti is to be call discord 

i agr 

consid then i said when that which we have acknowledg to be 
discord occur and a citi is divid if both parti destroy the land 
and burn the hou of one anoth how wick doe the strife appear 
no true lover of hi countri would bring himself to tear in piec hi 
own nur and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriv 
the conquer of their harvest but still they would have the idea of 
peac in their heart and would not mean to go on fight for ever 

ye he said that is a better temper than the other 

and will not the citi which you are found be an hellen citi 

it ought to be he repli 

then will not the citizen be good and civil 

ye veri civil 

and will they not be lover of hella and think of hella a their own 
land and share in the common templ 

most certainli 

and ani differ which ari among them will be regard by them a 
discord onli a quarrel among friend which is not to be call a war 

certainli not 

then they will quarrel a those who intend some day to be reconcil 

certainli 

they will use friendli correct but will not enslav or destroy their 
oppon they will be corrector not enemi 

just so 

and a they are hellen themselv they will not devast hella nor 
will they burn hou nor ever suppo that the whole popul of a 
citi men woman and child are equal their enemi for they know 
that the guilt of war is alway confin to a few person and that the 
mani are their friend and for all these reason they will be unwil 
to wast their land and rase their hou their enmiti to them will 
onli last until the mani innoc suffer have compel the guilti 
few to give satisfact 

i agr he said that our citizen should thu deal with their hellen 
enemi and with barbarian a the hellen now deal with one anoth 

then let u enact thi law also for our guardian that they are 
neither to devast the land of hellen nor to burn their hou 

agr and we may agr also in think that these like all our 
previou enact are veri good 

but still i must say socrat that if you are allow to go on in 
thi way you will entir forget the other question which at the 
commenc of thi discu you thrust asid is such an order of 
thing possibl and how if at all for i am quit readi to acknowledg 
that the plan which you propo if onli feasibl would do all sort of 
good to the state i will add what you have omit that your citizen 
will be the bravest of warrior and will never leav their rank for 
they will all know one anoth and each will call the other father 
brother son and if you suppo the woman to join their armi whether 
in the same rank or in the rear either a a terror to the enemi or a 
auxiliari in case of need i know that they will then be absolut 
invinc and there are mani domest advantag which might also be 
mention and which i also fulli acknowledg but a i admit all these 
advantag and a mani more a you plea if onli thi state of your 
were to come into exist we need say no more about them assum 
then the exist of the state let u now turn to the question of 
possibl and way and mean the rest may be left 

if i loiter for a moment you instantli make a raid upon me i said and 
have no merci i have hardli escap the first and second wave and you 
seem not to be awar that you are now bring upon me the third which 
is the greatest and heaviest when you have seen and heard the third 
wave i think you will be more consid and will acknowledg 
that some fear and hesit wa natur respect a propo so 
extraordinari a that which i have now to state and investig 

the more appeal of thi sort which you make he said the more 
determin are we that you shall tell u how such a state is possibl 
speak out and at onc 

let me begin by remind you that we found our way hither in the search 
after justic and injust 

true he repli but what of that 

i wa onli go to ask whether if we have discov them we are to 
requir that the just man should in noth fail of absolut justic or 
may we be satisfi with an approxim and the attain in him of 
a higher degr of justic than is to be found in other men 

the approxim will be enough 

we were enquir into the natur of absolut justic and into the 
charact of the perfectli just and into injust and the perfectli 
unjust that we might have an ideal we were to look at these in order 
that we might judg of our own happi and unhappi accord to 
the standard which they exhibit and the degr in which we resembl 
them but not with ani view of show that they could exist in fact 

true he said 

would a painter be ani the wor becau after have delin with 
consumm art an ideal of a perfectli beauti man he wa unabl to 
show that ani such man could ever have exist 

he would be none the wor 

well and were we not creat an ideal of a perfect state 

to be sure 

and is our theori a wor theori becau we are unabl to prove the 
possibl of a citi be order in the manner describ 

sure not he repli 

that is the truth i said but if at your request i am to tri and show 
how and under what condit the possibl is highest i must ask 
you have thi in view to repeat your former admiss 

what admiss 

i want to know whether ideal are ever fulli realiz in languag 
doe not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual 
whatev a man may think alway in the natur of thing fall short of 
the truth what do you say 

i agr 

then you must not insist on my prove that the actual state will in 
everi respect coincid with the ideal if we are onli abl to discov 
how a citi may be govern nearli a we propo you will admit that we 
have discov the possibl which you demand and will be content 
i am sure that i should be content will not you 

ye i will 

let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in state which is the 
cau of their present maladministr and what is the least chang 
which will enabl a state to pa into the truer form and let the 
chang if possibl be of one thing onli or if not of two at ani 
rate let the chang be a few and slight a possibl 

certainli he repli 

i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if onli one 
chang were made which is not a slight or easi though still a possibl 
one 

what is it he said 

now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of 
the wave yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and 
drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my word 

proceed 

i said until philosoph are king or the king and princ of thi 
world have the spirit and power of philosophi and polit great 
and wisdom meet in one and those common natur who pursu either 
to the exclu of the other are compel to stand asid citi 
will never have rest from their evil nor the human race a i 
believ and then onli will thi our state have a possibl of life 
and behold the light of day such wa the thought my dear glaucon 
which i would fain have utter if it had not seem too extravag 
for to be convinc that in no other state can there be happi 
privat or public is ind a hard thing 

socrat what do you mean i would have you consid that the word 
which you have utter is one at which numer person and veri 
respect person too in a figur pull off their coat all in a 
moment and seiz ani weapon that come to hand will run at you might 
and main befor you know where you are intend to do heaven know 
what and if you don t prepar an answer and put yourself in motion 
you will be pare by their fine wit and no mistak 

you got me into the scrape i said 

and i wa quit right howev i will do all i can to get you out of 
it but i can onli give you good will and good advic and perhap i 
may be abl to fit answer to your question better than anoth that 
is all and now have such an auxiliari you must do your best to show 
the unbeliev that you are right 

i ought to tri i said sinc you offer me such invalu assist 
and i think that if there is to be a chanc of our escap we must 
explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosoph are to rule 
in the state then we shall be abl to defend ourselv there will be 
discov to be some natur who ought to studi philosophi and to be 
leader in the state and other who are not born to be philosoph 
and are meant to be follow rather than leader 

then now for a definit he said 

follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be abl to 
give you a satisfactori explan 

proceed 

i dare say that you rememb and therefor i need not remind you that 
a lover if he is worthi of the name ought to show hi love not to 
some one part of that which he love but to the whole 

i realli do not understand and therefor beg of you to assist my 
memori 

anoth person i said might fairli repli a you do but a man of 
pleasur like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of 
youth do somehow or other rai a pang or emot in a lover s breast 
and are thought by him to be worthi of hi affect regard is not 
thi a way which you have with the fair one ha a snub nose and you 
prai hi charm face the hook nose of anoth ha you say a 
royal look while he who is neither snub nor hook ha the grace of 
regular the dark visag is manli the fair are child of the god 
and a to the sweet honey pale a they are call what is the veri 
name but the invent of a lover who talk in diminut and is not 
aver to pale if appear on the cheek of youth in a word there 
is no excu which you will not make and noth which you will not 
say in order not to lose a singl flower that bloom in the spring time 
of youth 

if you make me an author in matter of love for the sake of the 
argument i assent 

and what do you say of lover of wine do you not see them do the 
same they are glad of ani pretext of drink ani wine 

veri good 

and the same is true of ambiti men if they cannot command an armi 
they are will to command a file and if they cannot be honour by 
realli great and import person they are glad to be honour by 
lesser and meaner peopl but honour of some kind they must have 

exactli 

onc more let me ask doe he who desir ani class of good desir the 
whole class or a part onli 

the whole 

and may we not say of the philosoph that he is a lover not of a part 
of wisdom onli but of the whole 

ye of the whole 

and he who dislik learn especi in youth when he ha no power 
of judg what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not 
to be a philosoph or a lover of knowledg just a he who refu hi 
food is not hungri and may be said to have a bad appetit and not a 
good one 

veri true he said 

wherea he who ha a tast for everi sort of knowledg and who is 
curiou to learn and is never satisfi may be justli term a 
philosoph am i not right 

glaucon said if curio make a philosoph you will find mani a 
strang be will have a titl to the name all the lover of sight 
have a delight in learn and must therefor be includ music 
amateur too are a folk strang out of place among philosoph for 
they are the last person in the world who would come to anyth like 
a philosoph discu if they could help while they run about at 
the dionysiac festiv a if they had let out their ear to hear everi 
choru whether the perform is in town or countri that make no 
differ they are there now are we to maintain that all these and 
ani who have similar tast a well a the professor of quit minor 
art are philosoph 

certainli not i repli they are onli an imit 

he said who then are the true philosoph 

those i said who are lover of the vision of truth 

that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean 

to anoth i repli i might have a difficulti in explain but i am 
sure that you will admit a proposit which i am about to make 

what is the proposit 

that sinc beauti is the opposit of ugli they are two 

certainli 

and inasmuch a they are two each of them is one 

true again 

and of just and unjust good and evil and of everi other class the 
same remark hold taken singli each of them is one but from the 
variou combin of them with action and thing and with one 
anoth they are seen in all sort of light and appear mani 

veri true 

and thi is the distinct which i draw between the sight love 
art love practic class and those of whom i am speak and who are 
alon worthi of the name of philosoph 

how do you distinguish them he said 

the lover of sound and sight i repli are a i conceiv fond of 
fine tone and colour and form and all the artifici product that 
are made out of them but their mind is incap of see or love 
absolut beauti 

true he repli 

few are they who are abl to attain to the sight of thi 

veri true 

and he who have a sen of beauti thing ha no sen of absolut 
beauti or who if anoth lead him to a knowledg of that beauti is 
unabl to follow of such an one i ask is he awak or in a dream 
onli reflect is not the dreamer sleep or wake one who liken 
dissimilar thing who put the copi in the place of the real object 

i should certainli say that such an one wa dream 

but take the case of the other who recogni the exist of absolut 
beauti and is abl to distinguish the idea from the object which 
particip in the idea neither put the object in the place of the 
idea nor the idea in the place of the object is he a dreamer or is he 
awak 

he is wide awak 

and may we not say that the mind of the one who know ha knowledg and 
that the mind of the other who opin onli ha opinion 

certainli 

but suppo that the latter should quarrel with u and disput our 
statement can we administ ani sooth cordial or advic to him 
without reveal to him that there is sad disord in hi wit 

we must certainli offer him some good advic he repli 

come then and let u think of someth to say to him shall we begin 
by assur him that he is welcom to ani knowledg which he may have 
and that we are rejoic at hi have it but we should like to ask him 
a question doe he who ha knowledg know someth or noth you 
must answer for him 

i answer that he know someth 

someth that is or is not 

someth that is for how can that which is not ever be known 

and are we assur after look at the matter from mani point of 
view that absolut be is or may be absolut known but that the 
utterli non exist is utterli unknown 

noth can be more certain 

good but if there be anyth which is of such a natur a to be and 
not to be that will have a place intermedi between pure be and 
the absolut negat of be 

ye between them 

and a knowledg correspond to be and ignor of necess to 
not be for that intermedi between be and not be there ha 
to be discov a correspond intermedi between ignor and 
knowledg if there be such 

certainli 

do we admit the exist of opinion 

undoubtedli 

a be the same with knowledg or anoth faculti 

anoth faculti 

then opinion and knowledg have to do with differ kind of matter 
correspond to thi differ of faculti 

ye 

and knowledg is rel to be and know be but befor i proceed 
further i will make a divi 

what divi 

i will begin by place faculti in a class by themselv they are 
power in u and in all other thing by which we do a we do sight 
and hear for exampl i should call faculti have i clearli 
explain the class which i mean 

ye i quit understand 

then let me tell you my view about them i do not see them and 
therefor the distinct of figur colour and the like which enabl 
me to discern the differ of some thing do not appli to them in 
speak of a faculti i think onli of it sphere and it result and 
that which ha the same sphere and the same result i call the same 
faculti but that which ha anoth sphere and anoth result i call 
differ would that be your way of speak 

ye 

and will you be so veri good a to answer one more question would you 
say that knowledg is a faculti or in what class would you place it 

certainli knowledg is a faculti and the mightiest of all faculti 

and is opinion also a faculti 

certainli he said for opinion is that with which we are abl to form 
an opinion 

and yet you were acknowledg a littl while ago that knowledg is not 
the same a opinion 

whi ye he said how can ani reason be ever identifi that which 
is infal with that which err 

an excel answer prove i said that we are quit consciou of a 
distinct between them 

ye 

then knowledg and opinion have distinct power have also distinct 
sphere or subject matter 

that is certain 

be is the sphere or subject matter of knowledg and knowledg is to 
know the natur of be 

ye 

and opinion is to have an opinion 

ye 

and do we know what we opin or is the subject matter of opinion the 
same a the subject matter of knowledg 

nay he repli that ha been alreadi disproven if differ in 
faculti impli differ in the sphere or subject matter and if a 
we were say opinion and knowledg are distinct faculti then the 
sphere of knowledg and of opinion cannot be the same 

then if be is the subject matter of knowledg someth el must be 
the subject matter of opinion 

ye someth el 

well then is not be the subject matter of opinion or rather how 
can there be an opinion at all about not be reflect when a man 
ha an opinion ha he not an opinion about someth can he have an 
opinion which is an opinion about noth 

imposs 

he who ha an opinion ha an opinion about some one thing 

ye 

and not be is not one thing but properli speak noth 

true 

of not be ignor wa assum to be the necessari correl of 
be knowledg 

true he said 

then opinion is not concern either with be or with not be 

not with either 

and can therefor neither be ignor nor knowledg 

that seem to be true 

but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in 
a greater clear than knowledg or in a greater dark than 
ignor 

in neither 

then i suppo that opinion appear to you to be darker than knowledg 
but lighter than ignor 

both and in no small degr 

and also to be within and between them 

ye 

then you would infer that opinion is intermedi 

no question 

but were we not say befor that if anyth appear to be of a sort 
which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear 
also to lie in the interv between pure be and absolut not be 
and that the correspond faculti is neither knowledg nor ignor 
but will be found in the interv between them 

true 

and in that interv there ha now been discov someth which we 
call opinion 

there ha 

then what remain to be discov is the object which partak equal 
of the natur of be and not be and cannot rightli be term 
either pure and simpl thi unknown term when discov we may 
truli call the subject of opinion and assign each to their proper 
faculti the extrem to the faculti of the extrem and the mean to 
the faculti of the mean 

true 

thi be premi i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that 
there is no absolut or unchang idea of beauti in whose opinion 
the beauti is the manifold he i say your lover of beauti 
sight who cannot bear to be told that the beauti is one and the 
just is one or that anyth is one to him i would appeal say 
will you be so veri kind sir a to tell u whether of all these 
beauti thing there is one which will not be found ugli or of the 
just which will not be found unjust or of the holi which will not 
also be unholi 

no he repli the beauti will in some point of view be found ugli 
and the same is true of the rest 

and may not the mani which are doubl be also half doubl that 
is of one thing and half of anoth 

quit true 

and thing great and small heavi and light a they are term will 
not be denot by these ani more than by the opposit name 

true both these and the opposit name will alway attach to all of 
them 

and can ani one of those mani thing which are call by particular 
name be said to be thi rather than not to be thi 

he repli they are like the pun riddl which are ask at feast 
or the child s puzzl about the eunuch aim at the bat with 
what he hit him a they say in the puzzl and upon what the bat 
wa sit the individu object of which i am speak are also 
a riddl and have a doubl sen nor can you fix them in your mind 
either a be or not be or both or neither 

then what will you do with them i said can they have a better place 
than between be and not be for they are clearli not in greater 
dark or negat than not be or more full of light and exist 
than be 

that is quit true he said 

thu then we seem to have discov that the mani idea which the 
multitud entertain about the beauti and about all other thing are 
toss about in some region which is half way between pure be and 
pure not be 

we have 

ye and we had befor agr that anyth of thi kind which we might 
find wa to be describ a matter of opinion and not a matter of 
knowledg be the intermedi flux which is caught and detain by 
the intermedi faculti 

quit true 

then those who see the mani beauti and who yet neither see absolut 
beauti nor can follow ani guid who point the way thither who see the 
mani just and not absolut justic and the like such person may be 
said to have opinion but not knowledg 

that is certain 

but those who see the absolut and etern and immut may be said to 
know and not to have opinion onli 

neither can that be deni 

the one love and embrac the subject of knowledg the other those of 
opinion the latter are the same a i dare say you will rememb who 
listen to sweet sound and gaze upon fair colour but would not 
toler the exist of absolut beauti 

ye i rememb 

shall we then be guilti of ani improprieti in call them lover of 
opinion rather than lover of wisdom and will they be veri angri with 
u for thu describ them 

i shall tell them not to be angri no man should be angri at what is 
true 

but those who love the truth in each thing are to be call lover of 
wisdom and not lover of opinion 

assuredli 




book vi 

and thu glaucon after the argument ha gone a weari way the true and 
the fal philosoph have at length appear in view 

i do not think he said that the way could have been shorten 

i suppo not i said and yet i believ that we might have had a better 
view of both of them if the discu could have been confin to thi 
one subject and if there were not mani other question await u 
which he who desir to see in what respect the life of the just differ 
from that of the unjust must consid 

and what is the next question he ask 

sure i said the one which follow next in order inasmuch a 
philosoph onli are abl to grasp the etern and unchang 
and those who wander in the region of the mani and variabl are not 
philosoph i must ask you which of the two class should be the 
ruler of our state 

and how can we rightli answer that question 

whichev of the two are best abl to guard the law and institut of 
our state let them be our guardian 

veri good 

neither i said can there be ani question that the guardian who is to 
keep anyth should have eye rather than no eye 

there can be no question of that 

and are not those who are verili and ind want in the knowledg 
of the true be of each thing and who have in their soul no clear 
pattern and are unabl a with a painter s eye to look at the absolut 
truth and to that origin to repair and have perfect vision of the 
other world to order the law about beauti good justic in thi 
if not alreadi order and to guard and preserv the order of them are 
not such person i ask simpli blind 

truli he repli they are much in that condit 

and shall they be our guardian when there are other who besid be 
their equal in experi and fall short of them in no particular of 
virtu also know the veri truth of each thing 

there can be no reason he said for reject those who have thi 
greatest of all great qualiti they must alway have the first place 
unless they fail in some other respect 

suppo then i said that we determin how far they can unit thi and 
the other excel 

by all mean 

in the first place a we began by observ the natur of the 
philosoph ha to be ascertain we must come to an understand 
about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we 
shall also acknowledg that such an union of qualiti is possibl and 
that those in whom they are unit and those onli should be ruler in 
the state 

what do you mean 

let u suppo that philosoph mind alway love knowledg of a sort 
which show them the etern natur not vari from gener and 
corrupt 

agr 

and further i said let u agr that they are lover of all true 
be there is no part whether greater or le or more or le 
honour which they are will to renounc a we said befor of the 
lover and the man of ambit 

true 

and if they are to be what we were describ is there not anoth 
qualiti which they should also po 

what qualiti 

truth they will never intent receiv into their mind 
falsehood which is their detest and they will love the truth 

ye that may be safe affirm of them 

may be my friend i repli is not the word say rather must be 
affirm for he whose natur is amor of anyth cannot help love 
all that belong or is akin to the object of hi affect 

right he said 

and is there anyth more akin to wisdom than truth 

how can there be 

can the same natur be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood 

never 

the true lover of learn then must from hi earliest youth a far a 
in him lie desir all truth 

assuredli 

but then again a we know by experi he whose desir are strong 
in one direct will have them weaker in other they will be like a 
stream which ha been drawn off into anoth channel 

true 

he whose desir are drawn toward knowledg in everi form will be 
absorb in the pleasur of the soul and will hardli feel bodili 
pleasur i mean if he be a true philosoph and not a sham one 

that is most certain 

such an one is sure to be temper and the rever of covet for the 
motif which make anoth man desir of have and spend have no 
place in hi charact 

veri true 

anoth criterion of the philosoph natur ha also to be consid 

what is that 

there should be no secret corner of illib noth can be more 
antagonist than mean to a soul which is ever long after the 
whole of thing both divin and human 

most true he repli 

then how can he who ha magnif of mind and is the spectat of all 
time and all exist think much of human life 

he cannot 

or can such an one account death fear 

no ind 

then the cowardli and mean natur ha no part in true philosophi 

certainli not 

or again can he who is harmoni constitut who is not covet or 
mean or a boaster or a coward can he i say ever be unjust or hard 
in hi deal 

imposs 

then you will soon observ whether a man is just and gentl or rude 
and unsoci these are the sign which distinguish even in youth the 
philosoph natur from the unphilosoph 

true 

there is anoth point which should be remark 

what point 

whether he ha or ha not a pleasur in learn for no one will love 
that which give him pain and in which after much toil he make littl 
progress 

certainli not 

and again if he is forget and retain noth of what he learn 
will he not be an empti vessel 

that is certain 

labour in vain he must end in hate himself and hi fruitless 
occup ye 

then a soul which forget cannot be rank among genuin philosoph 
natur we must insist that the philosoph should have a good memori 

certainli 

and onc more the inharmoni and unseemli natur can onli tend to 
disproport 

undoubtedli 

and do you consid truth to be akin to proport or to disproport 

to proport 

then besid other qualiti we must tri to find a natur 
well proport and graciou mind which will move spontan 
toward the true be of everyth 

certainli 

well and do not all these qualiti which we have been enum go 
togeth and are they not in a manner necessari to a soul which is 
to have a full and perfect particip of be 

they are absolut necessari he repli 

and must not that be a blameless studi which he onli can pursu who ha 
the gift of a good memori and is quick to learn nobl graciou the 
friend of truth justic courag temper who are hi kindr 

the god of jealousi himself he said could find no fault with such a 
studi 

and to men like him i said when perfect by year and educ and 
to these onli you will entrust the state 

here adeimantu interpo and said to these statement socrat no 
one can offer a repli but when you talk in thi way a strang feel 
pa over the mind of your hearer they fanci that they are led 
astray a littl at each step in the argument owe to their own want of 
skill in ask and answer question these littl accumul and 
at the end of the discu they are found to have sustain a mighti 
overthrow and all their former notion appear to be turn upsid down 
and a unskil player of draught are at last shut up by their 
more skil adversari and have no piec to move so they too find 
themselv shut up at last for they have noth to say in thi new 
game of which word are the counter and yet all the time they are in 
the right the observ is suggest to me by what is now occur 
for ani one of u might say that although in word he is not abl 
to meet you at each step of the argument he see a a fact that the 
votari of philosophi when they carri on the studi not onli in youth 
a a part of educ but a the pursuit of their matur year most 
of them becom strang monster not to say utter rogu and that those 
who may be consid the best of them are made useless to the world by 
the veri studi which you extol 

well and do you think that those who say so are wrong 

i cannot tell he repli but i should like to know what is your 
opinion 

hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quit right 

then how can you be justifi in say that citi will not cea from 
evil until philosoph rule in them when philosoph are acknowledg 
by u to be of no use to them 

you ask a question i said to which a repli can onli be given in a 
parabl 

ye socrat and that is a way of speak to which you are not at all 
accustom i suppo 

i perceiv i said that you are vastli amu at have plung me into 
such a hopeless discu but now hear the parabl and then you will 
be still more amu at the meagr of my imagin for the manner 
in which the best men are treat in their own state is so grievou 
that no singl thing on earth is compar to it and therefor if 
i am to plead their cau i must have recour to fiction and put 
togeth a figur made up of mani thing like the fabul union of 
goat and stag which are found in pictur imagin then a fleet or a 
ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than ani of 
the crew but he is a littl deaf and ha a similar infirm in sight 
and hi knowledg of navig is not much better the sailor are 
quarrel with one anoth about the steer everi one is of opinion 
that he ha a right to steer though he ha never learn the art of 
navig and cannot tell who taught him or when he learn and will 
further assert that it cannot be taught and they are readi to cut in 
piec ani one who say the contrari they throng about the captain 
beg and pray him to commit the helm to them and if at ani time 
they do not prevail but other are prefer to them they kill the 
other or throw them overboard and have first chain up the nobl 
captain s sen with drink or some narcot drug they mutini and take 
poss of the ship and make free with the store thu eat 
and drink they proceed on their voyag in such manner a might be 
expect of them him who is their partisan and cleverli aid them in 
their plot for get the ship out of the captain s hand into their 
own whether by forc or persua they compliment with the name of 
sailor pilot abl seaman and abu the other sort of man whom they 
call a good for noth but that the true pilot must pay attent 
to the year and season and sky and star and wind and whatev el 
belong to hi art if he intend to be realli qualifi for the command 
of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other 
peopl like or not the possibl of thi union of author with the 
steerer s art ha never seriou enter into their thought or been 
made part of their call now in vessel which are in a state of 
mutini and by sailor who are mutin how will the true pilot be 
regard will he not be call by them a prater a star gazer a 
good for noth 

of cour said adeimantu 

then you will hardli need i said to hear the interpret of the 
figur which describ the true philosoph in hi relat to the 
state for you understand alreadi 

certainli 

then suppo you now take thi parabl to the gentleman who is surpri 
at find that philosoph have no honour in their citi explain 
it to him and tri to convinc him that their have honour would be far 
more extraordinari 

i will 

say to him that in deem the best votari of philosophi to be 
useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to 
attribut their useless to the fault of those who will not use them 
and not to themselv the pilot should not humbl beg the sailor to be 
command by him that is not the order of natur neither are the wise 
to go to the door of the rich the ingeni author of thi say 
told a lie but the truth is that when a man is ill whether he 
be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who want to 
be govern to him who is abl to govern the ruler who is good for 
anyth ought not to beg hi subject to be rule by him although 
the present governor of mankind are of a differ stamp they may be 
justli compar to the mutin sailor and the true helmsman to those 
who are call by them good for noth and star gazer 

preci so he said 

for these reason and among men like these philosophi the noblest 
pursuit of all is not like to be much esteem by those of the 
opposit faction not that the greatest and most last injuri is done 
to her by her oppon but by her own profess follow the same 
of whom you suppo the accu to say that the greater number of them 
are arrant rogu and the best are useless in which opinion i agr 

ye 

and the reason whi the good are useless ha now been explain 

true 

then shall we proceed to show that the corrupt of the major is 
also unavoid and that thi is not to be laid to the charg of 
philosophi ani more than the other 

by all mean 

and let u ask and answer in turn first go back to the descript 
of the gentl and nobl natur truth a you will rememb wa hi 
leader whom he follow alway and in all thing fail in thi he 
wa an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophi 

ye that wa said 

well and is not thi one qualiti to mention no other greatli at 
varianc with present notion of him 

certainli he said 

and have we not a right to say in hi defenc that the true lover of 
knowledg is alway strive after be that is hi natur he will 
not rest in the multipl of individu which is an appear onli 
but will go on the keen edg will not be blunt nor the forc of hi 
desir abat until he have attain the knowledg of the true natur 
of everi essenc by a sympathet and kindr power in the soul and by 
that power draw near and mingl and becom incorpor with veri 
be have begotten mind and truth he will have knowledg and will 
live and grow truli and then and not till then will he cea from hi 
travail 

noth he said can be more just than such a descript of him 

and will the love of a lie be ani part of a philosoph s natur will 
he not utterli hate a lie 

he will 

and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect ani evil of the band 
which he lead 

imposs 

justic and health of mind will be of the compani and temper will 
follow after 

true he repli 

neither is there ani reason whi i should again set in array the 
philosoph s virtu a you will doubtless rememb that courag 
magnif apprehen memori were hi natur gift and you 
object that although no one could deni what i then said still if 
you leav word and look at fact the person who are thu describ 
are some of them manifestli useless and the greater number utterli 
deprav we were then led to enquir into the ground of these 
accu and have now arriv at the point of ask whi are 
the major bad which question of necess brought u back to the 
examin and definit of the true philosoph 

exactli 

and we have next to consid the corrupt of the philosoph natur 
whi so mani are spoil and so few escap spoil i am speak of 
those who were said to be useless but not wick and when we have done 
with them we will speak of the imit of philosophi what manner of 
men are they who aspir after a profess which is abov them and of 
which they are unworthi and then by their manifold inconsist 
bring upon philosophi and upon all philosoph that univ 
reprob of which we speak 

what are these corrupt he said 

i will see if i can explain them to you everi one will admit that a 
natur have in perfect all the qualiti which we requir in a 
philosoph is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men 

rare ind 

and what numberless and power cau tend to destroy these rare 
natur 

what cau 

in the first place there are their own virtu their courag 
temper and the rest of them everi one of which praiseworthi 
qualiti and thi is a most singular circumst destroy and 
distract from philosophi the soul which is the possessor of them 

that is veri singular he repli 

then there are all the ordinari good of life beauti wealth strength 
rank and great connect in the state you understand the sort of 
thing these also have a corrupt and distract effect 

i understand but i should like to know more preci what you mean 
about them 

grasp the truth a a whole i said and in the right way you will then 
have no difficulti in apprehend the prece remark and they will 
no longer appear strang to you 

and how am i to do so he ask 

whi i said we know that all germ or seed whether veget or 
anim when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climat or soil 
in proport to their vigour are all the more sensit to the want of 
a suitabl environ for evil is a greater enemi to what is good than 
to what is not 

veri true 

there is reason in suppo that the finest natur when under alien 
condit receiv more injuri than the inferior becau the contrast 
is greater 

certainli 

and may we not say adeimantu that the most gift mind when they 
are ill educ becom pre emin bad do not great crime and 
the spirit of pure evil spring out of a ful of natur ruin by 
educ rather than from ani inferior wherea weak natur are 
scarc capabl of ani veri great good or veri great evil 

there i think that you are right 

and our philosoph follow the same analog he is like a plant which 
have proper nurtur must necessarili grow and matur into all virtu 
but if sown and plant in an alien soil becom the most noxiou of 
all weed unless he be preserv by some divin power do you realli 
think a peopl so often say that our youth are corrupt by sophist 
or that privat teacher of the art corrupt them in ani degr worth 
speak of are not the public who say these thing the greatest of all 
sophist and do they not educ to perfect young and old men and 
woman alik and fashion them after their own heart 

when is thi accomplish he said 

when they meet togeth and the world sit down at an assembl or in 
a court of law or a theatr or a camp or in ani other popular resort 
and there is a great uproar and they prai some thing which are 
be said or done and blame other thing equal exagg both 
shout and clap their hand and the echo of the rock and the 
place in which they are assembl redoubl the sound of the prai or 
blame at such a time will not a young man s heart a they say leap 
within him will ani privat train enabl him to stand firm against 
the overwhelm flood of popular opinion or will he be carri away 
by the stream will he not have the notion of good and evil which the 
public in gener have he will do a they do and a they are such 
will he be 

ye socrat necess will compel him 

and yet i said there is a still greater necess which ha not been 
mention 

what is that 

the gentl forc of attaind or confisc or death which a you 
are awar these new sophist and educ who are the public appli 
when their word are powerless 

ind they do and in right good earnest 

now what opinion of ani other sophist or of ani privat person can be 
expect to overcom in such an unequ contest 

none he repli 

no ind i said even to make the attempt is a great piec of folli 
there neither is nor ha been nor is ever like to be ani differ 
type of charact which ha had no other train in virtu but that 
which is suppli by public opinion i speak my friend of human virtu 
onli what is more than human a the proverb say is not includ 
for i would not have you ignor that in the present evil state of 
govern whatev is save and come to good is save by the power 
of god a we may truli say 

i quit assent he repli 

then let me crave your assent also to a further observ 

what are you go to say 

whi that all those mercenari individu whom the mani call sophist 
and whom they deem to be their adversari do in fact teach noth 
but the opinion of the mani that is to say the opinion of their 
assembl and thi is their wisdom i might compar them to a man who 
should studi the temper and desir of a mighti strong beast who is 
fed by him he would learn how to approach and handl him also at what 
time and from what cau he is danger or the rever and what 
is the mean of hi sever cri and by what sound when anoth 
utter them he is sooth or infuri and you may suppo further 
that when by continu attend upon him he ha becom perfect in 
all thi he call hi knowledg wisdom and make of it a system or 
art which he proce to teach although he ha no real notion of what 
he mean by the principl or passion of which he is speak but 
call thi honour and that dishonour or good or evil or just 
or unjust all in accord with the tast and temper of the great 
brute good he pronounc to be that in which the beast delight and 
evil to be that which he dislik and he can give no other account 
of them except that the just and nobl are the necessari have never 
himself seen and have no power of explain to other the natur 
of either or the differ between them which is immen by heaven 
would not such an one be a rare educ 

ind he would 

and in what way doe he who think that wisdom is the discern of 
the temper and tast of the motley multitud whether in paint 
or music or final in polit differ from him whom i have been 
describ for when a man consort with the mani and exhibit to 
them hi poem or other work of art or the servic which he ha done 
the state make them hi judg when he is not oblig the so call 
necess of diom will oblig him to produc whatev they 
prai and yet the reason are utterli ludicr which they give in 
confirm of their own notion about the honour and good did you 
ever hear ani of them which were not 

no nor am i like to hear 

you recogni the truth of what i have been say then let me ask you 
to consid further whether the world will ever be induc to believ in 
the exist of absolut beauti rather than of the mani beauti or 
of the absolut in each kind rather than of the mani in each kind 

certainli not 

then the world cannot possibl be a philosoph 

imposs 

and therefor philosoph must inevit fall under the censur of the 
world 

they must 

and of individu who consort with the mob and seek to plea them 

that is evid 

then do you see ani way in which the philosoph can be preserv in 
hi call to the end and rememb what we were say of him that 
he wa to have quick and memori and courag and magnif these 
were admit by u to be the true philosoph s gift 

ye 

will not such an one from hi earli childhood be in all thing first 
among all especi if hi bodili endow are like hi mental one 

certainli he said 

and hi friend and fellow citizen will want to use him a he get 
older for their own purpo 

no question 

fall at hi foot they will make request to him and do him honour 
and flatter him becau they want to get into their hand now the 
power which he will one day po 

that often happen he said 

and what will a man such a he is be like to do under such 
circumst especi if he be a citizen of a great citi rich 
and nobl and a tall proper youth will he not be full of boundless 
aspir and fanci himself abl to manag the affair of hellen 
and of barbarian and have got such notion into hi head will he 
not dilat and elev himself in the ful of vain pomp and senseless 
pride 

to be sure he will 

now when he is in thi state of mind if some one gentli come to him 
and tell him that he is a fool and must get understand which can 
onli be got by slave for it do you think that under such adver 
circumst he will be easili induc to listen 

far otherwi 

and even if there be some one who through inher good or natur 
reason ha had hi eye open a littl and is humbl and taken 
captiv by philosophi how will hi friend behav when they think that 
they are like to lose the advantag which they were hope to reap 
from hi companionship will they not do and say anyth to prevent him 
from yield to hi better natur and to render hi teacher powerless 
use to thi end privat intrigu a well a public prosecut 

there can be no doubt of it 

and how can one who is thu circumstanc ever becom a philosoph 

imposs 

then were we not right in say that even the veri qualiti which 
make a man a philosoph may if he be ill educ divert him from 
philosophi no le than rich and their accompani and the other 
so call good of life 

we were quit right 

thu my excel friend is brought about all that ruin and failur 
which i have been describ of the natur best adapt to the best of 
all pursuit they are natur which we maintain to be rare at ani time 
thi be the class out of which come the men who are the author of 
the greatest evil to state and individu and also of the greatest 
good when the tide carri them in that direct but a small man never 
wa the doer of ani great thing either to individu or to state 

that is most true he said 

and so philosophi is left desol with her marriag rite incomplet 
for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are 
lead a fal and unbecom life other unworthi person see that 
she ha no kinsman to be her protector enter in and dishonour her and 
fasten upon her the reproach which a you say her reprov utter 
who affirm of her votari that some are good for noth and that the 
greater number deserv the severest punish 

that is certainli what peopl say 

ye and what el would you expect i said when you think of the puni 
creatur who see thi land open to them a land well stock with 
fair name and showi titl like prison run out of prison into a 
sanctuari take a leap out of their trade into philosophi those who 
do so be probabl the cleverest hand at their own miser craft 
for although philosophi be in thi evil case still there remain a 
digniti about her which is not to be found in the art and mani are 
thu attract by her whose natur are imperfect and whose soul are 
maim and disfigur by their mean a their bodi are by their 
trade and craft is not thi unavoid 

ye 

are they not exactli like a bald littl tinker who ha just got out of 
duranc and come into a fortun he take a bath and put on a new coat 
and is deck out a a bridegroom go to marri hi master s daughter 
who is left poor and desol 

a most exact parallel 

what will be the issu of such marriag will they not be vile and 
bastard 

there can be no question of it 

and when person who are unworthi of educ approach philosophi and 
make an allianc with her who is in a rank abov them what sort of 
idea and opinion are like to be gener will they not be sophism 
captiv to the ear have noth in them genuin or worthi of or 
akin to true wisdom 

no doubt he said 

then adeimantu i said the worthi discipl of philosophi will be but 
a small remnant perchanc some nobl and well educ person detain 
by exil in her servic who in the absenc of corrupt influenc 
remain devot to her or some lofti soul born in a mean citi the 
polit of which he contemn and neglect and there may be a gift 
few who leav the art which they justli despi and come to her or 
peradventur there are some who are restrain by our friend theag 
bridl for everyth in the life of theag conspir to divert him 
from philosophi but ill health kept him away from polit my own case 
of the intern sign is hardli worth mention for rare if ever 
ha such a monitor been given to ani other man those who belong to thi 
small class have tast how sweet and bless a poss philosophi 
is and have also seen enough of the mad of the multitud and they 
know that no politician is honest nor is there ani champion of justic 
at whose side they may fight and be save such an one may be compar 
to a man who ha fallen among wild beast he will not join in the 
wick of hi fellow but neither is he abl singli to resist all 
their fierc natur and therefor see that he would be of no use to 
the state or to hi friend and reflect that he would have to throw 
away hi life without do ani good either to himself or other he 
hold hi peac and go hi own way he is like one who in the storm 
of dust and sleet which the drive wind hurri along retir 
under the shelter of a wall and see the rest of mankind full of 
wick he is content if onli he can live hi own life and be pure 
from evil or unright and depart in peac and good will with 
bright hope 

ye he said and he will have done a great work befor he depart 

a great work ye but not the greatest unless he find a state suitabl 
to him for in a state which is suitabl to him he will have a larger 
growth and be the saviour of hi countri a well a of himself 

the cau whi philosophi is in such an evil name have now been 
suffici explain the injust of the charg against her ha 
been shown is there anyth more which you wish to say 

noth more on that subject he repli but i should like to know 
which of the govern now exist is in your opinion the one adapt 
to her 

not ani of them i said and that is preci the accu which i 
bring against them not one of them is worthi of the philosoph natur 
and henc that natur is warp and estrang a the exot seed 
which is sown in a foreign land becom denatur and is wont to be 
overpow and to lose itself in the new soil even so thi growth 
of philosophi instead of persist degen and receiv anoth 
charact but if philosophi ever find in the state that perfect 
which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divin and 
that all other thing whether natur of men or institut are but 
human and now i know that you are go to ask what that state is 

no he said there you are wrong for i wa go to ask anoth 
question whether it is the state of which we are the founder and 
inventor or some other 

ye i repli our in most respect but you may rememb my say 
befor that some live author would alway be requir in the 
state have the same idea of the constitut which guid you when a 
legisl you were lay down the law 

that wa said he repli 

ye but not in a satisfactori manner you frighten u by interpo 
object which certainli show that the discu would be long and 
difficult and what still remain is the rever of easi 

what is there remain 

the question how the studi of philosophi may be so order a not to be 
the ruin of the state all great attempt are attend with risk hard 
is the good a men say 

still he said let the point be clear up and the enquiri will then 
be complet 

i shall not be hinder i said by ani want of will but if at all 
by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselv and plea to 
remark in what i am about to say how boldli and unhesitatingli i declar 
that state should pursu philosophi not a they do now but in a 
differ spirit 

in what manner 

at present i said the student of philosophi are quit young 
begin when they are hardli past childhood they devot onli the time 
save from moneymak and housekeep to such pursuit and even those 
of them who are reput to have most of the philosoph spirit when 
they come within sight of the great difficulti of the subject i mean 
dialect take themselv off in after life when invit by some one 
el they may perhap go and hear a lectur and about thi they make 
much ado for philosophi is not consid by them to be their 
proper busi at last when they grow old in most case they are 
extinguish more truli than heracleitu sun inasmuch a they never 
light up again heraclitu said that the sun wa extinguish everi 
even and relight everi morn 

but what ought to be their cour 

just the opposit in childhood and youth their studi and what 
philosophi they learn should be suit to their tender year dure 
thi period while they are grow up toward manhood the chief and 
special care should be given to their bodi that they may have them 
to use in the servic of philosophi a life advanc and the intellect 
begin to matur let them increa the gymnast of the soul but 
when the strength of our citizen fail and is past civil and militari 
duti then let them rang at will and engag in no seriou labour 
a we intend them to live happili here and to crown thi life with a 
similar happi in anoth 

how truli in earnest you are socrat he said i am sure of that and 
yet most of your hearer if i am not mistaken are like to be still 
more earnest in their opposit to you and will never be convinc 
thrasymachu least of all 

do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachu and me who have 
recent becom friend although ind we were never enemi for i 
shall go on strive to the utmost until i either convert him and other 
men or do someth which may profit them against the day when they 
live again and hold the like discour in anoth state of exist 

you are speak of a time which is not veri near 

rather i repli of a time which is a noth in comparison with 
etern nevertheless i do not wonder that the mani refu to believ 
for they have never seen that of which we are now speak realiz 
they have seen onli a convent imit of philosophi consist 
of word artifici brought togeth not like these of our have 
a natur uniti but a human be who in word and work is perfectli 
mould a far a he can be into the proport and like of 
virtu such a man rule in a citi which bear the same imag they 
have never yet seen neither one nor mani of them do you think that 
they ever did 

no ind 

no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and nobl 
sentiment such a men utter when they are earnestli and by everi mean 
in their power seek after truth for the sake of knowledg while 
they look coldli on the subtleti of controversi of which the end is 
opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the court of law or 
in societi 

they are stranger he said to the word of which you speak 

and thi wa what we foresaw and thi wa the reason whi truth forc 
u to admit not without fear and hesit that neither citi nor 
state nor individu will ever attain perfect until the small 
class of philosoph whom we term useless but not corrupt are 
providenti compel whether they will or not to take care of the 
state and until a like necess be laid on the state to obey them or 
until king or if not king the son of king or princ are divin 
inspir with a true love of true philosophi that either or both of 
these altern are imposs i see no reason to affirm if 
they were so we might ind be justli ridicul a dreamer and 
visionari am i not right 

quit right 

if then in the countless age of the past or at the present hour in 
some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfect 
philosoph is or ha been or hereaft shall be compel by a superior 
power to have the charg of the state we are readi to assert to the 
death that thi our constitut ha been and is yea and will be 
whenev the muse of philosophi is queen there is no imposs in 
all thi that there is a difficulti we acknowledg ourselv 

my opinion agr with your he said 

but do you mean to say that thi is not the opinion of the multitud 

i should imagin not he repli 

o my friend i said do not attack the multitud they will chang their 
mind if not in an aggress spirit but gentli and with the view 
of sooth them and remov their dislik of over educ you show 
them your philosoph a they realli are and describ a you were just 
now do their charact and profess and then mankind will see that 
he of whom you are speak is not such a they suppo if they view 
him in thi new light they will sure chang their notion of him and 
answer in anoth strain who can be at enmiti with one who love them 
who that is himself gentl and free from envi will be jealou of one 
in whom there is no jealousi nay let me answer for you that in a few 
thi harsh temper may be found but not in the major of mankind 

i quit agr with you he said 

and do you not also think a i do that the harsh feel which the 
mani entertain toward philosophi origin in the pretend who rush 
in uninvit and are alway abu them and find fault with them 
who make person instead of thing the theme of their conver and 
noth can be more unbecom in philosoph than thi 

it is most unbecom 

for he adeimantu whose mind is fix upon true be ha sure no 
time to look down upon the affair of earth or to be fill with malic 
and envi contend against men hi eye is ever direct toward 
thing fix and immut which he see neither injur nor injur 
by one anoth but all in order move accord to reason these he 
imit and to these he will a far a he can conform himself can a 
man help imit that with which he hold reverenti conver 

imposs 

and the philosoph hold conver with the divin order becom 
orderli and divin a far a the natur of man allow but like everi 
one el he will suffer from detract 

of cour 

and if a necess be laid upon him of fashion not onli himself 
but human natur gener whether in state or individu into 
that which he behold elsewh will he think you be an unskil 
artif of justic temper and everi civil virtu 

anyth but unskil 

and if the world perceiv that what we are say about him is the 
truth will they be angri with philosophi will they disbeliev u when 
we tell them that no state can be happi which is not design by artist 
who imit the heavenli pattern 

they will not be angri if they understand he said but how will they 
draw out the plan of which you are speak 

they will begin by take the state and the manner of men from which 
a from a tablet they will rub out the pictur and leav a clean 
surfac thi is no easi task but whether easi or not herein will lie 
the differ between them and everi other legisl they will have 
noth to do either with individu or state and will inscrib no 
law until they have either found or themselv made a clean surfac 

they will be veri right he said 

have effect thi they will proceed to trace an outlin of the 
constitut 

no doubt 

and when they are fill in the work a i conceiv they will often 
turn their eye upward and downward i mean that they will first look 
at absolut justic and beauti and temper and again at the human 
copi and will mingl and temper the variou element of life into the 
imag of a man and thi they will conceiv accord to that other 
imag which when exist among men homer call the form and like 
of god 

veri true he said 

and one featur they will era and anoth they will put in until 
they have made the way of men a far a possibl agreeabl to the 
way of god 

ind he said in no way could they make a fairer pictur 

and now i said are we begin to persuad those whom you describ 
a rush at u with might and main that the painter of constitut 
is such an one a we are prai at whom they were so veri indign 
becau to hi hand we commit the state and are they grow a 
littl calmer at what they have just heard 

much calmer if there is ani sen in them 

whi where can they still find ani ground for object will they doubt 
that the philosoph is a lover of truth and be 

they would not be so unreason 

or that hi natur be such a we have delin is akin to the 
highest good 

neither can they doubt thi 

but again will they tell u that such a natur place under favour 
circumst will not be perfectli good and wise if ani ever wa or 
will they prefer those whom we have reject 

sure not 

then will they still be angri at our say that until philosoph 
bear rule state and individu will have no rest from evil nor will 
thi our imaginari state ever be realiz 

i think that they will be le angri 

shall we assum that they are not onli le angri but quit gentl 
and that they have been convert and for veri shame if for no other 
reason cannot refu to come to term 

by all mean he said 

then let u suppo that the reconcili ha been effect will ani 
one deni the other point that there may be son of king or princ who 
are by natur philosoph 

sure no man he said 

and when they have come into be will ani one say that they must of 
necess be destroy that they can hardli be save is not deni even 
by u but that in the whole cour of age no singl one of them can 
escap who will ventur to affirm thi 

who ind 

but said i one is enough let there be one man who ha a citi obedi 
to hi will and he might bring into exist the ideal politi about 
which the world is so incredul 

ye one is enough 

the ruler may impo the law and institut which we have been 
describ and the citizen may possibl be will to obey them 

certainli 

and that other should approv of what we approv is no miracl or 
imposs 

i think not 

but we have suffici shown in what ha prece that all thi if 
onli possibl is assuredli for the best 

we have 

and now we say not onli that our law if they could be enact would 
be for the best but also that the enact of them though difficult 
is not imposs 

veri good 

and so with pain and toil we have reach the end of one subject but 
more remain to be discu how and by what studi and pursuit will 
the saviour of the constitut be creat and at what age are they 
to appli themselv to their sever studi 

certainli 

i omit the troublesom busi of the poss of woman and the 
procreat of child and the appoint of the ruler becau 
i knew that the perfect state would be eye with jealousi and wa 
difficult of attain but that piec of clever wa not of much 
servic to me for i had to discu them all the same the woman and 
child are now dispo of but the other question of the ruler must 
be investig from the veri begin we were say a you will 
rememb that they were to be lover of their countri tri by the 
test of pleasur and pain and neither in hardship nor in danger 
nor at ani other critic moment were to lose their patriot he wa 
to be reject who fail but he who alway came forth pure like gold 
tri in the refin s fire wa to be made a ruler and to receiv 
honour and reward in life and after death thi wa the sort of thing 
which wa be said and then the argument turn asid and veil her 
face not like to stir the question which ha now arisen 

i perfectli rememb he said 

ye my friend i said and i then shrank from hazard the bold 
word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must be a 
philosoph 

ye he said let that be affirm 

and do not suppo that there will be mani of them for the gift which 
were deem by u to be essenti rare grow togeth they are mostli 
found in shred and patch 

what do you mean he said 

you are awar i repli that quick intellig memori sagac 
clever and similar qualiti do not often grow togeth and that 
person who po them and are at the same time high spirit and 
magnanim are not so constitut by natur a to live orderli and in a 
peac and settl manner they are driven ani way by their impul 
and all solid principl go out of them 

veri true he said 

on the other hand those steadfast natur which can better be depend 
upon which in a battl are impregn to fear and immov are 
equal immov when there is anyth to be learn they are 
alway in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over ani 
intellectu toil 

quit true 

and yet we were say that both qualiti were necessari in those to 
whom the higher educ is to be impart and who are to share in ani 
offic or command 

certainli he said 

and will they be a class which is rare found 

ye ind 

then the aspir must not onli be test in those labour and danger 
and pleasur which we mention befor but there is anoth kind of 
probat which we did not mention he must be exerci also in mani 
kind of knowledg to see whether the soul will be abl to endur the 
highest of all or will faint under them a in ani other studi and 
exerci 

ye he said you are quit right in test him but what do you mean 
by the highest of all knowledg 

you may rememb i said that we divid the soul into three part and 
distinguish the sever natur of justic temper courag and 
wisdom 

ind he said if i had forgotten i should not deserv to hear more 

and do you rememb the word of caution which prece the discu of 
them 

to what do you refer 

we were say if i am not mistaken that he who want to see them in 
their perfect beauti must take a longer and more circuit way at 
the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a popular 
exposit of them on a level with the discu which had prece 
and you repli that such an exposit would be enough for you and so 
the enquiri wa continu in what to me seem to be a veri inaccur 
manner whether you were satisfi or not it is for you to say 

ye he said i thought and the other thought that you gave u a fair 
measur of truth 

but my friend i said a measur of such thing which in ani degr 
fall short of the whole truth is not fair measur for noth 
imperfect is the measur of anyth although person are too apt to be 
content and think that they need search no further 

not an uncommon case when peopl are indol 

ye i said and there cannot be ani wor fault in a guardian of the 
state and of the law 

true 

the guardian then i said must be requir to take the longer circuit 
and toil at learn a well a at gymnast or he will never reach 
the highest knowledg of all which a we were just now say is hi 
proper call 

what he said is there a knowledg still higher than thi higher than 
justic and the other virtu 

ye i said there is and of the virtu too we must behold not the 
outlin mere a at present noth short of the most finish 
pictur should satisfi u when littl thing are elabor with an 
infin of pain in order that they may appear in their full beauti 
and utmost clear how ridicul that we should not think the 
highest truth worthi of attain the highest accuraci 

a right nobl thought but do you suppo that we shall refrain from 
ask you what is thi highest knowledg 

nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the 
answer mani time and now you either do not understand me or a i 
rather think you are dispo to be troublesom for you have often 
been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledg and that all 
other thing becom use and advantag onli by their use of thi 
you can hardli be ignor that of thi i wa about to speak concern 
which a you have often heard me say we know so littl and without 
which ani other knowledg or poss of ani kind will profit u 
noth do you think that the poss of all other thing is of 
ani valu if we do not po the good or the knowledg of all other 
thing if we have no knowledg of beauti and good 

assuredli not 

you are further awar that most peopl affirm pleasur to be the good 
but the finer sort of wit say it is knowledg 

ye 

and you are awar too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by 
knowledg but are oblig after all to say knowledg of the good 

how ridicul 

ye i said that they should begin by reproach u with our ignor 
of the good and then presum our knowledg of it for the good they 
defin to be knowledg of the good just a if we understood them when 
they use the term good thi is of cour ridicul 

most true he said 

and those who make pleasur their good are in equal perplex for they 
are compel to admit that there are bad pleasur a well a good 

certainli 

and therefor to acknowledg that bad and good are the same 

true 

there can be no doubt about the numer difficulti in which thi 
question is involv 

there can be none 

further do we not see that mani are will to do or to have or to seem 
to be what is just and honour without the realiti but no one is 
satisfi with the appear of good the realiti is what they seek in 
the case of the good appear is despi by everi one 

veri true he said 

of thi then which everi soul of man pursu and make the end of all 
hi action have a presenti that there is such an end and 
yet hesit becau neither know the natur nor have the same 
assur of thi a of other thing and therefor lose whatev 
good there is in other thing of a principl such and so great a thi 
ought the best men in our state to whom everyth is entrust to be 
in the dark of ignor 

certainli not he said 

i am sure i said that he who doe not know how the beauti and 
the just are likewi good will be but a sorri guardian of them and 
i suspect that no one who is ignor of the good will have a true 
knowledg of them 

that he said is a shrewd suspicion of your 

and if we onli have a guardian who ha thi knowledg our state will be 
perfectli order 

of cour he repli but i wish that you would tell me whether you 
conceiv thi suprem principl of the good to be knowledg or pleasur 
or differ from either 

aye i said i knew all along that a fastidi gentleman like you would 
not be content with the thought of other peopl about these matter 

true socrat but i must say that one who like you ha pa a 
lifetim in the studi of philosophi should not be alway repeat the 
opinion of other and never tell hi own 

well but ha ani one a right to say posit what he doe not know 

not he said with the assur of posit certainti he ha no right 
to do that but he may say what he think a a matter of opinion 

and do you not know i said that all mere opinion are bad and the 
best of them blind you would not deni that those who have ani true 
notion without intellig are onli like blind men who feel their way 
along the road 

veri true 

and do you wish to behold what is blind and crook and base when 
other will tell you of bright and beauti 

still i must implor you socrat said glaucon not to turn away just 
a you are reach the goal if you will onli give such an explan 
of the good a you have alreadi given of justic and temper and the 
other virtu we shall be satisfi 

ye my friend and i shall be at least equal satisfi but i cannot 
help fear that i shall fail and that my indiscreet zeal will bring 
ridicul upon me no sweet sir let u not at present ask what is the 
actual natur of the good for to reach what is now in my thought 
would be an effort too great for me but of the child of the good who 
is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wish to 
hear otherwi not 

by all mean he said tell u about the child and you shall remain in 
our debt for the account of the parent 

i do ind wish i repli that i could pay and you receiv the 
account of the parent and not a now of the offspr onli take 
howev thi latter by way of interest and at the same time have a 
care that i do not render a fal account although i have no intent 
of deceiv you 

ye we will take all the care that we can proceed 

ye i said but i must first come to an understand with you and 
remind you of what i have mention in the cour of thi discu 
and at mani other time 

what 

the old stori that there is a mani beauti and a mani good and so 
of other thing which we describ and defin to all of them the term 
mani is appli 

true he said 

and there is an absolut beauti and an absolut good and of other 
thing to which the term mani is appli there is an absolut for 
they may be brought under a singl idea which is call the essenc of 
each 

veri true 

the mani a we say are seen but not known and the idea are known but 
not seen 

exactli 

and what is the organ with which we see the visibl thing 

the sight he said 

and with the hear i said we hear and with the other sen 
perceiv the other object of sen 

true 

but have you remark that sight is by far the most costli and complex 
piec of workmanship which the artif of the sen ever contriv 

no i never have he said 

then reflect ha the ear or voic need of ani third or addit 
natur in order that the one may be abl to hear and the other to be 
heard 

noth of the sort 

no ind i repli and the same is true of most if not all the 
other sen you would not say that ani of them requir such an 
addit 

certainli not 

but you see that without the addit of some other natur there is no 
see or be seen 

how do you mean 

sight be a i conceiv in the eye and he who ha eye want to 
see colour be also present in them still unless there be a third 
natur special adapt to the purpo the owner of the eye will see 
noth and the colour will be invi 

of what natur are you speak 

of that which you term light i repli 

true he said 

nobl then is the bond which link togeth sight and visibl and 
great beyond other bond by no small differ of natur for light is 
their bond and light is no ignobl thing 

nay he said the rever of ignobl 

and which i said of the god in heaven would you say wa the lord of 
thi element whose is that light which make the eye to see perfectli 
and the visibl to appear 

you mean the sun a you and all mankind say 

may not the relat of sight to thi deiti be describ a follow 

how 

neither sight nor the eye in which sight resid is the sun 

no 

yet of all the organ of sen the eye is the most like the sun 

by far the most like 

and the power which the eye po is a sort of effluenc which is 
dispen from the sun 

exactli 

then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recogni by 
sight 

true he said 

and thi is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in 
hi own like to be in the visibl world in relat to sight 
and the thing of sight what the good is in the intellectu world in 
relat to mind and the thing of mind 

will you be a littl more explicit he said 

whi you know i said that the eye when a person direct them toward 
object on which the light of day is no longer shine but the moon 
and star onli see dimli and are nearli blind they seem to have no 
clear of vision in them 

veri true 

but when they are direct toward object on which the sun shine they 
see clearli and there is sight in them 

certainli 

and the soul is like the eye when rest upon that on which truth and 
be shine the soul perceiv and understand and is radiant with 
intellig but when turn toward the twilight of becom and 
perish then she ha opinion onli and go blink about and 
is first of one opinion and then of anoth and seem to have no 
intellig 

just so 

now that which impart truth to the known and the power of know to 
the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and thi 
you will deem to be the cau of scienc and of truth in so far a 
the latter becom the subject of knowledg beauti too a are both 
truth and knowledg you will be right in esteem thi other natur a 
more beauti than either and a in the previou instanc light and 
sight may be truli said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun 
so in thi other sphere scienc and truth may be deem to be like the 
good but not the good the good ha a place of honour yet higher 

what a wonder of beauti that must be he said which is the author of 
scienc and truth and yet surpass them in beauti for you sure 
cannot mean to say that pleasur is the good 

god forbid i repli but may i ask you to consid the imag in 
anoth point of view 

in what point of view 

you would say would you not that the sun is not onli the author of 
visibl in all visibl thing but of gener and nourish and 
growth though he himself is not gener 

certainli 

in like manner the good may be said to be not onli the author of 
knowledg to all thing known but of their be and essenc and yet 
the good is not essenc but far exc essenc in digniti and power 

glaucon said with a ludicr earnest by the light of heaven how 
amaz 

ye i said and the exagg may be set down to you for you made 
me utter my fanci 

and pray continu to utter them at ani rate let u hear if there is 
anyth more to be said about the similitud of the sun 

ye i said there is a great deal more 

then omit noth howev slight 

i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will 
have to be omit 

i hope not he said 

you have to imagin then that there are two rule power and that 
one of them is set over the intellectu world the other over the 
visibl i do not say heaven lest you should fanci that i am play 
upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz may i suppo that you have thi 
distinct of the visibl and intellig fix in your mind 

i have 

now take a line which ha been cut into two unequ part and divid 
each of them again in the same proport and suppo the two 
main divi to answer one to the visibl and the other to the 
intellig and then compar the subdivi in respect of their 
clear and want of clear and you will find that the first 
section in the sphere of the visibl consist of imag and by imag i 
mean in the first place shadow and in the second place reflect 
in water and in solid smooth and polish bodi and the like do you 
understand 

ye i understand 

imagin now the other section of which thi is onli the resembl 
to includ the anim which we see and everyth that grow or is 
made 

veri good 

would you not admit that both the section of thi divi have 
differ degr of truth and that the copi is to the origin a the 
sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledg 

most undoubtedli 

next proceed to consid the manner in which the sphere of the 
intellectu is to be divid 

in what manner 

thu there are two subdivi in the lower of which the soul u 
the figur given by the former divi a imag the enquiri can onli 
be hypothet and instead of go upward to a principl descend 
to the other end in the higher of the two the soul pa out of 
hypothesi and go up to a principl which is abov hypothesi make 
no use of imag a in the former case but proceed onli in and 
through the idea themselv 

i do not quit understand your mean he said 

then i will tri again you will understand me better when i have made 
some preliminari remark you are awar that student of geometri 
arithmet and the kindr scienc assum the odd and the even and the 
figur and three kind of angl and the like in their sever branch 
of scienc these are their hypothesi which they and everi bodi are 
suppo to know and therefor they do not deign to give ani account of 
them either to themselv or other but they begin with them and go 
on until they arriv at last and in a consist manner at their 
conclu 

ye he said i know 

and do you not know also that although they make use of the visibl 
form and reason about them they are think not of these but of the 
ideal which they resembl not of the figur which they draw but 
of the absolut squar and the absolut diamet and so on the form 
which they draw or make and which have shadow and reflect in water 
of their own are convert by them into imag but they are realli 
seek to behold the thing themselv which can onli be seen with the 
eye of the mind 

that is true 

and of thi kind i spoke a the intellig although in the search 
after it the soul is compel to use hypothesi not ascend to 
a first principl becau she is unabl to rise abov the region of 
hypothesi but employ the object of which the shadow below are 
resembl in their turn a imag they have in relat to the 
shadow and reflect of them a greater distinct and therefor a 
higher valu 

i understand he said that you are speak of the provinc of geometri 
and the sister art 

and when i speak of the other divi of the intellig you will 
understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledg which reason 
herself attain by the power of dialect use the hypothesi not a 
first principl but onli a hypothesi that is to say a step and 
point of departur into a world which is abov hypothesi in order 
that she may soar beyond them to the first principl of the whole and 
cling to thi and then to that which depend on thi by success 
step she descend again without the aid of ani sensibl object from 
idea through idea and in idea she end 

i understand you he repli not perfectli for you seem to me to 
be describ a task which is realli tremend but at ani rate i 
understand you to say that knowledg and be which the scienc of 
dialect contempl are clearer than the notion of the art a 
they are term which proceed from hypothesi onli these are also 
contempl by the understand and not by the sen yet becau 
they start from hypothesi and do not ascend to a principl those who 
contempl them appear to you not to exerci the higher reason 
upon them although when a first principl is ad to them they are 
cogniz by the higher reason and the habit which is concern 
with geometri and the cognat scienc i suppo that you would term 
understand and not reason a be intermedi between opinion and 
reason 

you have quit conceiv my mean i said and now correspond to 
these four divi let there be four faculti in the soul reason 
answer to the highest understand to the second faith or 
convict to the third and percept of shadow to the last and let 
there be a scale of them and let u suppo that the sever faculti 
have clear in the same degr that their object have truth 

i understand he repli and give my assent and accept your 
arrang 




book vii 

and now i said let me show in a figur how far our natur is 
enlighten or unenlighten behold human be live in a 
underground den which ha a mouth open toward the light and reach 
all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have 
their leg and neck chain so that they cannot move and can onli 
see befor them be prevent by the chain from turn round 
their head abov and behind them a fire is blaze at a distanc and 
between the fire and the prison there is a rai way and you will 
see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which 
marionett player have in front of them over which they show the 
puppet 

i see 

and do you see i said men pa along the wall carri all sort of 
vessel and statu and figur of anim made of wood and stone and 
variou materi which appear over the wall some of them are talk 
other silent 

you have shown me a strang imag and they are strang prison 

like ourselv i repli and they see onli their own shadow or the 
shadow of one anoth which the fire throw on the opposit wall of 
the cave 

true he said how could they see anyth but the shadow if they were 
never allow to move their head 

and of the object which are be carri in like manner they would 
onli see the shadow 

ye he said 

and if they were abl to conver with one anoth would they not 
suppo that they were name what wa actual befor them 

veri true 

and suppo further that the prison had an echo which came from the 
other side would they not be sure to fanci when one of the passer by 
spoke that the voic which they heard came from the pa shadow 

no question he repli 

to them i said the truth would be liter noth but the shadow of 
the imag 

that is certain 

and now look again and see what will natur follow if the prison 
are relea and disabu of their error at first when ani of them is 
liber and compel suddenli to stand up and turn hi neck round and 
walk and look toward the light he will suffer sharp pain the glare 
will distress him and he will be unabl to see the realiti of which 
in hi former state he had seen the shadow and then conceiv some one 
say to him that what he saw befor wa an illu but that now 
when he is approach nearer to be and hi eye is turn toward 
more real exist he ha a clearer vision what will be hi repli 
and you may further imagin that hi instructor is point to the 
object a they pa and requir him to name them will he not be 
perplex will he not fanci that the shadow which he formerli saw are 
truer than the object which are now shown to him 

far truer 

and if he is compel to look straight at the light will he not have 
a pain in hi eye which will make him turn away to take refug in the 
object of vision which he can see and which he will conceiv to be in 
realiti clearer than the thing which are now be shown to him 

true he said 

and suppo onc more that he is reluctantli drag up a steep and 
rug ascent and held fast until he is forc into the presenc of 
the sun himself is he not like to be pain and irrit when he 
approach the light hi eye will be dazzl and he will not be abl 
to see anyth at all of what are now call realiti 

not all in a moment he said 

he will requir to grow accustom to the sight of the upper world 
and first he will see the shadow best next the reflect of men and 
other object in the water and then the object themselv then he 
will gaze upon the light of the moon and the star and the spangl 
heaven and he will see the sky and the star by night better than the 
sun or the light of the sun by day 

certainli 

last of all he will be abl to see the sun and not mere reflect of 
him in the water but he will see him in hi own proper place and not 
in anoth and he will contempl him a he is 

certainli 

he will then proceed to argu that thi is he who give the season and 
the year and is the guardian of all that is in the visibl world and 
in a certain way the cau of all thing which he and hi fellow have 
been accustom to behold 

clearli he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him 

and when he rememb hi old habit and the wisdom of the den 
and hi fellow prison do you not suppo that he would felicit 
himself on the chang and piti them 

certainli he would 

and if they were in the habit of confer honour among themselv 
on those who were quickest to observ the pa shadow and to remark 
which of them went befor and which follow after and which were 
togeth and who were therefor best abl to draw conclu a to the 
futur do you think that he would care for such honour and glori or 
envi the possessor of them would he not say with homer 

better to be the poor servant of a poor master 

and to endur anyth rather than think a they do and live after 
their manner 

ye he said i think that he would rather suffer anyth than 
entertain these fal notion and live in thi miser manner 

imagin onc more i said such an one come suddenli out of the sun 
to be replac in hi old situat would he not be certain to have hi 
eye full of dark 

to be sure he said 

and if there were a contest and he had to compet in measur the 
shadow with the prison who had never move out of the den while 
hi sight wa still weak and befor hi eye had becom steadi and the 
time which would be need to acquir thi new habit of sight might be 
veri consid would he not be ridicul men would say of him 
that up he went and down he came without hi eye and that it wa 
better not even to think of ascend and if ani one tri to loo 
anoth and lead him up to the light let them onli catch the offend 
and they would put him to death 

no question he said 

thi entir allegori i said you may now append dear glaucon to the 
previou argument the prison hou is the world of sight the light of 
the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret 
the journey upward to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectu 
world accord to my poor belief which at your desir i have 
express whether rightli or wrongli god know but whether true or 
fal my opinion is that in the world of knowledg the idea of good 
appear last of all and is seen onli with an effort and when seen 
is also infer to be the univ author of all thing beauti and 
right parent of light and of the lord of light in thi visibl world 
and the immedi sourc of reason and truth in the intellectu and 
that thi is the power upon which he who would act ration either in 
public or privat life must have hi eye fix 

i agr he said a far a i am abl to understand you 

moreov i said you must not wonder that those who attain to thi 
beatif vision are unwil to descend to human affair for their 
soul are ever hasten into the upper world where they desir to 
dwell which desir of their is veri natur if our allegori may be 
trust 

ye veri natur 

and is there anyth surpri in one who pa from divin 
contempl to the evil state of man misbehav himself in a 
ridicul manner if while hi eye are blink and befor he ha 
becom accustom to the surround dark he is compel to fight 
in court of law or in other place about the imag or the shadow of 
imag of justic and is endeavour to meet the concept of those 
who have never yet seen absolut justic 

anyth but surpri he repli 

ani one who ha common sen will rememb that the bewild of the 
eye are of two kind and ari from two cau either from come out 
of the light or from go into the light which is true of the mind s 
eye quit a much a of the bodili eye and he who rememb thi when 
he see ani one whose vision is perplex and weak will not be too 
readi to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man ha come out 
of the brighter life and is unabl to see becau unaccustom to the 
dark or have turn from dark to the day is dazzl by excess 
of light and he will count the one happi in hi condit and state of 
be and he will piti the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the 
soul which come from below into the light there will be more reason 
in thi than in the laugh which greet him who return from abov out of 
the light into the den 

that he said is a veri just distinct 

but then if i am right certain professor of educ must be wrong 
when they say that they can put a knowledg into the soul which wa not 
there befor like sight into blind eye 

they undoubtedli say thi he repli 

wherea our argument show that the power and capac of learn 
exist in the soul alreadi and that just a the eye wa unabl to turn 
from dark to light without the whole bodi so too the instrument of 
knowledg can onli by the movement of the whole soul be turn from the 
world of becom into that of be and learn by degr to endur 
the sight of be and of the brightest and best of be or in other 
word of the good 

veri true 

and must there not be some art which will effect conver in the 
easiest and quickest manner not implant the faculti of sight for 
that exist alreadi but ha been turn in the wrong direct and is 
look away from the truth 

ye he said such an art may be presum 

and wherea the other so call virtu of the soul seem to be akin to 
bodili qualiti for even when they are not origin innat they can 
be implant later by habit and exerci the virtu of wisdom more than 
anyth el contain a divin element which alway remain and by 
thi conver is render use and profit or on the other 
hand hurt and useless did you never observ the narrow intellig 
flash from the keen eye of a clever rogu how eager he is how 
clearli hi paltri soul see the way to hi end he is the rever of 
blind but hi keen eye sight is forc into the servic of evil and he 
is mischiev in proport to hi clever 

veri true he said 

but what if there had been a circumci of such natur in the day 
of their youth and they had been sever from those sensual pleasur 
such a eat and drink which like leaden weight were attach 
to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision 
of their soul upon the thing that are below if i say they had been 
relea from these impedi and turn in the opposit direct 
the veri same faculti in them would have seen the truth a keenli a 
they see what their eye are turn to now 

veri like 

ye i said and there is anoth thing which is like or rather a 
necessari infer from what ha prece that neither the uneduc 
and uninform of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of 
their educ will be abl minist of state not the former 
becau they have no singl aim of duti which is the rule of all their 
action privat a well a public nor the latter becau they will 
not act at all except upon compul fanci that they are alreadi 
dwell apart in the island of the blest 

veri true he repli 

then i said the busi of u who are the founder of the state 
will be to compel the best mind to attain that knowledg which we have 
alreadi shown to be the greatest of all they must continu to ascend 
until they arriv at the good but when they have ascend and seen 
enough we must not allow them to do a they do now 

what do you mean 

i mean that they remain in the upper world but thi must not be 
allow they must be made to descend again among the prison in the 
den and partak of their labour and honour whether they are worth 
have or not 

but is not thi unjust he said ought we to give them a wor life 
when they might have a better 

you have again forgotten my friend i said the intent of the 
legisl who did not aim at make ani one class in the state happi 
abov the rest the happi wa to be in the whole state and he 
held the citizen togeth by persua and necess make them 
benefactor of the state and therefor benefactor of one anoth 
to thi end he creat them not to plea themselv but to be hi 
instrument in bind up the state 

true he said i had forgotten 

observ glaucon that there will be no injust in compel our 
philosoph to have a care and provid of other we shall explain 
to them that in other state men of their class are not oblig to 
share in the toil of polit and thi is reason for they grow up 
at their own sweet will and the govern would rather not have them 
be self taught they cannot be expect to show ani gratitud for a 
cultur which they have never receiv but we have brought you into 
the world to be ruler of the hive king of yourselv and of the other 
citizen and have educ you far better and more perfectli than they 
have been educ and you are better abl to share in the doubl duti 
wherefor each of you when hi turn come must go down to the gener 
underground abod and get the habit of see in the dark when you 
have acquir the habit you will see ten thousand time better than the 
inhabit of the den and you will know what the sever imag are 
and what they repr becau you have seen the beauti and just 
and good in their truth and thu our state which is also your will 
be a realiti and not a dream onli and will be administ in a spirit 
unlik that of other state in which men fight with one anoth about 
shadow onli and are distract in the struggl for power which in 
their eye is a great good wherea the truth is that the state in which 
the ruler are most reluct to govern is alway the best and most 
quietli govern and the state in which they are most eager the worst 

quit true he repli 

and will our pupil when they hear thi refu to take their turn at 
the toil of state when they are allow to spend the greater part of 
their time with one anoth in the heavenli light 

imposs he answer for they are just men and the command which 
we impo upon them are just there can be no doubt that everi one of 
them will take offic a a stern necess and not after the fashion of 
our present ruler of state 

ye my friend i said and there lie the point you must contriv for 
your futur ruler anoth and a better life than that of a ruler and 
then you may have a well order state for onli in the state which 
offer thi will they rule who are truli rich not in silver and gold 
but in virtu and wisdom which are the true bless of life wherea 
if they go to the administr of public affair poor and hunger 
after their own privat advantag think that henc they are to 
snatch the chief good order there can never be for they will be 
fight about offic and the civil and domest broil which thu 
ari will be the ruin of the ruler themselv and of the whole state 

most true he repli 

and the onli life which look down upon the life of polit ambit 
is that of true philosophi do you know of ani other 

ind i do not he said 

and those who govern ought not to be lover of the task for if they 
are there will be rival lover and they will fight 

no question 

who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardian sure they 
will be the men who are wisest about affair of state and by whom the 
state is best administ and who at the same time have other honour 
and anoth and a better life than that of polit 

they are the men and i will choo them he repli 

and now shall we consid in what way such guardian will be produc 
and how they are to be brought from dark to light a some are said 
to have ascend from the world below to the god 

by all mean he repli 

the process i said is not the turn over of an oyster shell in 
allu to a game in which two parti fled or pursu accord a an 
oyster shell which wa thrown into the air fell with the dark or light 
side uppermost but the turn round of a soul pa from a day 
which is littl better than night to the true day of be that is the 
ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophi 

quit so 

and should we not enquir what sort of knowledg ha the power of 
effect such a chang 

certainli 

what sort of knowledg is there which would draw the soul from becom 
to be and anoth consid ha just occur to me you will 
rememb that our young men are to be warrior athlet 

ye that wa said 

then thi new kind of knowledg must have an addit qualiti 

what qualiti 

use in war 

ye if possibl 

there were two part in our former scheme of educ were there not 

just so 

there wa gymnast which presid over the growth and decay of the 
bodi and may therefor be regard a have to do with gener and 
corrupt 

true 

then that is not the knowledg which we are seek to discov 

no 

but what do you say of music which also enter to a certain extent 
into our former scheme 

music he said a you will rememb wa the counterpart of gymnast 
and train the guardian by the influenc of habit by harmoni make 
them harmoni by rhythm rhythmic but not give them scienc and 
the word whether fabul or possibl true had kindr element of 
rhythm and harmoni in them but in music there wa noth which tend 
to that good which you are now seek 

you are most accur i said in your recollect in music there 
certainli wa noth of the kind but what branch of knowledg is 
there my dear glaucon which is of the desir natur sinc all the 
use art were reckon mean by u 

undoubtedli and yet if music and gymnast are exclud and the art 
are also exclud what remain 

well i said there may be noth left of our special subject and 
then we shall have to take someth which is not special but of 
univ applic 

what may that be 

a someth which all art and scienc and intellig use in common 
and which everi one first ha to learn among the element of educ 

what is that 

the littl matter of distinguish one two and three in a word 
number and calcul do not all art and scienc necessarili 
partak of them 

ye 

then the art of war partak of them 

to be sure 

then palam whenev he appear in tragedi prof agamemnon 
ridicul unfit to be a gener did you never remark how he declar 
that he had invent number and had number the ship and set in array 
the rank of the armi at troy which impli that they had never been 
number befor and agamemnon must be suppo liter to have been 
incap of count hi own foot how could he if he wa ignor of 
number and if that is true what sort of gener must he have been 

i should say a veri strang one if thi wa a you say 

can we deni that a warrior should have a knowledg of arithmet 

certainli he should if he is to have the smallest understand of 
militari tactic or ind i should rather say if he is to be a man 
at all 

i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of 
thi studi 

what is your notion 

it appear to me to be a studi of the kind which we are seek and 
which lead natur to reflect but never to have been rightli 
use for the true use of it is simpli to draw the soul toward be 

will you explain your mean he said 

i will tri i said and i wish you would share the enquiri with me 
and say ye or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what 
branch of knowledg have thi attract power in order that we may 
have clearer proof that arithmet is a i suspect one of them 

explain he said 

i mean to say that object of sen are of two kind some of them do 
not invit thought becau the sen is an adequ judg of them while 
in the case of other object sen is so untrustworthi that further 
enquiri is imper demand 

you are clearli refer he said to the manner in which the sen 
are impo upon by distanc and by paint in light and shade 

no i said that is not at all my mean 

then what is your mean 

when speak of uninvit object i mean those which do not pa from 
one sensat to the opposit invit object are those which do in 
thi latter case the sen come upon the object whether at a distanc 
or near give no more vivid idea of anyth in particular than of it 
opposit an illustr will make my mean clearer here are three 
finger a littl finger a second finger and a middl finger 

veri good 

you may suppo that they are seen quit close and here come the 
point 

what is it 

each of them equal appear a finger whether seen in the middl or 
at the extrem whether white or black or thick or thin it make no 
differ a finger is a finger all the same in these case a man is 
not compel to ask of thought the question what is a finger for the 
sight never intim to the mind that a finger is other than a finger 

true 

and therefor i said a we might expect there is noth here which 
invit or excit intellig 

there is not he said 

but is thi equal true of the great and small of the finger 
can sight adequ perceiv them and is no differ made by the 
circumst that one of the finger is in the middl and anoth at 
the extrem and in like manner doe the touch adequ perceiv the 
qualiti of thick or thin of soft or hard and so of 
the other sen do they give perfect intim of such matter is 
not their mode of oper on thi wise the sen which is concern 
with the qualiti of hard is necessarili concern also with the 
qualiti of soft and onli intim to the soul that the same thing 
is felt to be both hard and soft 

you are quit right he said 

and must not the soul be perplex at thi intim which the sen 
give of a hard which is also soft what again is the mean of 
light and heavi if that which is light is also heavi and that which is 
heavi light 

ye he said these intim which the soul receiv are veri curiou 
and requir to be explain 

ye i said and in these perplex the soul natur summon to her 
aid calcul and intellig that she may see whether the sever 
object announc to her are one or two 

true 

and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and differ 

certainli 

and if each is one and both are two she will conceiv the two a in 
a state of divi for if there were undivid they could onli be 
conceiv of a one 

true 

the eye certainli did see both small and great but onli in a confu 
manner they were not distinguish 

ye 

wherea the think mind intend to light up the chao wa 
compel to rever the process and look at small and great a 
separ and not confu 

veri true 

wa not thi the begin of the enquiri what is great and what is 
small 

exactli so 

and thu aro the distinct of the visibl and the intellig 

most true 

thi wa what i meant when i spoke of impress which invit the 
intellect or the rever those which are simultan with opposit 
impress invit thought those which are not simultan do not 

i understand he said and agr with you 

and to which class do uniti and number belong 

i do not know he repli 

think a littl and you will see that what ha prece will suppli the 
answer for if simpl uniti could be adequ perceiv by the sight 
or by ani other sen then a we were say in the case of the 
finger there would be noth to attract toward be but when there 
is some contradict alway present and one is the rever of one and 
involv the concept of plural then thought begin to be arou 
within u and the soul perplex and want to arriv at a deci 
ask what is absolut uniti thi is the way in which the studi of the 
one ha a power of draw and convert the mind to the contempl 
of true be 

and sure he said thi occur notabl in the case of one for we see 
the same thing to be both one and infinit in multitud 

ye i said and thi be true of one must be equal true of all 
number 

certainli 

and all arithmet and calcul have to do with number 

ye 

and they appear to lead the mind toward truth 

ye in a veri remark manner 

then thi is knowledg of the kind for which we are seek have a 
doubl use militari and philosoph for the man of war must learn 
the art of number or he will not know how to array hi troop and the 
philosoph also becau he ha to rise out of the sea of chang and 
lay hold of true be and therefor he must be an arithmetician 

that is true 

and our guardian is both warrior and philosoph 

certainli 

then thi is a kind of knowledg which legisl may fitli prescrib 
and we must endeavour to persuad those who are to be the princip men 
of our state to go and learn arithmet not a amateur but they must 
carri on the studi until they see the natur of number with the mind 
onli nor again like merchant or retail trader with a view to buy 
or sell but for the sake of their militari use and of the soul 
herself and becau thi will be the easiest way for her to pa from 
becom to truth and be 

that is excel he said 

ye i said and now have spoken of it i must add how charm the 
scienc is and in how mani way it conduc to our desir end if 
pursu in the spirit of a philosoph and not of a shopkeep 

how do you mean 

i mean a i wa say that arithmet ha a veri great and elev 
effect compel the soul to reason about abstract number and 
rebel against the introduct of visibl or tangibl object into 
the argument you know how steadili the master of the art repel and 
ridicul ani one who attempt to divid absolut uniti when he is 
calcul and if you divid they multipli mean either 1 
that they integr the number becau they deni the possibl of 
fraction or 2 that divi is regard by them a a process of 
multipl for the fraction of one continu to be unit take 
care that one shall continu one and not becom lost in fraction 

that is veri true 

now suppo a person were to say to them o my friend what are these 
wonder number about which you are reason in which a you say 
there is a uniti such a you demand and each unit is equal invari 
indivi what would they answer 

they would answer a i should conceiv that they were speak of 
those number which can onli be realiz in thought 

then you see that thi knowledg may be truli call necessari 
necessit a it clearli doe the use of the pure intellig in the 
attain of pure truth 

ye that is a mark characterist of it 

and have you further observ that those who have a natur talent for 
calcul are gener quick at everi other kind of knowledg and 
even the dull if they have had an arithmet train although they 
may deriv no other advantag from it alway becom much quicker than 
they would otherwi have been 

veri true he said 

and ind you will not easili find a more difficult studi and not 
mani a difficult 

you will not 

and for all these reason arithmet is a kind of knowledg in which 
the best natur should be train and which must not be given up 

i agr 

let thi then be made one of our subject of educ and next shall 
we enquir whether the kindr scienc also concern u 

you mean geometri 

exactli so 

clearli he said we are concern with that part of geometri which 
relat to war for in pitch a camp or take up a posit 
or close or extend the line of an armi or ani other militari 
manoeuvr whether in actual battl or on a march it will make all the 
differ whether a gener is or is not a geometrician 

ye i said but for that purpo a veri littl of either geometri or 
calcul will be enough the question relat rather to the greater 
and more advanc part of geometri whether that tend in ani degr 
to make more easi the vision of the idea of good and thither a i wa 
say all thing tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze toward 
that place where is the full perfect of be which she ought by 
all mean to behold 

true he said 

then if geometri compel u to view be it concern u if becom 
onli it doe not concern u 

ye that is what we assert 

yet anybodi who ha the least acquaint with geometri will not deni 
that such a concept of the scienc is in flat contradict to the 
ordinari languag of geometrician 

how so 

they have in view practic onli and are alway speak in a narrow 
and ridicul manner of squar and extend and appli and the 
like they confu the necess of geometri with those of daili life 
wherea knowledg is the real object of the whole scienc 

certainli he said 

then must not a further admiss be made 

what admiss 

that the knowledg at which geometri aim is knowledg of the etern 
and not of aught perish and transient 

that he repli may be readili allow and is true 

then my nobl friend geometri will draw the soul toward truth 
and creat the spirit of philosophi and rai up that which is now 
unhappili allow to fall down 

noth will be more like to have such an effect 

then noth should be more sternli laid down than that the inhabit 
of your fair citi should by all mean learn geometri moreov the 
scienc ha indirect effect which are not small 

of what kind he said 

there are the militari advantag of which you spoke i said and in all 
depart of knowledg a experi prof ani one who ha studi 
geometri is infinit quicker of apprehen than one who ha not 

ye ind he said there is an infinit differ between them 

then shall we propo thi a a second branch of knowledg which our 
youth will studi 

let u do so he repli 

and suppo we make astronomi the third what do you say 

i am strongli inclin to it he said the observ of the season 
and of month and year is a essenti to the gener a it is to the 
farmer or sailor 

i am amu i said at your fear of the world which make you guard 
against the appear of insist upon useless studi and i quit 
admit the difficulti of believ that in everi man there is an eye 
of the soul which when by other pursuit lost and dim is by these 
purifi and re illumin and is more preciou far than ten thousand 
bodili eye for by it alon is truth seen now there are two class of 
person one class of those who will agr with you and will take 
your word a a revel anoth class to whom they will be utterli 
unmean and who will natur deem them to be idl tale for they 
see no sort of profit which is to be obtain from them and therefor 
you had better decid at onc with which of the two you are propo to 
argu you will veri like say with neither and that your chief aim in 
carri on the argument is your own improv at the same time you 
do not grudg to other ani benefit which they may receiv 

i think that i should prefer to carri on the argument mainli on my own 
behalf 

then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the 
scienc 

what wa the mistak he said 

after plane geometri i said we proceed at onc to solid in 
revolut instead of take solid in themselv wherea after the 
second dimen the third which is concern with cube and dimen 
of depth ought to have follow 

that is true socrat but so littl seem to be known a yet about 
these subject 

whi ye i said and for two reason in the first place no 
govern patroni them thi lead to a want of energi in the 
pursuit of them and they are difficult in the second place student 
cannot learn them unless they have a director but then a director 
can hardli be found and even if he could a matter now stand 
the student who are veri conceit would not attend to him that 
howev would be otherwi if the whole state becam the director of 
these studi and gave honour to them then discipl would want to 
come and there would be continu and earnest search and discoveri 
would be made sinc even now disregard a they are by the world and 
maim of their fair proport and although none of their votari 
can tell the use of them still these studi forc their way by their 
natur charm and veri like if they had the help of the state they 
would some day emerg into light 

ye he said there is a remark charm in them but i do not clearli 
understand the chang in the order first you began with a geometri of 
plane surfac 

ye i said 

and you place astronomi next and then you made a step backward 

ye and i have delay you by my hurri the ludicr state of solid 
geometri which in natur order should have follow made me pa 
over thi branch and go on to astronomi or motion of solid 

true he said 

then assum that the scienc now omit would come into exist 
if encourag by the state let u go on to astronomi which will be 
fourth 

the right order he repli and now socrat a you rebuk the 
vulgar manner in which i prai astronomi befor my prai shall 
be given in your own spirit for everi one a i think must see that 
astronomi compel the soul to look upward and lead u from thi world 
to anoth 

everi one but myself i said to everi one el thi may be clear but 
not to me 

and what then would you say 

i should rather say that those who elev astronomi into philosophi 
appear to me to make u look downward and not upward 

what do you mean he ask 

you i repli have in your mind a truli sublim concept of our 
knowledg of the thing abov and i dare say that if a person were to 
throw hi head back and studi the fret ceil you would still think 
that hi mind wa the percipi and not hi eye and you are veri 
like right and i may be a simpleton but in my opinion that 
knowledg onli which is of be and of the unseen can make the soul 
look upward and whether a man gape at the heaven or blink on the 
ground seek to learn some particular of sen i would deni that he 
can learn for noth of that sort is matter of scienc hi soul is 
look downward not upward whether hi way to knowledg is by water 
or by land whether he float or onli lie on hi back 

i acknowledg he said the justic of your rebuk still i should like 
to ascertain how astronomi can be learn in ani manner more conduc 
to that knowledg of which we are speak 

i will tell you i said the starri heaven which we behold is wrought 
upon a visibl ground and therefor although the fairest and most 
perfect of visibl thing must necessarili be deem inferior far to 
the true motion of absolut swift and absolut slow which are 
rel to each other and carri with them that which is contain in 
them in the true number and in everi true figur now these are to be 
apprehend by reason and intellig but not by sight 

true he repli 

the spangl heaven should be use a a pattern and with a view to that 
higher knowledg their beauti is like the beauti of figur or pictur 
excel wrought by the hand of daedalu or some other great artist 
which we may chanc to behold ani geometrician who saw them would 
appreci the exquisit of their workmanship but he would never 
dream of think that in them he could find the true equal or the true 
doubl or the truth of ani other proport 

no he repli such an idea would be ridicul 

and will not a true astronom have the same feel when he look at 
the movement of the star will he not think that heaven and the thing 
in heaven are frame by the creator of them in the most perfect manner 
but he will never imagin that the proport of night and day or of 
both to the month or of the month to the year or of the star to these 
and to one anoth and ani other thing that are materi and visibl 
can also be etern and subject to no deviat that would be absurd 
and it is equal absurd to take so much pain in investig their 
exact truth 

i quit agr though i never thought of thi befor 

then i said in astronomi a in geometri we should employ problem 
and let the heaven alon if we would approach the subject in the right 
way and so make the natur gift of reason to be of ani real use 

that he said is a work infinit beyond our present astronom 

ye i said and there are mani other thing which must also have a 
similar exten given to them if our legisl is to be of ani 
valu but can you tell me of ani other suitabl studi 

no he said not without think 

motion i said ha mani form and not one onli two of them are 
obviou enough even to wit no better than our and there are other 
a i imagin which may be left to wiser person 

but where are the two 

there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one alreadi 
name 

and what may that be 

the second i said would seem rel to the ear to be what the 
first is to the eye for i conceiv that a the eye are design to 
look up at the star so are the ear to hear harmoni motion and 
these are sister scienc a the pythagorean say and we glaucon 
agr with them 

ye he repli 

but thi i said is a labori studi and therefor we had better go 
and learn of them and they will tell u whether there are ani other 
applic of these scienc at the same time we must not lose sight 
of our own higher object 

what is that 

there is a perfect which all knowledg ought to reach and which our 
pupil ought also to attain and not to fall short of a i wa say 
that they did in astronomi for in the scienc of harmoni a you 
probabl know the same thing happen the teacher of harmoni compar 
the sound and conson which are heard onli and their labour like 
that of the astronom is in vain 

ye by heaven he said and ti a good a a play to hear them talk 
about their conden note a they call them they put their ear 
close alongsid of the string like person catch a sound from their 
neighbour s wall one set of them declar that they distinguish an 
intermedi note and have found the least interv which should be 
the unit of measur the other insist that the two sound have 
pa into the same either parti set their ear befor their 
understand 

you mean i said those gentleman who tea and tortur the string and 
rack them on the peg of the instrument i might carri on the metaphor 
and speak after their manner of the blow which the plectrum give 
and make accu against the string both of backward and 
forward to sound but thi would be tediou and therefor i will 
onli say that these are not the men and that i am refer to the 
pythagorean of whom i wa just now propo to enquir about harmoni 
for they too are in error like the astronom they investig the 
number of the harmoni which are heard but they never attain to 
problem that is to say they never reach the natur harmoni of 
number or reflect whi some number are harmoni and other not 

that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledg 

a thing i repli which i would rather call use that is if sought 
after with a view to the beauti and good but if pursu in ani other 
spirit useless 

veri true he said 

now when all these studi reach the point of inter communion and 
connect with one anoth and come to be consid in their mutual 
affin then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them 
have a valu for our object otherwi there is no profit in them 

i suspect so but you are speak socrat of a vast work 

what do you mean i said the prelud or what do you not know that all 
thi is but the prelud to the actual strain which we have to learn for 
you sure would not regard the skill mathematician a a dialectician 

assuredli not he said i have hardli ever known a mathematician who wa 
capabl of reason 

but do you imagin that men who are unabl to give and take a reason 
will have the knowledg which we requir of them 

neither can thi be suppo 

and so glaucon i said we have at last arriv at the hymn of 
dialect thi is that strain which is of the intellect onli but which 
the faculti of sight will nevertheless be found to imit for sight 
a you may rememb wa imagin by u after a while to behold the 
real anim and star and last of all the sun himself and so with 
dialect when a person start on the discoveri of the absolut by 
the light of reason onli and without ani assist of sen and 
persev until by pure intellig he arriv at the percept 
of the absolut good he at last find himself at the end of the 
intellectu world a in the case of sight at the end of the visibl 

exactli he said 

then thi is the progress which you call dialect 

true 

but the relea of the prison from chain and their translat 
from the shadow to the imag and to the light and the ascent from the 
underground den to the sun while in hi presenc they are vainli tri 
to look on anim and plant and the light of the sun but are abl to 
perceiv even with their weak eye the imag in the water which are 
divin and are the shadow of true exist not shadow of imag 
cast by a light of fire which compar with the sun is onli an 
imag thi power of elev the highest principl in the soul to 
the contempl of that which is best in exist with which we may 
compar the rai of that faculti which is the veri light of the bodi 
to the sight of that which is brightest in the materi and visibl 
world thi power is given a i wa say by all that studi and 
pursuit of the art which ha been describ 

i agr in what you are say he repli which may be hard to 
believ yet from anoth point of view is harder still to deni thi 
howev is not a theme to be treat of in pa onli but will have 
to be discu again and again and so whether our conclu be true 
or fal let u assum all thi and proceed at onc from the prelud 
or preambl to the chief strain a play upon the greek word which mean 
both law and strain and describ that in like manner say then 
what is the natur and what are the divi of dialect and what 
are the path which lead thither for these path will also lead to our 
final rest 

dear glaucon i said you will not be abl to follow me here though 
i would do my best and you should behold not an imag onli but the 
absolut truth accord to my notion whether what i told you would 
or would not have been a realiti i cannot ventur to say but you would 
have seen someth like realiti of that i am confid 

doubtless he repli 

but i must also remind you that the power of dialect alon can reveal 
thi and onli to one who is a discipl of the previou scienc 

of that assert you may be a confid a of the last 

and assuredli no one will argu that there is ani other method 
of comprehend by ani regular process all true exist or of 
ascertain what each thing is in it own natur for the art in 
gener are concern with the desir or opinion of men or are 
cultiv with a view to product and construct or for the 
preserv of such product and construct and a to the 
mathemat scienc which a we were say have some apprehen 
of true be geometri and the like they onli dream about be 
but never can they behold the wake realiti so long a they leav the 
hypothesi which they use unexamin and are unabl to give an account 
of them for when a man know not hi own first principl and when the 
conclu and intermedi step are also construct out of he know 
not what how can he imagin that such a fabric of convent can ever 
becom scienc 

imposs he said 

then dialect and dialect alon go directli to the first 
principl and is the onli scienc which doe away with hypothesi in 
order to make her ground secur the eye of the soul which is liter 
buri in an outlandish slough is by her gentl aid lift upward 
and she u a handmaid and helper in the work of conver the 
scienc which we have been discu custom term them scienc 
but they ought to have some other name impli greater clear 
than opinion and le clear than scienc and thi in our previou 
sketch wa call understand but whi should we disput about name 
when we have realiti of such import to consid 

whi ind he said when ani name will do which express the thought 
of the mind with clear 

at ani rate we are satisfi a befor to have four divi 
two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first divi 
scienc the second understand the third belief and the fourth 
percept of shadow opinion be concern with becom and 
intellect with be and so to make a proport 

a be is to becom so is pure intellect to opinion and a 
intellect is to opinion so is scienc to belief and understand to 
the percept of shadow 

but let u defer the further correl and subdivi of the subject 
of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiri mani time 
longer than thi ha been 

a far a i understand he said i agr 

and do you also agr i said in describ the dialectician a one who 
attain a concept of the essenc of each thing and he who doe not 
po and is therefor unabl to impart thi concept in 
whatev degr he fail may in that degr also be said to fail in 
intellig will you admit so much 

ye he said how can i deni it 

and you would say the same of the concept of the good until the 
person is abl to abstract and defin ration the idea of good 
and unless he can run the gauntlet of all object and is readi to 
disprov them not by appeal to opinion but to absolut truth never 
falter at ani step of the argument unless he can do all thi you 
would say that he know neither the idea of good nor ani other good he 
apprehend onli a shadow if anyth at all which is given by opinion 
and not by scienc dream and slumber in thi life befor he 
is well awak here he arriv at the world below and ha hi final 
quietu 

in all that i should most certainli agr with you 

and sure you would not have the child of your ideal state whom you 
are nurtur and educ if the ideal ever becom a realiti you 
would not allow the futur ruler to be like post liter line 
probabl the start point of a race cour have no reason in 
them and yet to be set in author over the highest matter 

certainli not 

then you will make a law that they shall have such an educ a 
will enabl them to attain the greatest skill in ask and answer 
question 

ye he said you and i togeth will make it 

dialect then a you will agr is the cope stone of the scienc 
and is set over them no other scienc can be place higher the natur 
of knowledg can no further go 

i agr he said 

but to whom we are to assign these studi and in what way they are to 
be assign are question which remain to be consid 

ye clearli 

you rememb i said how the ruler were chosen befor 

certainli he said 

the same natur must still be chosen and the prefer again given 
to the surest and the bravest and if possibl to the fairest and 
have nobl and gener temper they should also have the natur 
gift which will facilit their educ 

and what are these 

such gift a keen and readi power of acquisit for the mind 
more often faint from the sever of studi than from the sever of 
gymnast the toil is more entir the mind s own and is not share 
with the bodi 

veri true he repli 

further he of whom we are in search should have a good memori and be 
an unweari solid man who is a lover of labour in ani line or he will 
never be abl to endur the great amount of bodili exerci and to go 
through all the intellectu disciplin and studi which we requir of 
him 

certainli he said he must have natur gift 

the mistak at present is that those who studi philosophi have no 
vocat and thi a i wa befor say is the reason whi she ha 
fallen into disreput her true son should take her by the hand and not 
bastard 

what do you mean 

in the first place her votari should not have a lame or halt 
industri i mean that he should not be half industri and half idl 
a for exampl when a man is a lover of gymnast and hunt and all 
other bodili exerci but a hater rather than a lover of the labour 
of learn or listen or enquir or the occup to which he 
devot himself may be of an opposit kind and he may have the other 
sort of lame 

certainli he said 

and a to truth i said is not a soul equal to be deem halt and 
lame which hate voluntari falsehood and is extrem indign at 
herself and other when they tell lie but is patient of involuntari 
falsehood and doe not mind wallow like a swinish beast in the mire 
of ignor and ha no shame at be detect 

to be sure 

and again in respect of temper courag magnif and everi 
other virtu should we not care distinguish between the true son 
and the bastard for where there is no discern of such qualiti 
state and individu unconsci err and the state make a ruler 
and the individu a friend of one who be defect in some part of 
virtu is in a figur lame or a bastard 

that is veri true he said 

all these thing then will have to be care consid by u and 
if onli those whom we introduc to thi vast system of educ and 
train are sound in bodi and mind justic herself will have noth 
to say against u and we shall be the saviour of the constitut and 
of the state but if our pupil are men of anoth stamp the rever 
will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicul on 
philosophi than she ha to endur at present 

that would not be credit 

certainli not i said and yet perhap in thu turn jest into 
earnest i am equal ridicul 

in what respect 

i had forgotten i said that we were not seriou and spoke with too 
much excit for when i saw philosophi so undeservedli trampl 
under foot of men i could not help feel a sort of indign at the 
author of her disgrac and my anger made me too vehement 

ind i wa listen and did not think so 

but i who am the speaker felt that i wa and now let me remind you 
that although in our former select we chose old men we must not do 
so in thi solon wa under a delu when he said that a man when he 
grow old may learn mani thing for he can no more learn much than he 
can run much youth is the time for ani extraordinari toil 

of cour 

and therefor calcul and geometri and all the other element of 
instruct which are a prepar for dialect should be present 
to the mind in childhood not howev under ani notion of forc our 
system of educ 

whi not 

becau a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisit of 
knowledg of ani kind bodili exerci when compulsori doe no harm 
to the bodi but knowledg which is acquir under compul obtain no 
hold on the mind 

veri true 

then my good friend i said do not use compul but let earli 
educ be a sort of amu you will then be better abl to find 
out the natur bent 

that is a veri ration notion he said 

do you rememb that the child too were to be taken to see the 
battl on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be 
brought close up and like young hound have a tast of blood given 
them 

ye i rememb 

the same practic may be follow i said in all these thing labour 
lesson danger and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be 
enrol in a select number 

at what age 

at the age when the necessari gymnast are over the period whether of 
two or three year which pa in thi sort of train is useless for 
ani other purpo for sleep and exerci are unprop to learn 
and the trial of who is first in gymnast exerci is one of the most 
import test to which our youth are subject 

certainli he repli 

after that time those who are select from the class of twenti year 
old will be promot to higher honour and the scienc which they 
learn without ani order in their earli educ will now be brought 
togeth and they will be abl to see the natur relationship of them 
to one anoth and to true be 

ye he said that is the onli kind of knowledg which take last 
root 

ye i said and the capac for such knowledg is the great criterion 
of dialect talent the comprehen mind is alway the dialect 

i agr with you he said 

these i said are the point which you must consid and those who 
have most of thi comprehen and who are most steadfast in their 
learn and in their militari and other appoint duti when they 
have arriv at the age of thirti have to be chosen by you out of the 
select class and elev to higher honour and you will have to prove 
them by the help of dialect in order to learn which of them is abl 
to give up the use of sight and the other sen and in compani with 
truth to attain absolut be and here my friend great caution is 
requir 

whi great caution 

do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialect ha 
introduc 

what evil he said 

the student of the art are fill with lawless 

quit true he said 

do you think that there is anyth so veri unnatur or inexcu in 
their case or will you make allow for them 

in what way make allow 

i want you i said by way of parallel to imagin a supposit son 
who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numer 
famili and ha mani flatter when he grow up to manhood he learn 
that hi alleg are not hi real parent but who the real are he 
is unabl to discov can you guess how he will be like to behav 
toward hi flatter and hi suppo parent first of all dure the 
period when he is ignor of the fal relat and then again when he 
know or shall i guess for you 

if you plea 

then i should say that while he is ignor of the truth he will be 
like to honour hi father and hi mother and hi suppo relat 
more than the flatter he will be le inclin to neglect them when 
in need or to do or say anyth against them and he will be le 
will to disobey them in ani import matter 

he will 

but when he ha made the discoveri i should imagin that he would 
diminish hi honour and regard for them and would becom more devot 
to the flatter their influenc over him would greatli increa he 
would now live after their way and openli associ with them and 
unless he were of an unusu good disposit he would troubl 
himself no more about hi suppo parent or other relat 

well all that is veri probabl but how is the imag applic to the 
discipl of philosophi 

in thi way you know that there are certain principl about justic 
and honour which were taught u in childhood and under their parent 
author we have been brought up obey and honour them 

that is true 

there are also opposit maxim and habit of pleasur which flatter and 
attract the soul but do not influenc those of u who have ani sen of 
right and they continu to obey and honour the maxim of their father 

true 

now when a man is in thi state and the question spirit ask what 
is fair or honour and he answer a the legisl ha taught him 
and then argument mani and diver refut hi word until he is driven 
into believ that noth is honour ani more than dishonour 
or just and good ani more than the rever and so of all the notion 
which he most valu do you think that he will still honour and obey 
them a befor 

imposs 

and when he cea to think them honour and natur a heretofor 
and he fail to discov the true can he be expect to pursu ani life 
other than that which flatter hi desir 

he cannot 

and from be a keeper of the law he is convert into a breaker of it 

unquest 

now all thi is veri natur in student of philosophi such a i have 
describ and also a i wa just now say most excu 

ye he said and i may add pitiabl 

therefor that your feel may not be move to piti about our 
citizen who are now thirti year of age everi care must be taken in 
introduc them to dialect 

certainli 

there is a danger lest they should tast the dear delight too earli for 
youngster a you may have observ when they first get the tast 
in their mouth argu for amu and are alway contradict and 
refut other in imit of those who refut them like puppi dog 
they rejoic in pull and tear at all who come near them 

ye he said there is noth which they like better 

and when they have made mani conquest and receiv defeat at the hand 
of mani they violent and speedili get into a way of not believ 
anyth which they believ befor and henc not onli they but 
philosophi and all that relat to it is apt to have a bad name with the 
rest of the world 

too true he said 

but when a man begin to get older he will no longer be guilti of such 
insan he will imit the dialectician who is seek for truth and 
not the erist who is contradict for the sake of amu and the 
greater moder of hi charact will increa instead of diminish 
the honour of the pursuit 

veri true he said 

and did we not make special provi for thi when we said that the 
discipl of philosophi were to be orderli and steadfast not a now 
ani chanc aspir or intrud 

veri true 

suppo i said the studi of philosophi to take the place of gymnast 
and to be continu dilig and earnestli and exclu for twice 
the number of year which were pa in bodili exerci will that be 
enough 

would you say six or four year he ask 

say five year i repli at the end of the time they must be sent down 
again into the den and compel to hold ani militari or other offic 
which young men are qualifi to hold in thi way they will get their 
experi of life and there will be an opportun of tri whether 
when they are drawn all manner of way by temptat they will stand 
firm or flinch 

and how long is thi stage of their life to last 

fifteen year i answer and when they have reach fifti year of 
age then let those who still surviv and have distinguish themselv 
in everi action of their life and in everi branch of knowledg come at 
last to their consumm the time ha now arriv at which they must 
rai the eye of the soul to the univ light which lighten all 
thing and behold the absolut good for that is the pattern accord 
to which they are to order the state and the life of individu and 
the remaind of their own life also make philosophi their chief 
pursuit but when their turn come toil also at polit and rule 
for the public good not a though they were perform some heroic 
action but simpli a a matter of duti and when they have brought up in 
each gener other like themselv and left them in their place to 
be governor of the state then they will depart to the island of the 
blest and dwell there and the citi will give them public memori and 
sacrif and honour them if the pythian oracl consent a demigod 
but if not a in ani case bless and divin 

you are a sculptor socrat and have made statu of our governor 
faultless in beauti 

ye i said glaucon and of our gover too for you must not 
suppo that what i have been say appli to men onli and not to 
woman a far a their natur can go 

there you are right he said sinc we have made them to share in all 
thing like the men 

well i said and you would agr would you not that what ha 
been said about the state and the govern is not a mere dream and 
although difficult not imposs but onli possibl in the way which 
ha been suppo that is to say when the true philosoph king are 
born in a state one or more of them despi the honour of thi 
present world which they deem mean and worthless esteem abov all 
thing right and the honour that spring from right and regard 
justic a the greatest and most necessari of all thing whose 
minist they are and whose principl will be exalt by them when 
they set in order their own citi 

how will they proceed 

they will begin by send out into the countri all the inhabit of 
the citi who are more than ten year old and will take poss of 
their child who will be unaffect by the habit of their parent 
these they will train in their own habit and law i mean in the law 
which we have given them and in thi way the state and constitut of 
which we were speak will soonest and most easili attain happi 
and the nation which ha such a constitut will gain most 

ye that will be the best way and i think socrat that you have 
veri well describ how if ever such a constitut might come into 
be 

enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bear it 
imag there is no difficulti in see how we shall describ him 

there is no difficulti he repli and i agr with you in think 
that noth more need be said 




book viii 

and so glaucon we have arriv at the conclu that in the perfect 
state wife and child are to be in common and that all educ 
and the pursuit of war and peac are also to be common and the best 
philosoph and the bravest warrior are to be their king 

that repli glaucon ha been acknowledg 

ye i said and we have further acknowledg that the governor when 
appoint themselv will take their soldier and place them in hou 
such a we were describ which are common to all and contain noth 
privat or individu and about their properti you rememb what we 
agr 

ye i rememb that no one wa to have ani of the ordinari poss 
of mankind they were to be warrior athlet and guardian receiv 
from the other citizen in lieu of annual payment onli their 
mainten and they were to take care of themselv and of the whole 
state 

true i said and now that thi divi of our task is conclud let 
u find the point at which we digress that we may return into the old 
path 

there is no difficulti in return you impli then a now that you 
had finish the descript of the state you said that such a state 
wa good and that the man wa good who answer to it although a now 
appear you had more excel thing to relat both of state and man 
and you said further that if thi wa the true form then the other 
were fal and of the fal form you said a i rememb that there 
were four princip one and that their defect and the defect of 
the individu correspond to them were worth examin when we had 
seen all the individu and final agr a to who wa the best and 
who wa the worst of them we were to consid whether the best wa not 
also the happiest and the worst the most miser i ask you 
what were the four form of govern of which you spoke and then 
polemarchu and adeimantu put in their word and you began again and 
have found your way to the point at which we have now arriv 

your recollect i said is most exact 

then like a wrestler he repli you must put yourself again in the 
same posit and let me ask the same question and do you give me the 
same answer which you were about to give me then 

ye if i can i will i said 

i shall particularli wish to hear what were the four constitut of 
which you were speak 

that question i said is easili answer the four govern of which 
i spoke so far a they have distinct name are first those of crete 
and sparta which are gener applaud what is term oligarchi 
come next thi is not equal approv and is a form of govern 
which teem with evil thirdli democraci which natur follow 
oligarchi although veri differ and lastli come tyranni great 
and famou which differ from them all and is the fourth and worst 
disord of a state i do not know do you of ani other constitut 
which can be said to have a distinct charact there are lordship and 
princip which are bought and sold and some other intermedi 
form of govern but these are nondescript and may be found equal 
among hellen and among barbarian 

ye he repli we certainli hear of mani curiou form of govern 
which exist among them 

do you know i said that govern vari a the disposit of men 
vari and that there must be a mani of the one a there are of the 
other for we cannot suppo that state are made of oak and rock and 
not out of the human natur which are in them and which in a figur 
turn the scale and draw other thing after them 

ye he said the state are a the men are they grow out of human 
charact 

then if the constitut of state are five the disposit of 
individu mind will also be five 

certainli 

him who answer to aristocraci and whom we rightli call just and good 
we have alreadi describ 

we have 

then let u now proceed to describ the inferior sort of natur be 
the contenti and ambiti who answer to the spartan politi also 
the oligarch democrat and tyrann let u place the most 
just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be 
abl to compar the rel happi or unhappi of him who lead 
a life of pure justic or pure injust the enquiri will then be 
complet and we shall know whether we ought to pursu injust 
a thrasymachu advi or in accord with the conclu of the 
argument to prefer justic 

certainli he repli we must do a you say 

shall we follow our old plan which we adopt with a view to clear 
of take the state first and then proceed to the individu and 
begin with the govern of honour i know of no name for such a 
govern other than timocraci or perhap timarchi we will compar 
with thi the like charact in the individu and after that 
consid oligarchi and the oligarch man and then again we will turn 
our attent to democraci and the democrat man and lastli we 
will go and view the citi of tyranni and onc more take a look into the 
tyrant s soul and tri to arriv at a satisfactori deci 

that way of view and judg of the matter will be veri suitabl 

first then i said let u enquir how timocraci the govern of 
honour ari out of aristocraci the govern of the best clearli 
all polit chang origin in divi of the actual govern 
power a govern which is unit howev small cannot be move 

veri true he said 

in what way then will our citi be move and in what manner will the 
two class of auxiliari and ruler disagr among themselv or with 
one anoth shall we after the manner of homer pray the muse to tell 
u how discord first aro shall we imagin them in solemn mockeri 
to play and jest with u a if we were child and to address u in a 
lofti tragic vein make believ to be in earnest 

how would they address u 

after thi manner a citi which is thu constitut can hardli be 
shaken but see that everyth which ha a begin ha also an 
end even a constitut such a your will not last for ever but will 
in time be dissolv and thi is the dissolut in plant that grow 
in the earth a well a in anim that move on the earth s surfac 
fertil and steril of soul and bodi occur when the circumf 
of the circl of each are complet which in short live exist 
pa over a short space and in long live one over a long space but 
to the knowledg of human fecund and steril all the wisdom and 
educ of your ruler will not attain the law which regul them 
will not be discov by an intellig which is alloy with sen 
but will escap them and they will bring child into the world when 
they ought not now that which is of divin birth ha a period which is 
contain in a perfect number i e a cyclic number such a 6 which 
is equal to the sum of it divisor 1 2 3 so that when the circl 
or time repr by 6 is complet the lesser time or rotat 
repr by 1 2 3 are also complet but the period of 
human birth is comprehend in a number in which first increment 
by involut and evolut or squar and cube obtain three 
interv and four term of like and unlik wax and wane number 
make all the term commensur and agreeabl to one anoth probabl 
the number 3 4 5 6 of which the three first the side of the 
pythagorean triangl the term will then be 3 cube 4 cube 5 cube 
which togeth 6 cube 216 the base of these 3 with a third 
ad 4 when combin with five 20 and rai to the third power 
furnish two harmoni the first a squar which is a hundr time 
a great 400 4 x 100 or the first a squar which is 100 x 100 
10 000 the whole number will then be 17 500 a squar of 100 and an 
oblong of 100 by 75 and the other a figur have one side equal to 
the former but oblong consist of a hundr number squar upon 
ration diamet of a squar i e omit fraction the side of 
which is five 7 x 7 49 x 100 4900 each of them be le by one 
than the perfect squar which includ the fraction sc 50 or le 
by or consist of two number squar upon irrat diamet 
etc 100 for other explan of the passag see introduct two 
perfect squar of irrat diamet of a squar the side of which 
is five 50 50 100 and a hundr cube of three 27 x 100 2700 
4900 400 8000 now thi number repr a geometr figur 
which ha control over the good and evil of birth for when your 
guardian are ignor of the law of birth and unit bride and 
bridegroom out of season the child will not be goodli or 
fortun and though onli the best of them will be appoint by their 
predecessor still they will be unworthi to hold their father place 
and when they come into power a guardian they will soon be found 
to fail in take care of u the muse first by under valu music 
which neglect will soon extend to gymnast and henc the young men of 
your state will be le cultiv in the succeed gener ruler 
will be appoint who have lost the guardian power of test the metal 
of your differ race which like hesiod s are of gold and silver 
and brass and iron and so iron will be mingl with silver and brass 
with gold and henc there will ari dissimilar and inequ and 
irregular which alway and in all place are cau of hatr 
and war thi the muse affirm to be the stock from which discord ha 
sprung wherev ari and thi is their answer to u 

ye and we may assum that they answer truli 

whi ye i said of cour they answer truli how can the muse speak 
fal 

and what do the muse say next 

when discord aro then the two race were drawn differ way the 
iron and brass fell to acquir money and land and hou and gold and 
silver but the gold and silver race not want money but have the 
true rich in their own natur inclin toward virtu and the ancient 
order of thing there wa a battl between them and at last they 
agr to distribut their land and hou among individu owner 
and they enslav their friend and maintain whom they had formerli 
protect in the condit of freeman and made of them subject and 
servant and they themselv were engag in war and in keep a watch 
against them 

i believ that you have rightli conceiv the origin of the chang 

and the new govern which thu ari will be of a form intermedi 
between oligarchi and aristocraci 

veri true 

such will be the chang and after the chang ha been made how will 
they proceed clearli the new state be in a mean between oligarchi 
and the perfect state will partli follow one and partli the other and 
will also have some peculiar 

true he said 

in the honour given to ruler in the abstin of the warrior class 
from agricultur handicraft and trade in gener in the institut 
of common meal and in the attent paid to gymnast and militari 
train in all these respect thi state will resembl the former 

true 

but in the fear of admit philosoph to power becau they are no 
longer to be had simpl and earnest but are made up of mix element 
and in turn from them to passion and le complex charact who 
are by natur fit for war rather than peac and in the valu set 
by them upon militari stratagem and contriv and in the wage of 
everlast war thi state will be for the most part peculiar 

ye 

ye i said and men of thi stamp will be covet of money like those 
who live in oligarchi they will have a fierc secret long after 
gold and silver which they will hoard in dark place have magazin 
and treasuri of their own for the deposit and conceal of them 
also castl which are just nest for their egg and in which they will 
spend larg sum on their wife or on ani other whom they plea 

that is most true he said 

and they are miserli becau they have no mean of openli acquir the 
money which they prize they will spend that which is anoth man s on 
the gratif of their desir steal their pleasur and run 
away like child from the law their father they have been school 
not by gentl influenc but by forc for they have neglect her 
who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophi and have 
honour gymnast more than music 

undoubtedli he said the form of govern which you describ is a 
mixtur of good and evil 

whi there is a mixtur i said but one thing and one thing onli is 
predominantli seen the spirit of content and ambit and these 
are due to the preval of the passion or spirit element 

assuredli he said 

such is the origin and such the charact of thi state which ha been 
describ in outlin onli the more perfect execut wa not requir 
for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectli just and 
most perfectli unjust and to go through all the state and all the 
charact of men omit none of them would be an intermin 
labour 

veri true he repli 

now what man answer to thi form of govern how did he come into 
be and what is he like 

i think said adeimantu that in the spirit of content which 
characteri him he is not unlik our friend glaucon 

perhap i said he may be like him in that one point but there are 
other respect in which he is veri differ 

in what respect 

he should have more of self assert and be le cultiv and yet 
a friend of cultur and he should be a good listen but no speaker 
such a person is apt to be rough with slave unlik the educ man 
who is too proud for that and he will also be courteou to freeman and 
remark obedi to author he is a lover of power and a lover of 
honour claim to be a ruler not becau he is eloqu or on ani 
ground of that sort but becau he is a soldier and ha perform feat 
of arm he is also a lover of gymnast exerci and of the chase 

ye that is the type of charact which answer to timocraci 

such an one will despi rich onli when he is young but a he get 
older he will be more and more attract to them becau he ha a 
piec of the avarici natur in him and is not singl mind toward 
virtu have lost hi best guardian 

who wa that said adeimantu 

philosophi i said temper with music who come and take up her 
abod in a man and is the onli saviour of hi virtu throughout life 

good he said 

such i said is the timocrat youth and he is like the timocrat 
state 

exactli 

hi origin is a follow he is often the young son of a brave father 
who dwell in an ill govern citi of which he declin the honour 
and offic and will not go to law or exert himself in ani way but is 
readi to waiv hi right in order that he may escap troubl 

and how doe the son come into be 

the charact of the son begin to develop when he hear hi mother 
complain that her husband ha no place in the govern of which 
the consequ is that she ha no prece among other woman 
further when she see her husband not veri eager about money and 
instead of battl and rail in the law court or assembl take 
whatev happen to him quietli and when she observ that hi thought 
alway centr in himself while he treat her with veri consid 
indiff she is annoy and say to her son that hi father is 
onli half a man and far too easi go ad all the other complaint 
about her own ill treatment which woman are so fond of rehear 

ye said adeimantu they give u plenti of them and their complaint 
are so like themselv 

and you know i said that the old servant also who are suppo to 
be attach to the famili from time to time talk privat in the same 
strain to the son and if they see ani one who owe money to hi father 
or is wrong him in ani way and he fail to prosecut them they tell 
the youth that when he grow up he must retali upon peopl of thi 
sort and be more of a man than hi father he ha onli to walk abroad 
and he hear and see the same sort of thing those who do their own 
busi in the citi are call simpleton and held in no esteem while 
the busi bodi are honour and applaud the result is that the young 
man hear and see all these thing hear too the word of 
hi father and have a nearer view of hi way of life and make 
comparison of him and other is drawn opposit way while hi father 
is water and nourish the ration principl in hi soul the 
other are encourag the passion and appetit and he be not 
origin of a bad natur but have kept bad compani is at last 
brought by their joint influenc to a middl point and give up the 
kingdom which is within him to the middl principl of contenti 
and passion and becom arrog and ambiti 

you seem to me to have describ hi origin perfectli 

then we have now i said the second form of govern and the second 
type of charact 

we have 

next let u look at anoth man who a aeschylu say 

is set over against anoth state 

or rather a our plan requir begin with the state 

by all mean 

i believ that oligarchi follow next in order 

and what manner of govern do you term oligarchi 

a govern rest on a valuat of properti in which the rich have 
power and the poor man is depriv of it 

i understand he repli 

ought i not to begin by describ how the chang from timocraci to 
oligarchi ari 

ye 

well i said no eye are requir in order to see how the one pa 
into the other 

how 

the accumul of gold in the treasuri of privat individu is the 
ruin of timocraci they invent illeg mode of expenditur for what do 
they or their wife care about the law 

ye ind 

and then one see anoth grow rich seek to rival him and thu the 
great mass of the citizen becom lover of money 

like enough 

and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of make 
a fortun the le they think of virtu for when rich and virtu are 
place togeth in the scale of the balanc the one alway rise a 
the other fall 

true 

and in proport a rich and rich men are honour in the state 
virtu and the virtuou are dishonour 

clearli 

and what is honour is cultiv and that which ha no honour is 
neglect 

that is obviou 

and so at last instead of love content and glori men becom 
lover of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and 
make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man 

they do so 

they next proceed to make a law which fix a sum of money a the 
qualif of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower 
in anoth a the oligarchi is more or le exclu and they allow 
no one whose properti fall below the amount fix to have ani share in 
the govern these chang in the constitut they effect by forc 
of arm if intimid ha not alreadi done their work 

veri true 

and thi speak gener is the way in which oligarchi is 
establish 

ye he said but what are the characterist of thi form of 
govern and what are the defect of which we were speak 

first of all i said consid the natur of the qualif just 
think what would happen if pilot were to be chosen accord to their 
properti and a poor man were refu permiss to steer even though 
he were a better pilot 

you mean that they would shipwreck 

ye and is not thi true of the govern of anyth 

i should imagin so 

except a citi or would you includ a citi 

nay he said the case of a citi is the strongest of all inasmuch a 
the rule of a citi is the greatest and most difficult of all 

thi then will be the first great defect of oligarchi 

clearli 

and here is anoth defect which is quit a bad 

what defect 

the inevit divi such a state is not one but two state the 
one of poor the other of rich men and they are live on the same spot 
and alway conspir against one anoth 

that sure is at least a bad 

anoth discredit featur is that for a like reason they are 
incap of carri on ani war either they arm the multitud and 
then they are more afraid of them than of the enemi or if they do not 
call them out in the hour of battl they are oligarch ind few to 
fight a they are few to rule and at the same time their fond for 
money make them unwil to pay tax 

how discredit 

and a we said befor under such a constitut the same person have 
too mani call they are husbandman tradesman warrior all in one 
doe that look well 

anyth but well 

there is anoth evil which is perhap the greatest of all and to 
which thi state first begin to be liabl 

what evil 

a man may sell all that he ha and anoth may acquir hi properti 
yet after the sale he may dwell in the citi of which he is no longer a 
part be neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplit but 
onli a poor helpless creatur 

ye that is an evil which also first begin in thi state 

the evil is certainli not prevent there for oligarchi have both the 
extrem of great wealth and utter poverti 

true 

but think again in hi wealthi day while he wa spend hi money 
wa a man of thi sort a whit more good to the state for the purpo 
of citizenship or did he onli seem to be a member of the rule 
bodi although in truth he wa neither ruler nor subject but just a 
spendthrift 

a you say he seem to be a ruler but wa onli a spendthrift 

may we not say that thi is the drone in the hou who is like the drone 
in the honeycomb and that the one is the plagu of the citi a the 
other is of the hive 

just so socrat 

and god ha made the fli drone adeimantu all without sting 
wherea of the walk drone he ha made some without sting but other 
have dread sting of the stingless class are those who in their old 
age end a pauper of the stinger come all the crimin class a they 
are term 

most true he said 

clearli then whenev you see pauper in a state somewh in that 
neighborhood there are hidden away thief and cut pur and robber 
of templ and all sort of malefactor 

clearli 

well i said and in oligarch state do you not find pauper 

ye he said nearli everybodi is a pauper who is not a ruler 

and may we be so bold a to affirm that there are also mani crimin to 
be found in them rogu who have sting and whom the author are 
care to restrain by forc 

certainli we may be so bold 

the exist of such person is to be attribut to want of educ 
ill train and an evil constitut of the state 

true 

such then is the form and such are the evil of oligarchi and there 
may be mani other evil 

veri like 

then oligarchi or the form of govern in which the ruler are 
elect for their wealth may now be dismiss let u next proceed to 
consid the natur and origin of the individu who answer to thi 
state 

by all mean 

doe not the timocrat man chang into the oligarch on thi wise 

how 

a time arriv when the repr of timocraci ha a son at first 
he begin by emul hi father and walk in hi footstep but 
present he see him of a sudden founder against the state a upon 
a sunken reef and he and all that he ha is lost he may have been 
a gener or some other high offic who is brought to trial under a 
prejud rai by inform and either put to death or exil or 
depriv of the privileg of a citizen and all hi properti taken from 
him 

noth more like 

and the son ha seen and known all thi he is a ruin man and hi 
fear ha taught him to knock ambit and passion headforemost from hi 
bosom s throne humbl by poverti he take to money make and by mean 
and miserli save and hard work get a fortun togeth is not such 
an one like to seat the concupisc and covet element on the 
vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt 
with tiara and chain and scimitar 

most true he repli 

and when he ha made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obedi 
on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place 
he compel the one to think onli of how lesser sum may be turn into 
larger one and will not allow the other to worship and admir anyth 
but rich and rich men or to be ambiti of anyth so much a the 
acquisit of wealth and the mean of acquir it 

of all chang he said there is none so speedi or so sure a the 
conver of the ambiti youth into the avarici one 

and the avarici i said is the oligarch youth 

ye he said at ani rate the individu out of whom he came is like the 
state out of which oligarchi came 

let u then consid whether there is ani like between them 

veri good 

first then they resembl one anoth in the valu which they set upon 
wealth 

certainli 

also in their penuri labori charact the individu onli 
satisfi hi necessari appetit and confin hi expenditur to them 
hi other desir he subdu under the idea that they are unprofit 

true 

he is a shabbi fellow who save someth out of everyth and make a 
pur for himself and thi is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud 
is he not a true imag of the state which he repr 

he appear to me to be so at ani rate money is highli valu by him a 
well a by the state 

you see that he is not a man of cultiv i said 

i imagin not he said had he been educ he would never have made a 
blind god director of hi choru or given him chief honour 

excel i said yet consid must we not further admit that owe to 
thi want of cultiv there will be found in him dronelik desir a 
of pauper and rogu which are forcibl kept down by hi gener habit 
of life 

true 

do you know where you will have to look if you want to discov hi 
rogueri 

where must i look 

you should see him where he ha some great opportun of act 
dishonestli a in the guardianship of an orphan 

aye 

it will be clear enough then that in hi ordinari deal which give 
him a reput for honesti he coerc hi bad passion by an enforc 
virtu not make them see that they are wrong or tame them by 
reason but by necess and fear constrain them and becau he 
trembl for hi poss 

to be sure 

ye ind my dear friend but you will find that the natur desir 
of the drone commonli exist in him all the same whenev he ha to spend 
what is not hi own 

ye and they will be strong in him too 

the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not 
one but in gener hi better desir will be found to prevail over 
hi inferior one 

true 

for these reason such an one will be more respect than most peopl 
yet the true virtu of a unanim and harmoni soul will flee far 
away and never come near him 

i should expect so 

and sure the miser individu will be an ignobl competitor in a 
state for ani prize of victori or other object of honour ambit 
he will not spend hi money in the contest for glori so afraid is he of 
awaken hi expen appetit and invit them to help and join in 
the struggl in true oligarch fashion he fight with a small part 
onli of hi resourc and the result commonli is that he lose the 
prize and save hi money 

veri true 

can we ani longer doubt then that the miser and money maker answer to 
the oligarch state 

there can be no doubt 

next come democraci of thi the origin and natur have still to 
be consid by u and then we will enquir into the way of the 
democrat man and bring him up for judgment 

that he said is our method 

well i said and how doe the chang from oligarchi into democraci 
ari is it not on thi wise the good at which such a state aim is 
to becom a rich a possibl a desir which is insati 

what then 

the ruler be awar that their power rest upon their wealth refu 
to curtail by law the extravag of the spendthrift youth becau 
they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their 
estat and thu increa their own wealth and import 

to be sure 

there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of 
moder cannot exist togeth in citizen of the same state to ani 
consid extent one or the other will be disregard 

that is toler clear 

and in oligarch state from the gener spread of careless and 
extravag men of good famili have often been reduc to beggari 

ye often 

and still they remain in the citi there they are readi to sting and 
fulli arm and some of them owe money some have forfeit their 
citizenship a third class are in both predica and they hate 
and conspir against those who have got their properti and against 
everybodi el and are eager for revolut 

that is true 

on the other hand the men of busi stoop a they walk and 
pretend not even to see those whom they have alreadi ruin insert 
their sting that is their money into some one el who is not on 
hi guard against them and recov the parent sum mani time over 
multipli into a famili of child and so they make drone and pauper 
to abound in the state 

ye he said there are plenti of them that is certain 

the evil blaze up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either 
by restrict a man s use of hi own properti or by anoth remedi 

what other 

one which is the next best and ha the advantag of compel the 
citizen to look to their charact let there be a gener rule that 
everi one shall enter into voluntari contract at hi own risk and 
there will be le of thi scandal money make and the evil of 
which we were speak will be greatli lessen in the state 

ye they will be greatli lessen 

at present the governor induc by the motif which i have name 
treat their subject badli while they and their adher especi 
the young men of the govern class are habitu to lead a life 
of luxuri and idl both of bodi and mind they do noth and are 
incap of resist either pleasur or pain 

veri true 

they themselv care onli for make money and are a indiff a 
the pauper to the cultiv of virtu 

ye quit a indiff 

such is the state of affair which prevail among them and often ruler 
and their subject may come in one anoth s way whether on a journey 
or on some other occa of meet on a pilgrimag or a march 
a fellow soldier or fellow sailor aye and they may observ the 
behaviour of each other in the veri moment of danger for where danger 
is there is no fear that the poor will be despi by the rich and 
veri like the wiri sunburnt poor man may be place in battl at the 
side of a wealthi one who ha never spoilt hi complexion and ha 
plenti of superflu flesh when he see such an one puf and at hi 
wit end how can he avoid draw the conclu that men like him are 
onli rich becau no one ha the courag to despoil them and when they 
meet in privat will not peopl be say to one anoth our warrior 
are not good for much 

ye he said i am quit awar that thi is their way of talk 

and a in a bodi which is disea the addit of a touch from without 
may bring on ill and sometim even when there is no extern 
provoc a commot may ari within in the same way wherev there 
is weak in the state there is also like to be ill of which 
the occa may be veri slight the one parti introduc from without 
their oligarch the other their democrat alli and then 
the state fall sick and is at war with herself and may be at time 
distract even when there is no extern cau 

ye sure 

and then democraci come into be after the poor have conquer their 
oppon slaughter some and banish some while to the remaind 
they give an equal share of freedom and power and thi is the form of 
govern in which the magistr are commonli elect by lot 

ye he said that is the natur of democraci whether the revolut 
ha been effect by arm or whether fear ha cau the opposit parti 
to withdraw 

and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a govern have 
they for a the govern is such will be the man 

clearli he said 

in the first place are they not free and is not the citi full of 
freedom and frank a man may say and do what he like 

ti said so he repli 

and where freedom is the individu is clearli abl to order for 
himself hi own life a he plea 

clearli 

then in thi kind of state there will be the greatest varieti of human 
natur 

there will 

thi then seem like to be the fairest of state be like an 
embroid robe which is spangl with everi sort of flower and just 
a woman and child think a varieti of colour to be of all thing 
most charm so there are mani men to whom thi state which is 
spangl with the manner and charact of mankind will appear to be 
the fairest of state 

ye 

ye my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a 
govern 

whi 

becau of the liberti which reign there they have a complet 
assort of constitut and he who ha a mind to establish a state 
a we have been do must go to a democraci a he would to a bazaar at 
which they sell them and pick out the one that suit him then when he 
ha made hi choic he may found hi state 

he will be sure to have pattern enough 

and there be no necess i said for you to govern in thi state 
even if you have the capac or to be govern unless you like or 
go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peac when other are 
at peac unless you are so dispo there be no necess also 
becau some law forbid you to hold offic or be a dicast that you 
should not hold offic or be a dicast if you have a fanci is not thi 
a way of life which for the moment is suprem delight 

for the moment ye 

and is not their human to the condemn in some case quit charm 
have you not observ how in a democraci mani person although they 
have been sentenc to death or exil just stay where they are and walk 
about the world the gentleman parad like a hero and nobodi see or 
care 

ye he repli mani and mani a one 

see too i said the forgiv spirit of democraci and the don t 
care about trifl and the disregard which she show of all the fine 
principl which we solemnli laid down at the foundat of the citi a 
when we said that except in the case of some rare gift natur 
there never will be a good man who ha not from hi childhood been use 
to play amid thing of beauti and make of them a joy and a studi how 
grandli doe she trampl all these fine notion of our under her foot 
never give a thought to the pursuit which make a statesman and 
promot to honour ani one who profess to be the peopl s friend 

ye she is of a nobl spirit 

these and other kindr characterist are proper to democraci which 
is a charm form of govern full of varieti and disord and 
dispen a sort of equal to equal and unequ alik 

we know her well 

consid now i said what manner of man the individu is or rather 
consid a in the case of the state how he come into be 

veri good he said 

is not thi the way he is the son of the miserli and oligarch 
father who ha train him in hi own habit 

exactli 

and like hi father he keep under by forc the pleasur which are of 
the spend and not of the get sort be those which are call 
unnecessari 

obviou 

would you like for the sake of clear to distinguish which are the 
necessari and which are the unnecessari pleasur 

i should 

are not necessari pleasur those of which we cannot get rid and of 
which the satisfact is a benefit to u and they are rightli call 
so becau we are frame by natur to desir both what is benefici 
and what is necessari and cannot help it 

true 

we are not wrong therefor in call them necessari 

we are not 

and the desir of which a man may get rid if he take pain from hi 
youth upward of which the presenc moreov doe no good and in 
some case the rever of good shall we not be right in say that all 
these are unnecessari 

ye certainli 

suppo we select an exampl of either kind in order that we may have a 
gener notion of them 

veri good 

will not the desir of eat that is of simpl food and condiment 
in so far a they are requir for health and strength be of the 
necessari class 

that is what i should suppo 

the pleasur of eat is necessari in two way it doe u good and it 
is essenti to the continu of life 

ye 

but the condiment are onli necessari in so far a they are good for 
health 

certainli 

and the desir which go beyond thi of more delic food or other 
luxuri which might gener be got rid of if control and train 
in youth and is hurt to the bodi and hurt to the soul in the 
pursuit of wisdom and virtu may be rightli call unnecessari 

veri true 

may we not say that these desir spend and that the other make money 
becau they conduc to product 

certainli 

and of the pleasur of love and all other pleasur the same hold 
good 

true 

and the drone of whom we spoke wa he who wa surfeit in pleasur 
and desir of thi sort and wa the slave of the unnecessari desir 
wherea he who wa subject to the necessari onli wa miserli and 
oligarch 

veri true 

again let u see how the democrat man grow out of the 
oligarch the follow a i suspect is commonli the process 

what is the process 

when a young man who ha been brought up a we were just now describ 
in a vulgar and miserli way ha tast drone honey and ha come to 
associ with fierc and crafti natur who are abl to provid for 
him all sort of refin and varieti of pleasur then a you may 
imagin the chang will begin of the oligarch principl within him 
into the democrat 

inevit 

and a in the citi like wa help like and the chang wa effect by 
an allianc from without assist one divi of the citizen so too 
the young man is chang by a class of desir come from without 
to assist the desir within him that which is akin and alik again 
help that which is akin and alik 

certainli 

and if there be ani alli which aid the oligarch principl within 
him whether the influenc of a father or of kindr advi or 
rebuk him then there ari in hi soul a faction and an opposit 
faction and he go to war with himself 

it must be so 

and there are time when the democrat principl give way to the 
oligarch and some of hi desir die and other are banish 
a spirit of rever enter into the young man s soul and order is 
restor 

ye he said that sometim happen 

and then again after the old desir have been driven out fresh one 
spring up which are akin to them and becau he their father doe not 
know how to educ them wax fierc and numer 

ye he said that is apt to be the way 

they draw him to hi old associ and hold secret intercour with 
them breed and multipli in him 

veri true 

at length they seiz upon the citadel of the young man s soul which 
they perceiv to be void of all accomplish and fair pursuit and 
true word which make their abod in the mind of men who are dear to 
the god and are their best guardian and sentinel 

none better 

fal and boast conceit and phrase mount upward and take their 
place 

they are certain to do so 

and so the young man return into the countri of the lotu eater and 
take up hi dwell there in the face of all men and if ani help be 
sent by hi friend to the oligarch part of him the aforesaid vain 
conceit shut the gate of the king s fast and they will neither 
allow the embassi itself to enter nor if privat advi offer the 
fatherli counsel of the age will they listen to them or receiv them 
there is a battl and they gain the day and then modesti which 
they call silli is ignomini thrust into exil by them and 
temper which they nicknam unmanli is trampl in the mire and 
cast forth they persuad men that moder and orderli expenditur 
are vulgar and mean and so by the help of a rabbl of evil 
appetit they drive them beyond the border 

ye with a will 

and when they have empti and swept clean the soul of him who is now in 
their power and who is be initi by them in great mysteri the 
next thing is to bring back to their hou insol and anarchi and 
wast and impud in bright array have garland on their head and 
a great compani with them hymn their prai and call them by 
sweet name insol they term breed and anarchi liberti and 
wast magnif and impud courag and so the young man 
pa out of hi origin natur which wa train in the school of 
necess into the freedom and libertin of useless and unnecessari 
pleasur 

ye he said the chang in him is visibl enough 

after thi he life on spend hi money and labour and time on 
unnecessari pleasur quit a much a on necessari one but if he be 
fortun and is not too much disord in hi wit when year have 
elap and the heyday of passion is over suppo that he then 
re admit into the citi some part of the exil virtu and doe not 
wholli give himself up to their successor in that case he balanc hi 
pleasur and life in a sort of equilibrium put the govern of 
himself into the hand of the one which come first and win the turn 
and when he ha had enough of that then into the hand of anoth he 
despi none of them but encourag them all equal 

veri true he said 

neither doe he receiv or let pa into the fortress ani true word of 
advic if ani one say to him that some pleasur are the satisfact 
of good and nobl desir and other of evil desir and that he ought 
to use and honour some and chasti and master the other whenev thi 
is repeat to him he shake hi head and say that they are all alik 
and that one is a good a anoth 

ye he said that is the way with him 

ye i said he life from day to day indulg the appetit of the 
hour and sometim he is lap in drink and strain of the flute then 
he becom a water drinker and tri to get thin then he take a turn 
at gymnast sometim idl and neglect everyth then onc 
more live the life of a philosoph often he is busi with polit 
and start to hi foot and say and doe whatev come into hi head 
and if he is emul of ani one who is a warrior off he is in that 
direct or of men of busi onc more in that hi life ha 
neither law nor order and thi distract exist he term joy and 
bliss and freedom and so he go on 

ye he repli he is all liberti and equal 

ye i said hi life is motley and manifold and an epitom of the 
life of mani he answer to the state which we describ a fair 
and spangl and mani a man and mani a woman will take him for their 
pattern and mani a constitut and mani an exampl of manner is 
contain in him 

just so 

let him then be set over against democraci he may truli be call the 
democrat man 

let that be hi place he said 

last of all come the most beauti of all man and state alik 
tyranni and the tyrant these we have now to consid 

quit true he said 

say then my friend in what manner doe tyranni ari that it ha a 
democrat origin is evid 

clearli 

and doe not tyranni spring from democraci in the same manner a 
democraci from oligarchi i mean after a sort 

how 

the good which oligarchi propo to itself and the mean by which it 
wa maintain wa excess of wealth am i not right 

ye 

and the insati desir of wealth and the neglect of all other thing 
for the sake of money get wa also the ruin of oligarchi 

true 

and democraci ha her own good of which the insati desir bring 
her to dissolut 

what good 

freedom i repli which a they tell you in a democraci is the glori 
of the state and that therefor in a democraci alon will the freeman 
of natur deign to dwell 

ye the say is in everi bodi s mouth 

i wa go to observ that the insati desir of thi and the 
neglect of other thing introduc the chang in democraci which 
occa a demand for tyranni 

how so 

when a democraci which is thirst for freedom ha evil cup bearer 
presid over the feast and ha drunk too deepli of the strong wine of 
freedom then unless her ruler are veri amen and give a plenti 
draught she call them to account and punish them and say that they 
are cur oligarch 

ye he repli a veri common occurr 

ye i said and loyal citizen are insultingli term by her slave who 
hug their chain and men of naught she would have subject who are like 
ruler and ruler who are like subject these are men after her own 
heart whom she prai and honour both in privat and public now in 
such a state can liberti have ani limit 

certainli not 

by degr the anarchi find a way into privat hou and end by 
get among the anim and infect them 

how do you mean 

i mean that the father grow accustom to descend to the level of hi 
son and to fear them and the son is on a level with hi father he 
have no respect or rever for either of hi parent and thi is 
hi freedom and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen 
with the metic and the stranger is quit a good a either 

ye he said that is the way 

and these are not the onli evil i said there are sever lesser one 
in such a state of societi the master fear and flatter hi scholar 
and the scholar despi their master and tutor young and old are 
all alik and the young man is on a level with the old and is readi 
to compet with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the 
young and are full of pleasantri and gaieti they are loth to be thought 
moro and authorit and therefor they adopt the manner of the 
young 

quit true he said 

the last extrem of popular liberti is when the slave bought with money 
whether male or femal is just a free a hi or her purcha nor 
must i forget to tell of the liberti and equal of the two sex in 
relat to each other 

whi not a aeschylu say utter the word which rise to our lip 

that is what i am do i repli and i must add that no one who 
doe not know would believ how much greater is the liberti which the 
anim who are under the dominion of man have in a democraci than in 
ani other state for truli the she dog a the proverb say are a 
good a their she mistress and the hor and as have a way of 
march along with all the right and digniti of freeman and they 
will run at ani bodi who come in their way if he doe not leav 
the road clear for them and all thing are just readi to burst with 
liberti 

when i take a countri walk he said i often experi what you 
describ you and i have dream the same thing 

and abov all i said and a the result of all see how sensit the 
citizen becom they chafe impati at the least touch of author 
and at length a you know they cea to care even for the law 
written or unwritten they will have no one over them 

ye he said i know it too well 

such my friend i said is the fair and gloriou begin out of which 
spring tyranni 

gloriou ind he said but what is the next step 

the ruin of oligarchi is the ruin of democraci the same disea 
magnifi and intensifi by liberti overmast democraci the truth 
be that the excess increa of anyth often cau a reaction in 
the opposit direct and thi is the case not onli in the season and 
in veget and anim life but abov all in form of govern 

true 

the excess of liberti whether in state or individu seem onli to 
pa into excess of slaveri 

ye the natur order 

and so tyranni natur ari out of democraci and the most 
aggrav form of tyranni and slaveri out of the most extrem form of 
liberti 

a we might expect 

that howev wa not a i believ your question you rather desir 
to know what is that disord which is gener alik in oligarchi and 
democraci and is the ruin of both 

just so he repli 

well i said i meant to refer to the class of idl spendthrift 
of whom the more courag are the leader and the more timid the 
follow the same whom we were compar to drone some stingless 
and other have sting 

a veri just comparison 

these two class are the plagu of everi citi in which they are 
gener be what phlegm and bile are to the bodi and the good 
physician and lawgiv of the state ought like the wise bee master to 
keep them at a distanc and prevent if possibl their ever come in 
and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and 
their cell cut out a speedili a possibl 

ye by all mean he said 

then in order that we may see clearli what we are do let u imagin 
democraci to be divid a ind it is into three class for in the 
first place freedom creat rather more drone in the democrat than 
there were in the oligarch state 

that is true 

and in the democraci they are certainli more intensifi 

how so 

becau in the oligarch state they are disqualifi and driven from 
offic and therefor they cannot train or gather strength wherea in a 
democraci they are almost the entir rule power and while the keener 
sort speak and act the rest keep buzz about the bema and do not 
suffer a word to be said on the other side henc in democraci almost 
everyth is manag by the drone 

veri true he said 

then there is anoth class which is alway be sever from the mass 

what is that 

they are the orderli class which in a nation of trader is sure to be 
the richest 

natur so 

they are the most squeezabl person and yield the largest amount of 
honey to the drone 

whi he said there is littl to be squeez out of peopl who have 
littl 

and thi is call the wealthi class and the drone feed upon them 

that is pretti much the case he said 

the peopl are a third class consist of those who work with their 
own hand they are not politician and have not much to live upon 
thi when assembl is the largest and most power class in a 
democraci 

true he said but then the multitud is seldom will to congreg 
unless they get a littl honey 

and do they not share i said do not their leader depriv the rich 
of their estat and distribut them among the peopl at the same time 
take care to reserv the larger part for themselv 

whi ye he said to that extent the peopl do share 

and the person whose properti is taken from them are compel to 
defend themselv befor the peopl a they best can 

what el can they do 

and then although they may have no desir of chang the other charg 
them with plot against the peopl and be friend of oligarchi 

true 

and the end is that when they see the peopl not of their own accord 
but through ignor and becau they are deceiv by inform 
seek to do them wrong then at last they are forc to becom 
oligarch in realiti they do not wish to be but the sting of the 
drone torment them and breed revolut in them 

that is exactli the truth 

then come impeach and judgment and trial of one anoth 

true 

the peopl have alway some champion whom they set over them and nur 
into great 

ye that is their way 

thi and no other is the root from which a tyrant spring when he first 
appear abov ground he is a protector 

ye that is quit clear 

how then doe a protector begin to chang into a tyrant clearli when 
he doe what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian templ of 
lycaean zeu 

what tale 

the tale is that he who ha tast the entrail of a singl human victim 
minc up with the entrail of other victim is destin to becom a 
wolf did you never hear it 

oh ye 

and the protector of the peopl is like him have a mob entir at 
hi dispo he is not restrain from shed the blood of kinsman 
by the favourit method of fal accu he bring them into court 
and murder them make the life of man to disappear and with unholi 
tongu and lip tast the blood of hi fellow citizen some he kill 
and other he banish at the same time hint at the abolit of 
debt and partit of land and after thi what will be hi destini 
must he not either perish at the hand of hi enemi or from be a 
man becom a wolf that is a tyrant 

inevit 

thi i said is he who begin to make a parti against the rich 

the same 

after a while he is driven out but come back in spite of hi enemi 
a tyrant full grown 

that is clear 

and if they are unabl to expel him or to get him condemn to death by 
a public accu they conspir to assassin him 

ye he said that is their usual way 

then come the famou request for a bodi guard which is the devic of 
all those who have got thu far in their tyrann career let not the 
peopl s friend a they say be lost to them 

exactli 

the peopl readili assent all their fear are for him they have none 
for themselv 

veri true 

and when a man who is wealthi and is also accu of be an enemi of 
the peopl see thi then my friend a the oracl said to croesu 

by pebbl hermu shore he flee and rest not and is not asham to 
be a coward 

and quit right too said he for if he were he would never be asham 
again 

but if he is caught he dy 

of cour 

and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not lard the 
plain with hi bulk but himself the overthrow of mani stand up 
in the chariot of state with the rein in hi hand no longer protector 
but tyrant absolut 

no doubt he said 

and now let u consid the happi of the man and also of the state 
in which a creatur like him is gener 

ye he said let u consid that 

at first in the earli day of hi power he is full of smile and 
he salut everi one whom he meet he to be call a tyrant who is 
make promi in public and also in privat liber debtor and 
distribut land to the peopl and hi follow and want to be so 
kind and good to everi one 

of cour he said 

but when he ha dispo of foreign enemi by conquest or treati and 
there is noth to fear from them then he is alway stir up some 
war or other in order that the peopl may requir a leader 

to be sure 

ha he not also anoth object which is that they may be impoverish 
by payment of tax and thu compel to devot themselv to their 
daili want and therefor le like to conspir against him 

clearli 

and if ani of them are suspect by him of have notion of freedom 
and of resist to hi author he will have a good pretext for 
destroy them by place them at the merci of the enemi and for all 
these reason the tyrant must be alway get up a war 

he must 

now he begin to grow unpopular 

a necessari result 

then some of those who join in set him up and who are in power 
speak their mind to him and to one anoth and the more courag of 
them cast in hi teeth what is be done 

ye that may be expect 

and the tyrant if he mean to rule must get rid of them he cannot 
stop while he ha a friend or an enemi who is good for anyth 

he cannot 

and therefor he must look about him and see who is valiant who is 
high mind who is wise who is wealthi happi man he is the enemi 
of them all and must seek occa against them whether he will or no 
until he ha made a purgat of the state 

ye he said and a rare purgat 

ye i said not the sort of purgat which the physician make of the 
bodi for they take away the wor and leav the better part but he 
doe the rever 

if he is to rule i suppo that he cannot help himself 

what a bless altern i said to be compel to dwell onli with 
the mani bad and to be by them hate or not to live at all 

ye that is the altern 

and the more detest hi action are to the citizen the more 
satellit and the greater devot in them will he requir 

certainli 

and who are the devot band and where will he procur them 

they will flock to him he said of their own accord if he pay them 

by the dog i said here are more drone of everi sort and from everi 
land 

ye he said there are 

but will he not desir to get them on the spot 

how do you mean 

he will rob the citizen of their slave he will then set them free and 
enrol them in hi bodi guard 

to be sure he said and he will be abl to trust them best of all 

what a bless creatur i said must thi tyrant be he ha put to 
death the other and ha these for hi trust friend 

ye he said they are quit of hi sort 

ye i said and these are the new citizen whom he ha call into 
exist who admir him and are hi companion while the good hate 
and avoid him 

of cour 

verili then tragedi is a wise thing and euripid a great tragedian 

whi so 

whi becau he is the author of the pregnant say 

tyrant are wise by live with the wise 

and he clearli meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant make 
hi companion 

ye he said and he also prai tyranni a godlik and mani other 
thing of the same kind are said by him and by the other poet 

and therefor i said the tragic poet be wise men will forgiv u 
and ani other who live after our manner if we do not receiv them into 
our state becau they are the eulogist of tyranni 

ye he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgiv u 

but they will continu to go to other citi and attract mob and 
hire voic fair and loud and persua and draw the citi over to 
tyranni and democraci 

veri true 

moreov they are paid for thi and receiv honour the greatest 
honour a might be expect from tyrant and the next greatest from 
democraci but the higher they ascend our constitut hill the more 
their reput fail and seem unabl from short of breath to 
proceed further 

true 

but we are wander from the subject let u therefor return and 
enquir how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numer and variou 
and ever chang armi of hi 

if he said there are sacr treasur in the citi he will confisc 
and spend them and in so far a the fortun of attaint person may 
suffic he will be abl to diminish the tax which he would otherwi 
have to impo upon the peopl 

and when these fail 

whi clearli he said then he and hi boon companion whether male or 
femal will be maintain out of hi father s estat 

you mean to say that the peopl from whom he ha deriv hi be 
will maintain him and hi companion 

ye he said they cannot help themselv 

but what if the peopl fli into a passion and aver that a grown up son 
ought not to be support by hi father but that the father should be 
support by the son the father did not bring him into be or settl 
him in life in order that when hi son becam a man he should himself 
be the servant of hi own servant and should support him and hi rabbl 
of slave and companion but that hi son should protect him and that 
by hi help he might be emancip from the govern of the rich and 
aristocrat a they are term and so he bid him and hi companion 
depart just a ani other father might drive out of the hou a riotou 
son and hi undesir associ 

by heaven he said then the parent will discov what a monster he ha 
been foster in hi bosom and when he want to drive him out he 
will find that he is weak and hi son strong 

whi you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violenc what 
beat hi father if he oppo him 

ye he will have first disarm him 

then he is a parricid and a cruel guardian of an age parent and thi 
is real tyranni about which there can be no longer a mistak a the 
say is the peopl who would escap the smoke which is the slaveri of 
freeman ha fallen into the fire which is the tyranni of slave thu 
liberti get out of all order and reason pa into the harshest 
and bitterest form of slaveri 

true he said 

veri well and may we not rightli say that we have suffici 
discu the natur of tyranni and the manner of the transit from 
democraci to tyranni 

ye quit enough he said 




book ix 

last of all come the tyrann man about whom we have onc more to 
ask how is he form out of the democrat and how doe he live in 
happi or in miseri 

ye he said he is the onli one remain 

there is howev i said a previou question which remain unansw 

what question 

i do not think that we have adequ determin the natur and number 
of the appetit and until thi is accomplish the enquiri will alway 
be confu 

well he said it is not too late to suppli the omiss 

veri true i said and observ the point which i want to understand 
certain of the unnecessari pleasur and appetit i conceiv to be 
unlaw everi one appear to have them but in some person they are 
control by the law and by reason and the better desir prevail 
over them either they are wholli banish or they becom few and weak 
while in the case of other they are stronger and there are more of 
them 

which appetit do you mean 

i mean those which are awak when the reason and human and rule 
power is asleep then the wild beast within u gorg with meat or 
drink start up and have shaken off sleep go forth to satisfi 
hi desir and there is no conceiv folli or crime not except 
incest or ani other unnatur union or parricid or the eat of 
forbidden food which at such a time when he ha part compani with 
all shame and sen a man may not be readi to commit 

most true he said 

but when a man s pul is healthi and temper and when befor go 
to sleep he ha awaken hi ration power and fed them on nobl 
thought and enquiri collect himself in medit after have 
first indulg hi appetit neither too much nor too littl but just 
enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoy and 
pain from interf with the higher principl which he leaf in 
the solitud of pure abstract free to contempl and aspir to 
the knowledg of the unknown whether in past present or futur when 
again he ha allay the passion element if he ha a quarrel against 
ani one i say when after pacifi the two irrat principl he 
rou up the third which is reason befor he take hi rest then 
a you know he attain truth most nearli and is least like to be the 
sport of fantast and lawless vision 

i quit agr 

in say thi i have been run into a digress but the point 
which i desir to note is that in all of u even in good men there is 
a lawless wild beast natur which peer out in sleep pray consid 
whether i am right and you agr with me 

ye i agr 

and now rememb the charact which we attribut to the democrat 
man he wa suppo from hi youth upward to have been train under 
a miserli parent who encourag the save appetit in him but 
discountenanc the unnecessari which aim onli at amu and 
ornament 

true 

and then he got into the compani of a more refin licenti sort of 
peopl and take to all their wanton way rush into the opposit 
extrem from an abhorr of hi father s mean at last be a 
better man than hi corruptor he wa drawn in both direct until he 
halt midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but 
of what he deem moder indulg in variou pleasur after thi 
manner the democrat wa gener out of the oligarch 

ye he said that wa our view of him and is so still 

and now i said year will have pa away and you must conceiv thi 
man such a he is to have a son who is brought up in hi father s 
principl 

i can imagin him 

then you must further imagin the same thing to happen to the son 
which ha alreadi happen to the father he is drawn into a perfectli 
lawless life which by hi seduc is term perfect liberti and hi 
father and friend take part with hi moder desir and the opposit 
parti assist the opposit one a soon a these dire magician and 
tyrant maker find that they are lose their hold on him they contriv 
to implant in him a master passion to be lord over hi idl and 
spendthrift lust a sort of monstrou wing drone that is the onli 
imag which will adequ describ him 

ye he said that is the onli adequ imag of him 

and when hi other lust amid cloud of incen and perfum and 
garland and wine and all the pleasur of a dissolut life now let 
loo come buzz around him nourish to the utmost the sting of 
desir which they implant in hi drone like natur then at last thi 
lord of the soul have mad for the captain of hi guard break 
out into a frenzi and if he find in himself ani good opinion or 
appetit in process of format and there is in him ani sen of 
shame remain to these better principl he put an end and cast 
them forth until he ha purg away temper and brought in mad to 
the full 

ye he said that is the way in which the tyrann man is gener 

and is not thi the reason whi of old love ha been call a tyrant 

i should not wonder 

further i said ha not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant 

he ha 

and you know that a man who is derang and not right in hi mind will 
fanci that he is abl to rule not onli over men but also over the 
god 

that he will 

and the tyrann man in the true sen of the word come into be 
when either under the influenc of natur or habit or both he 
becom drunken lust passion o my friend is not that so 

assuredli 

such is the man and such is hi origin and next how doe he live 

suppo a peopl faceti say you were to tell me 

i imagin i said at the next step in hi progress that there will be 
feast and carou and revel and courtezan and all that sort 
of thing love is the lord of the hou within him and order all the 
concern of hi soul 

that is certain 

ye and everi day and everi night desir grow up mani and formid 
and their demand are mani 

they are ind he said 

hi revenu if he ha ani are soon spent 

true 

then come debt and the cut down of hi properti 

of cour 

when he ha noth left must not hi desir crowd in the nest 
like young raven be cri aloud for food and he goad on by them 
and especi by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them 
is in a frenzi and would fain discov whom he can defraud or despoil 
of hi properti in order that he may gratifi them 

ye that is sure to be the case 

he must have money no matter how if he is to escap horrid pain and 
pang 

he must 

and a in himself there wa a success of pleasur and the new got 
the better of the old and took away their right so he be younger 
will claim to have more than hi father and hi mother and if he ha 
spent hi own share of the properti he will take a slice of their 

no doubt he will 

and if hi parent will not give way then he will tri first of all to 
cheat and deceiv them 

veri true 

and if he fail then he will use forc and plunder them 

ye probabl 

and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend 
will the creatur feel ani compunct at tyrann over them 

nay he said i should not feel at all comfort about hi parent 

but o heaven adeimantu on account of some new fangl love of a 
harlot who is anyth but a necessari connect can you believ that 
he would strike the mother who is hi ancient friend and necessari 
to hi veri exist and would place her under the author of the 
other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under 
like circumst he would do the same to hi wither old father 
first and most indispen of friend for the sake of some 
newli found bloom youth who is the rever of indispen 

ye ind he said i believ that he would 

truli then i said a tyrann son is a bless to hi father and 
mother 

he is ind he repli 

he first take their properti and when that fail and pleasur are 
begin to swarm in the hive of hi soul then he break into a hou 
or steal the garment of some nightli wayfar next he proce to 
clear a templ meanwhil the old opinion which he had when a child 
and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those 
other which have just been emancip and are now the bodi guard of 
love and share hi empir these in hi democrat day when he wa 
still subject to the law and to hi father were onli let loo in 
the dream of sleep but now that he is under the dominion of love he 
becom alway and in wake realiti what he wa then veri rare and in 
a dream onli he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food 
or be guilti of ani other horrid act love is hi tyrant and life 
lordli in him and lawlessli and be himself a king lead him on a 
a tyrant lead a state to the perform of ani reckless deed by which 
he can maintain himself and the rabbl of hi associ whether those 
whom evil commun have brought in from without or those whom 
he himself ha allow to break loo within him by reason of a similar 
evil natur in himself have we not here a pictur of hi way of life 

ye ind he said 

and if there are onli a few of them in the state and the rest of the 
peopl are well dispo they go away and becom the bodi guard or 
mercenari soldier of some other tyrant who may probabl want them for a 
war and if there is no war they stay at home and do mani littl piec 
of mischief in the citi 

what sort of mischief 

for exampl they are the thief burglar cut pur foot pad 
robber of templ man stealer of the commun or if they are abl 
to speak they turn inform and bear fal wit and take bribe 

a small catalogu of evil even if the perpetr of them are few in 
number 

ye i said but small and great are compar term and all these 
thing in the miseri and evil which they inflict upon a state do not 
come within a thousand mile of the tyrant when thi noxiou class and 
their follow grow numer and becom consciou of their strength 
assist by the infatu of the peopl they choo from among 
themselv the one who ha most of the tyrant in hi own soul and him 
they creat their tyrant 

ye he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant 

if the peopl yield well and good but if they resist him a he began 
by beat hi own father and mother so now if he ha the power he 
beat them and will keep hi dear old fatherland or motherland a the 
cretan say in subject to hi young retain whom he ha introduc 
to be their ruler and master thi is the end of hi passion and 
desir 

exactli 

when such men are onli privat individu and befor they get power 
thi is their charact they associ entir with their own 
flatter or readi tool or if they want anyth from anybodi they 
in their turn are equal readi to bow down befor them they profess 
everi sort of affect for them but when they have gain their point 
they know them no more 

ye truli 

they are alway either the master or servant and never the friend of 
anybodi the tyrant never tast of true freedom or friendship 

certainli not 

and may we not rightli call such men treacher 

no question 

also they are utterli unjust if we were right in our notion of justic 

ye he said and we were perfectli right 

let u then sum up in a word i said the charact of the worst man he 
is the wake realiti of what we dream 

most true 

and thi is he who be by natur most of a tyrant bear rule and the 
longer he life the more of a tyrant he becom 

that is certain said glaucon take hi turn to answer 

and will not he who ha been shown to be the wickedest be also the most 
miser and he who ha tyrann longest and most most continu 
and truli miser although thi may not be the opinion of men in 
gener 

ye he said inevit 

and must not the tyrann man be like the tyrann state and 
the democrat man like the democrat state and the same of the 
other 

certainli 

and a state is to state in virtu and happi so is man in relat 
to man 

to be sure 

then compar our origin citi which wa under a king and the citi 
which is under a tyrant how do they stand a to virtu 

they are the opposit extrem he said for one is the veri best and 
the other is the veri worst 

there can be no mistak i said a to which is which and therefor 
i will at onc enquir whether you would arriv at a similar deci 
about their rel happi and miseri and here we must not allow 
ourselv to be panic stricken at the apparit of the tyrant who is 
onli a unit and may perhap have a few retain about him but let u 
go a we ought into everi corner of the citi and look all about and 
then we will give our opinion 

a fair invit he repli and i see a everi one must that a 
tyranni is the wretchedest form of govern and the rule of a king 
the happiest 

and in estim the men too may i not fairli make a like request 
that i should have a judg whose mind can enter into and see through 
human natur he must not be like a child who look at the outsid and 
is dazzl at the pompou aspect which the tyrann natur assum to 
the behold but let him be one who ha a clear insight may i suppo 
that the judgment is given in the hear of u all by one who is abl 
to judg and ha dwelt in the same place with him and been present at 
hi dalli life and known him in hi famili relat where he may be 
seen strip of hi tragedi attir and again in the hour of public 
danger he shall tell u about the happi and miseri of the tyrant 
when compar with other men 

that again he said is a veri fair propo 

shall i assum that we ourselv are abl and experienc judg and 
have befor now met with such a person we shall then have some one who 
will answer our enquiri 

by all mean 

let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individu and the 
state bear thi in mind and glanc in turn from one to the other 
of them will you tell me their respect condit 

what do you mean he ask 

begin with the state i repli would you say that a citi which is 
govern by a tyrant is free or enslav 

no citi he said can be more complet enslav 

and yet a you see there are freeman a well a master in such a 
state 

ye he said i see that there are a few but the peopl speak 
gener and the best of them are miser degrad and enslav 

then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule 
prevail hi soul is full of mean and vulgar the best element 
in him are enslav and there is a small rule part which is also the 
worst and maddest 

inevit 

and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman 
or of a slave 

he ha the soul of a slave in my opinion 

and the state which is enslav under a tyrant is utterli incap of 
act voluntarili 

utterli incap 

and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speak of the soul 
taken a a whole is least capabl of do what she desir there is a 
gadfli which goad her and she is full of troubl and remor 

certainli 

and is the citi which is under a tyrant rich or poor 

poor 

and the tyrann soul must be alway poor and insati 

true 

and must not such a state and such a man be alway full of fear 

ye ind 

is there ani state in which you will find more of lament and sorrow 
and groan and pain 

certainli not 

and is there ani man in whom you will find more of thi sort of miseri 
than in the tyrann man who is in a furi of passion and desir 

imposs 

reflect upon these and similar evil you held the tyrann state 
to be the most miser of state 

and i wa right he said 

certainli i said and when you see the same evil in the tyrann 
man what do you say of him 

i say that he is by far the most miser of all men 

there i said i think that you are begin to go wrong 

what do you mean 

i do not think that he ha a yet reach the utmost extrem of miseri 

then who is more miser 

one of whom i am about to speak 

who is that 

he who is of a tyrann natur and instead of lead a privat life 
ha been cur with the further misfortun of be a public tyrant 

from what ha been said i gather that you are right 

ye i repli but in thi high argument you should be a littl more 
certain and should not conjectur onli for of all question thi 
respect good and evil is the greatest 

veri true he said 

let me then offer you an illustr which may i think throw a light 
upon thi subject 

what is your illustr 

the case of rich individu in citi who po mani slave from 
them you may form an idea of the tyrant s condit for they both have 
slave the onli differ is that he ha more slave 

ye that is the differ 

you know that they live secur and have noth to apprehend from 
their servant 

what should they fear 

noth but do you observ the reason of thi 

ye the reason is that the whole citi is leagu togeth for the 
protect of each individu 

veri true i said but imagin one of these owner the master say of 
some fifti slave togeth with hi famili and properti and slave 
carri off by a god into the wilder where there are no freeman to 
help him will he not be in an agoni of fear lest he and hi wife and 
child should be put to death by hi slave 

ye he said he will be in the utmost fear 

the time ha arriv when he will be compel to flatter diver of hi 
slave and make mani promi to them of freedom and other thing much 
against hi will he will have to cajol hi own servant 

ye he said that will be the onli way of save himself 

and suppo the same god who carri him away to surround him with 
neighbour who will not suffer one man to be the master of anoth and 
who if they could catch the offend would take hi life 

hi case will be still wor if you suppo him to be everywh 
surround and watch by enemi 

and is not thi the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he 
who be by natur such a we have describ is full of all sort of 
fear and lust hi soul is dainti and greedi and yet alon of all 
men in the citi he is never allow to go on a journey or to see the 
thing which other freeman desir to see but he life in hi hole like 
a woman hidden in the hou and is jealou of ani other citizen who 
go into foreign part and see anyth of interest 

veri true he said 

and amid evil such a these will not he who is ill govern in hi own 
person the tyrann man i mean whom you just now decid to be the 
most miser of all will not he be yet more miser when instead 
of lead a privat life he is constrain by fortun to be a public 
tyrant he ha to be master of other when he is not master of himself 
he is like a disea or paralyt man who is compel to pa hi 
life not in retir but fight and combat with other men 

ye he said the similitud is most exact 

is not hi case utterli miser and doe not the actual tyrant lead a 
wor life than he whose life you determin to be the worst 

certainli 

he who is the real tyrant whatev men may think is the real slave 
and is oblig to practi the greatest adul and servil and to 
be the flatter of the vilest of mankind he ha desir which he is 
utterli unabl to satisfi and ha more want than ani one and is truli 
poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all hi life 
long he is beset with fear and is full of convul and distract 
even a the state which he resembl and sure the resembl hold 

veri true he said 

moreov a we were say befor he grow wor from have power he 
becom and is of necess more jealou more faithless more unjust 
more friendless more impiou than he wa at first he is the purveyor 
and cherish of everi sort of vice and the consequ is that he is 
suprem miser and that he make everybodi el a miser a 
himself 

no man of ani sen will disput your word 

come then i said and a the gener umpir in theatric contest 
proclaim the result do you also decid who in your opinion is first 
in the scale of happi and who second and in what order the other 
follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocrat 
oligarch democrat tyrann 

the deci will be easili given he repli they shall be choru 
come on the stage and i must judg them in the order in which they 
enter by the criterion of virtu and vice happi and miseri 

need we hire a herald or shall i announc that the son of ariston the 
best ha decid that the best and justest is also the happiest and 
that thi is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and 
that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miser and that 
thi is he who be the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest 
tyrant of hi state 

make the proclam yourself he said 

and shall i add whether seen or unseen by god and men 

let the word be ad 

then thi i said will be our first proof and there is anoth which 
may also have some weight 

what is that 

the second proof is deriv from the natur of the soul see that 
the individu soul like the state ha been divid by u into three 
principl the divi may i think furnish a new demonstr 

of what natur 

it seem to me that to these three principl three pleasur 
correspond also three desir and govern power 

how do you mean he said 

there is one principl with which a we were say a man learn 
anoth with which he is angri the third have mani form ha no 
special name but is denot by the gener term appetit from 
the extraordinari strength and vehem of the desir of eat and 
drink and the other sensual appetit which are the main element of 
it also money love becau such desir are gener satisfi by 
the help of money 

that is true he said 

if we were to say that the love and pleasur of thi third part were 
concern with gain we should then be abl to fall back on a singl 
notion and might truli and intellig describ thi part of the soul 
a love gain or money 

i agr with you 

again is not the passion element wholli set on rule and conquer 
and get fame 

true 

suppo we call it the contenti or ambiti would the term be 
suitabl 

extrem suitabl 

on the other hand everi one see that the principl of knowledg is 
wholli direct to the truth and care le than either of the other 
for gain or fame 

far le 

lover of wisdom lover of knowledg are titl which we may fitli 
appli to that part of the soul 

certainli 

one principl prevail in the soul of one class of men anoth in 
other a may happen 

ye 

then we may begin by assum that there are three class of 
men lover of wisdom lover of honour lover of gain 

exactli 

and there are three kind of pleasur which are their sever object 

veri true 

now if you examin the three class of men and ask of them in turn 
which of their life is pleasantest each will be found prai hi 
own and depreci that of other the money maker will contrast the 
vaniti of honour or of learn if they bring no money with the solid 
advantag of gold and silver 

true he said 

and the lover of honour what will be hi opinion will he not think 
that the pleasur of rich is vulgar while the pleasur of learn 
if it bring no distinct is all smoke and nonsen to him 

veri true 

and are we to suppo i said that the philosoph set ani valu on 
other pleasur in comparison with the pleasur of know the truth 
and in that pursuit abid ever learn not so far ind from the 
heaven of pleasur doe he not call the other pleasur necessari 
under the idea that if there were no necess for them he would rather 
not have them 

there can be no doubt of that he repli 

sinc then the pleasur of each class and the life of each are in 
disput and the question is not which life is more or le honour 
or better or wor but which is the more pleasant or painless how 
shall we know who speak truli 

i cannot myself tell he said 

well but what ought to be the criterion is ani better than experi 
and wisdom and reason 

there cannot be a better he said 

then i said reflect of the three individu which ha the greatest 
experi of all the pleasur which we enum ha the lover of 
gain in learn the natur of essenti truth greater experi of 
the pleasur of knowledg than the philosoph ha of the pleasur of 
gain 

the philosoph he repli ha greatli the advantag for he ha 
of necess alway known the tast of the other pleasur from hi 
childhood upward but the lover of gain in all hi experi ha not 
of necess tast or i should rather say even had he desir could 
hardli have tast the sweet of learn and know truth 

then the lover of wisdom ha a great advantag over the lover of gain 
for he ha a doubl experi 

ye veri great 

again ha he greater experi of the pleasur of honour or the 
lover of honour of the pleasur of wisdom 

nay he said all three are honour in proport a they attain their 
object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alik have 
their crowd of admir and a they all receiv honour they all have 
experi of the pleasur of honour but the delight which is to be 
found in the knowledg of true be is known to the philosoph onli 

hi experi then will enabl him to judg better than ani one 

far better 

and he is the onli one who ha wisdom a well a experi 

certainli 

further the veri faculti which is the instrument of judgment is not 
poss by the covet or ambiti man but onli by the philosoph 

what faculti 

reason with whom a we were say the deci ought to rest 

ye 

and reason is peculiarli hi instrument 

certainli 

if wealth and gain were the criterion then the prai or blame of the 
lover of gain would sure be the most trustworthi 

assuredli 

or if honour or victori or courag in that case the judgment of the 
ambiti or pugnaci would be the truest 

clearli 

but sinc experi and wisdom and reason are the judg 

the onli infer possibl he repli is that pleasur which are 
approv by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest 

and so we arriv at the result that the pleasur of the intellig 
part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of u in 
whom thi is the rule principl ha the pleasantest life 

unquest he said the wise man speak with author when he 
approv of hi own life 

and what doe the judg affirm to be the life which is next and the 
pleasur which is next 

clearli that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to 
himself than the money maker 

last come the lover of gain 

veri true he said 

twice in success then ha the just man overthrown the unjust in 
thi conflict and now come the third trial which is dedic to 
olympian zeu the saviour a sage whisper in my ear that no pleasur 
except that of the wise is quit true and pure all other are a shadow 
onli and sure thi will prove the greatest and most deci of 
fall 

ye the greatest but will you explain yourself 

i will work out the subject and you shall answer my question 

proceed 

say then is not pleasur oppo to pain 

true 

and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasur nor pain 

there is 

a state which is intermedi and a sort of repo of the soul about 
either that is what you mean 

ye 

you rememb what peopl say when they are sick 

what do they say 

that after all noth is pleasant than health but then they never 
knew thi to be the greatest of pleasur until they were ill 

ye i know he said 

and when person are suffer from acut pain you must have heard them 
say that there is noth pleasant than to get rid of their pain 

i have 

and there are mani other case of suffer in which the mere rest and 
cessat of pain and not ani posit enjoy is extol by them 
a the greatest pleasur 

ye he said at the time they are plea and well content to be at 
rest 

again when pleasur cea that sort of rest or cessat will be 
pain 

doubtless he said 

then the intermedi state of rest will be pleasur and will also be 
pain 

so it would seem 

but can that which is neither becom both 

i should say not 

and both pleasur and pain are motion of the soul are they not 

ye 

but that which is neither wa just now shown to be rest and not motion 
and in a mean between them 

ye 

how then can we be right in suppo that the absenc of pain is 
pleasur or that the absenc of pleasur is pain 

imposs 

thi then is an appear onli and not a realiti that is to say the 
rest is pleasur at the moment and in comparison of what is pain 
and pain in comparison of what is pleasant but all these 
repres when tri by the test of true pleasur are not real 
but a sort of imposit 

that is the infer 

look at the other class of pleasur which have no antec pain and 
you will no longer suppo a you perhap may at present that pleasur 
is onli the cessat of pain or pain of pleasur 

what are they he said and where shall i find them 

there are mani of them take a an exampl the pleasur of smell which 
are veri great and have no antec pain they come in a moment and 
when they depart leav no pain behind them 

most true he said 

let u not then be induc to believ that pure pleasur is the 
cessat of pain or pain of pleasur 

no 

still the more numer and violent pleasur which reach the soul 
through the bodi are gener of thi sort they are relief of pain 

that is true 

and the anticip of futur pleasur and pain are of a like 
natur 

ye 

shall i give you an illustr of them 

let me hear 

you would allow i said that there is in natur an upper and lower and 
middl region 

i should 

and if a person were to go from the lower to the middl region would 
he not imagin that he is go up and he who is stand in the middl 
and see whenc he ha come would imagin that he is alreadi in the 
upper region if he ha never seen the true upper world 

to be sure he said how can he think otherwi 

but if he were taken back again he would imagin and truli imagin 
that he wa descend 

no doubt 

all that would ari out of hi ignor of the true upper and middl 
and lower region 

ye 

then can you wonder that person who are inexperienc in the truth a 
they have wrong idea about mani other thing should also have wrong 
idea about pleasur and pain and the intermedi state so that when 
they are onli be drawn toward the pain they feel pain and think 
the pain which they experi to be real and in like manner when 
drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermedi state they firmli 
believ that they have reach the goal of satieti and pleasur they 
not know pleasur err in contrast pain with the absenc of pain 
which is like contrast black with grey instead of white can you 
wonder i say at thi 

no ind i should be much more dispo to wonder at the opposit 

look at the matter thu hunger thirst and the like are inanit 
of the bodili state 

ye 

and ignor and folli are inanit of the soul 

true 

and food and wisdom are the correspond satisfact of either 

certainli 

and is the satisfact deriv from that which ha le or from that 
which ha more exist the truer 

clearli from that which ha more 

what class of thing have a greater share of pure exist in your 
judgment those of which food and drink and condiment and all kind of 
susten are exampl or the class which contain true opinion 
and knowledg and mind and all the differ kind of virtu put 
the question in thi way which ha a more pure be that which is 
concern with the invari the immort and the true and is of 
such a natur and is found in such natur or that which is concern 
with and found in the variabl and mortal and is itself variabl and 
mortal 

far purer he repli is the be of that which is concern with the 
invari 

and doe the essenc of the invari partak of knowledg in the same 
degr a of essenc 

ye of knowledg in the same degr 

and of truth in the same degr 

ye 

and conver that which ha le of truth will also have le of 
essenc 

necessarili 

then in gener those kind of thing which are in the servic of the 
bodi have le of truth and essenc than those which are in the servic 
of the soul 

far le 

and ha not the bodi itself le of truth and essenc than the soul 

ye 

what is fill with more real exist and actual ha a more real 
exist is more realli fill than that which is fill with le 
real exist and is le real 

of cour 

and if there be a pleasur in be fill with that which is accord 
to natur that which is more realli fill with more real be 
will more realli and truli enjoy true pleasur wherea that which 
particip in le real be will be le truli and sure satisfi 
and will particip in an illusori and le real pleasur 

unquest 

those then who know not wisdom and virtu and are alway busi with 
gluttoni and sensual go down and up again a far a the mean and 
in thi region they move at random throughout life but they never pa 
into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever 
find their way neither are they truli fill with true be nor do 
they tast of pure and abid pleasur like cattl with their eye 
alway look down and their head stoop to the earth that is 
to the dine tabl they fatten and feed and breed and in their 
excess love of these delight they kick and butt at one anoth with 
horn and hoof which are made of iron and they kill one anoth by 
reason of their insati lust for they fill themselv with that 
which is not substanti and the part of themselv which they fill is 
also unsubstanti and incontin 

verili socrat said glaucon you describ the life of the mani like 
an oracl 

their pleasur are mix with pain how can they be otherwi for 
they are mere shadow and pictur of the true and are colour by 
contrast which exagg both light and shade and so they implant 
in the mind of fool insan desir of themselv and they are fought 
about a stesichoru say that the greek fought about the shadow of 
helen at troy in ignor of the truth 

someth of that sort must inevit happen 

and must not the like happen with the spirit or passion element 
of the soul will not the passion man who carri hi passion into 
action be in the like case whether he is enviou and ambiti or 
violent and contenti or angri and discont if he be seek 
to attain honour and victori and the satisfact of hi anger without 
reason or sen 

ye he said the same will happen with the spirit element also 

then may we not confid assert that the lover of money and honour 
when they seek their pleasur under the guidanc and in the compani 
of reason and knowledg and pursu after and win the pleasur which 
wisdom show them will also have the truest pleasur in the highest 
degr which is attain to them inasmuch a they follow truth and 
they will have the pleasur which are natur to them if that which is 
best for each one is also most natur to him 

ye certainli the best is the most natur 

and when the whole soul follow the philosoph principl and there 
is no divi the sever part are just and do each of them their 
own busi and enjoy sever the best and truest pleasur of which 
they are capabl 

exactli 

but when either of the two other principl prevail it fail in 
attain it own pleasur and compel the rest to pursu after a 
pleasur which is a shadow onli and which is not their own 

true 

and the greater the interv which separ them from philosophi and 
reason the more strang and illu will be the pleasur 

ye 

and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distanc 
from law and order 

clearli 

and the lust and tyrann desir are a we saw at the greatest 
distanc ye 

and the royal and orderli desir are nearest 

ye 

then the tyrant will live at the greatest distanc from true or natur 
pleasur and the king at the least 

certainli 

but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantli and the king most 
pleasantli 

inevit 

would you know the measur of the interv which separ them 

will you tell me 

there appear to be three pleasur one genuin and two spuriou now 
the transgress of the tyrant reach a point beyond the spuriou he 
ha run away from the region of law and reason and taken up hi abod 
with certain slave pleasur which are hi satellit and the measur 
of hi inferior can onli be express in a figur 

how do you mean 

i assum i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the 
oligarch the democrat wa in the middl 

ye 

and if there is truth in what ha prece he will be wed to an 
imag of pleasur which is thrice remov a to truth from the pleasur 
of the oligarch 

he will 

and the oligarch is third from the royal sinc we count a one royal 
and aristocrat 

ye he is third 

then the tyrant is remov from true pleasur by the space of a number 
which is three time three 

manifestli 

the shadow then of tyrann pleasur determin by the number of 
length will be a plane figur 

certainli 

and if you rai the power and make the plane a solid there is no 
difficulti in see how vast is the interv by which the tyrant is 
part from the king 

ye the arithmetician will easili do the sum 

or if some person begin at the other end and measur the interv by 
which the king is part from the tyrant in truth of pleasur he will 
find him when the multipl is complet live 729 time more 
pleasantli and the tyrant more pain by thi same interv 

what a wonder calcul and how enorm is the distanc which 
separ the just from the unjust in regard to pleasur and pain 

yet a true calcul i said and a number which nearli concern human 
life if human be are concern with day and night and month and 
year 729 nearli equal the number of day and night in the year 

ye he said human life is certainli concern with them 

then if the good and just man be thu superior in pleasur to the evil 
and unjust hi superior will be infinit greater in proprieti of 
life and in beauti and virtu 

immeasur greater 

well i said and now have arriv at thi stage of the argument we 
may revert to the word which brought u hither wa not some one say 
that injust wa a gain to the perfectli unjust who wa reput to be 
just 

ye that wa said 

now then have determin the power and qualiti of justic and 
injust let u have a littl conver with him 

what shall we say to him 

let u make an imag of the soul that he may have hi own word 
present befor hi eye 

of what sort 

an ideal imag of the soul like the composit creation of ancient 
mytholog such a the chimera or scylla or cerberu and there are mani 
other in which two or more differ natur are said to grow into one 

there are said of have been such union 

then do you now model the form of a multitudin mani head monster 
have a ring of head of all manner of beast tame and wild which he 
is abl to gener and metamorpho at will 

you suppo marvel power in the artist but a languag is more 
pliabl than wax or ani similar substanc let there be such a model a 
you propo 

suppo now that you make a second form a of a lion and a third of a 
man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the 
second 

that he said is an easier task and i have made them a you say 

and now join them and let the three grow into one 

that ha been accomplish 

next fashion the outsid of them into a singl imag a of a man so 
that he who is not abl to look within and see onli the outer hull 
may believ the beast to be a singl human creatur 

i have done so he said 

and now to him who maintain that it is profit for the human 
creatur to be unjust and unprofit to be just let u repli 
that if he be right it is profit for thi creatur to feast 
the multitudin monster and strengthen the lion and the lion like 
qualiti but to starv and weaken the man who is consequ liabl 
to be drag about at the merci of either of the other two and he is 
not to attempt to familiar or harmon them with one anoth he 
ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one anoth 

certainli he said that is what the approv of injust say 

to him the support of justic make answer that he should ever so 
speak and act a to give the man within him in some way or other the 
most complet masteri over the entir human creatur he should watch 
over the mani head monster like a good husbandman foster and 
cultiv the gentl qualiti and prevent the wild one from 
grow he should be make the lion heart hi alli and in common care 
of them all should be unit the sever part with one anoth and 
with himself 

ye he said that is quit what the maintain of justic say 

and so from everi point of view whether of pleasur honour or 
advantag the approv of justic is right and speak the truth and 
the disapprov is wrong and fal and ignor 

ye from everi point of view 

come now and let u gentli reason with the unjust who is not 
intent in error sweet sir we will say to him what think 
you of thing esteem nobl and ignobl is not the nobl that which 
subject the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the 
ignobl that which subject the man to the beast he can hardli avoid 
say ye can he now 

not if he ha ani regard for my opinion 

but if he agr so far we may ask him to answer anoth question 
then how would a man profit if he receiv gold and silver on the 
condit that he wa to enslav the noblest part of him to the worst 
who can imagin that a man who sold hi son or daughter into slaveri for 
money especi if he sold them into the hand of fierc and evil men 
would be the gainer howev larg might be the sum which he 
receiv and will ani one say that he is not a miser caitiff who 
remorselessli sell hi own divin be to that which is most godless 
and detest eriphyl took the necklac a the price of her husband s 
life but he is take a bribe in order to compass a wor ruin 

ye said glaucon far wor i will answer for him 

ha not the intemp been censur of old becau in him the huge 
multiform monster is allow to be too much at larg 

clearli 

and men are blame for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent 
element in them disproport grow and gain strength 

ye 

and luxuri and soft are blame becau they relax and weaken thi 
same creatur and make a coward of him 

veri true 

and is not a man reproach for flatteri and mean who subordin 
the spirit anim to the unruli monster and for the sake of money 
of which he can never have enough habitu him in the day of hi 
youth to be trampl in the mire and from be a lion to becom a 
monkey 

true he said 

and whi are mean employ and manual art a reproach onli becau 
they impli a natur weak of the higher principl the individu is 
unabl to control the creatur within him but ha to court them and 
hi great studi is how to flatter them 

such appear to be the reason 

and therefor be desir of place him under a rule like that of 
the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom 
the divin rule not a thrasymachu suppo to the injuri of the 
servant but becau everi one had better be rule by divin wisdom 
dwell within him or if thi be imposs then by an extern 
author in order that we may be all a far a possibl under the 
same govern friend and equal 

true he said 

and thi is clearli seen to be the intent of the law which is the 
alli of the whole citi and is seen also in the author which we 
exerci over child and the refu to let them be free until we 
have establish in them a principl analog to the constitut of 
a state and by cultiv of thi higher element have set up in their 
heart a guardian and ruler like our own and when thi is done they may 
go their way 

ye he said the purpo of the law is manifest 

from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man 
is profit by injust or intemp or other base which will 
make him a wor man even though he acquir money or power by hi 
wick 

from no point of view at all 

what shall he profit if hi injust be undetect and unpunish 
he who is undetect onli get wor wherea he who is detect and 
punish ha the brutal part of hi natur silenc and human the 
gentler element in him is liber and hi whole soul is perfect and 
ennobl by the acquir of justic and temper and wisdom more 
than the bodi ever is by receiv gift of beauti strength and health 
in proport a the soul is more honour than the bodi 

certainli he said 

to thi nobler purpo the man of understand will devot the energi 
of hi life and in the first place he will honour studi which 
impress these qualiti on hi soul and will disregard other 

clearli he said 

in the next place he will regul hi bodili habit and train and 
so far will he be from yield to brutal and irrat pleasur that 
he will regard even health a quit a secondari matter hi first object 
will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is like 
therebi to gain temper but he will alway desir so to attemp the 
bodi a to preserv the harmoni of the soul 

certainli he will if he ha true music in him 

and in the acquisit of wealth there is a principl of order and 
harmoni which he will also observ he will not allow himself to be 
dazzl by the foolish applau of the world and heap up rich to hi 
own infinit harm 

certainli not he said 

he will look at the citi which is within him and take heed that no 
disord occur in it such a might ari either from superflu or 
from want and upon thi principl he will regul hi properti and 
gain or spend accord to hi mean 

veri true 

and for the same reason he will gladli accept and enjoy such honour 
a he deem like to make him a better man but those whether privat 
or public which are like to disord hi life he will avoid 

then if that is hi motiv he will not be a statesman 

by the dog of egypt he will in the citi which is hi own he certainli 
will though in the land of hi birth perhap not unless he have a 
divin call 

i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the citi of which we 
are the founder and which exist in idea onli for i do not believ 
that there is such an one anywh on earth 

in heaven i repli there is laid up a pattern of it methink which 
he who desir may behold and behold may set hi own hou in 
order but whether such an one exist or ever will exist in fact is no 
matter for he will live after the manner of that citi have noth 
to do with ani other 

i think so he said 




book x 

of the mani excel which i perceiv in the order of our state 
there is none which upon reflect plea me better than the rule 
about poetri 

to what do you refer 

to the reject of imit poetri which certainli ought not to be 
receiv a i see far more clearli now that the part of the soul have 
been distinguish 

what do you mean 

speak in confid for i should not like to have my word repeat 
to the tragedian and the rest of the imit tribe but i do not 
mind say to you that all poetic imit are ruinou to the 
understand of the hearer and that the knowledg of their true 
natur is the onli antidot to them 

explain the purport of your remark 

well i will tell you although i have alway from my earliest youth had 
an awe and love of homer which even now make the word falter on 
my lip for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that 
charm tragic compani but a man is not to be reverenc more than the 
truth and therefor i will speak out 

veri good he said 

listen to me then or rather answer me 

put your question 

can you tell me what imit is for i realli do not know 

a like thing then that i should know 

whi not for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the 
keener 

veri true he said but in your presenc even if i had ani faint 
notion i could not muster courag to utter it will you enquir 
yourself 

well then shall we begin the enquiri in our usual manner whenev a 
number of individu have a common name we assum them to have also a 
correspond idea or form do you understand me 

i do 

let u take ani common instanc there are bed and tabl in the 
world plenti of them are there not 

ye 

but there are onli two idea or form of them one the idea of a bed 
the other of a tabl 

true 

and the maker of either of them make a bed or he make a tabl for our 
use in accord with the idea that is our way of speak in thi 
and similar instanc but no artif make the idea themselv how 
could he 

imposs 

and there is anoth artist i should like to know what you would say 
of him 

who is he 

one who is the maker of all the work of all other workman 

what an extraordinari man 

wait a littl and there will be more reason for your say so for 
thi is he who is abl to make not onli vessel of everi kind but 
plant and anim himself and all other thing the earth and heaven 
and the thing which are in heaven or under the earth he make the god 
also 

he must be a wizard and no mistak 

oh you are incredul are you do you mean that there is no such 
maker or creator or that in one sen there might be a maker of all 
these thing but in anoth not do you see that there is a way in which 
you could make them all yourself 

what way 

an easi way enough or rather there are mani way in which the feat 
might be quickli and easili accomplish none quicker than that of 
turn a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and 
the heaven and the earth and yourself and other anim and plant 
and all the other thing of which we were just now speak in the 
mirror 

ye he said but they would be appear onli 

veri good i said you are come to the point now and the painter too 
is a i conceiv just such anoth a creator of appear is he 
not 

of cour 

but then i suppo you will say that what he creat is untru and yet 
there is a sen in which the painter also creat a bed 

ye he said but not a real bed 

and what of the maker of the bed were you not say that he too make 
not the idea which accord to our view is the essenc of the bed 
but onli a particular bed 

ye i did 

then if he doe not make that which exist he cannot make true 
exist but onli some semblanc of exist and if ani one were to 
say that the work of the maker of the bed or of ani other workman ha 
real exist he could hardli be suppo to be speak the truth 

at ani rate he repli philosoph would say that he wa not speak 
the truth 

no wonder then that hi work too is an indistinct express of truth 

no wonder 

suppo now that by the light of the exampl just offer we enquir 
who thi imit is 

if you plea 

well then here are three bed one exist in natur which is made by 
god a i think that we may say for no one el can be the maker 

no 

there is anoth which is the work of the carpent 

ye 

and the work of the painter is a third 

ye 

bed then are of three kind and there are three artist who 
superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter 

ye there are three of them 

god whether from choic or from necess made one bed in natur and 
one onli two or more such ideal bed neither ever have been nor ever 
will be made by god 

whi is that 

becau even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind 
them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the 
ideal bed and not the two other 

veri true he said 

god knew thi and he desir to be the real maker of a real bed not 
a particular maker of a particular bed and therefor he creat a bed 
which is essenti and by natur one onli 

so we believ 

shall we then speak of him a the natur author or maker of the bed 

ye he repli inasmuch a by the natur process of creation he is 
the author of thi and of all other thing 

and what shall we say of the carpent is not he also the maker of the 
bed 

ye 

but would you call the painter a creator and maker 

certainli not 

yet if he is not the maker what is he in relat to the bed 

i think he said that we may fairli design him a the imit of 
that which the other make 

good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from natur 
an imit 

certainli he said 

and the tragic poet is an imit and therefor like all other 
imit he is thrice remov from the king and from the truth 

that appear to be so 

then about the imit we are agr and what about the painter i 
would like to know whether he may be thought to imit that which 
origin exist in natur or onli the creation of artist 

the latter 

a they are or a they appear you have still to determin thi 

what do you mean 

i mean that you may look at a bed from differ point of view 
obliqu or directli or from ani other point of view and the bed will 
appear differ but there is no differ in realiti and the same of 
all thing 

ye he said the differ is onli appar 

now let me ask you anoth question which is the art of paint 
design to be an imit of thing a they are or a they 
appear of appear or of realiti 

of appear 

then the imit i said is a long way off the truth and can do all 
thing becau he lightli touch on a small part of them and that part 
an imag for exampl a painter will paint a cobbler carpent or 
ani other artist though he know noth of their art and if he is 
a good artist he may deceiv child or simpl person when he show 
them hi pictur of a carpent from a distanc and they will fanci 
that they are look at a real carpent 

certainli 

and whenev ani one inform u that he ha found a man who know all 
the art and all thing el that anybodi know and everi singl thing 
with a higher degr of accuraci than ani other man whoever tell u 
thi i think that we can onli imagin him to be a simpl creatur who 
is like to have been deceiv by some wizard or actor whom he met and 
whom he thought all know becau he himself wa unabl to anali 
the natur of knowledg and ignor and imit 

most true 

and so when we hear person say that the tragedian and homer who 
is at their head know all the art and all thing human virtu a well 
a vice and divin thing too for that the good poet cannot compo 
well unless he know hi subject and that he who ha not thi knowledg 
can never be a poet we ought to consid whether here also there may 
not be a similar illu perhap they may have come across imit 
and been deceiv by them they may not have rememb when they saw 
their work that these were but imit thrice remov from the 
truth and could easili be made without ani knowledg of the truth 
becau they are appear onli and not realiti or after all they 
may be in the right and poet do realli know the thing about which 
they seem to the mani to speak so well 

the question he said should by all mean be consid 

now do you suppo that if a person were abl to make the origin a 
well a the imag he would seriou devot himself to the imag make 
branch would he allow imit to be the rule principl of hi life 
a if he had noth higher in him 

i should say not 

the real artist who knew what he wa imit would be interest in 
realiti and not in imit and would desir to leav a memori 
of himself work mani and fair and instead of be the author of 
encomium he would prefer to be the theme of them 

ye he said that would be to him a sourc of much greater honour and 
profit 

then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicin or 
ani of the art to which hi poem onli incid refer we are not 
go to ask him or ani other poet whether he ha cure patient 
like asclepiu or left behind him a school of medicin such a the 
asclepiad were or whether he onli talk about medicin and other art 
at second hand but we have a right to know respect militari tactic 
polit educ which are the chiefest and noblest subject of hi 
poem and we may fairli ask him about them friend homer then we say 
to him if you are onli in the second remov from truth in what you say 
of virtu and not in the third not an imag maker or imit and 
if you are abl to discern what pursuit make men better or wor in 
privat or public life tell u what state wa ever better govern by 
your help the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgu and mani 
other citi great and small have been similarli benefit by other 
but who say that you have been a good legisl to them and have done 
them ani good itali and sicili boast of charonda and there is solon 
who is renown among u but what citi ha anyth to say about you 
is there ani citi which he might name 

i think not said glaucon not even the homerid themselv pretend that 
he wa a legisl 

well but is there ani war on record which wa carri on success 
by him or aid by hi counsel when he wa aliv 

there is not 

or is there ani invent of hi applic to the art or to human 
life such a thale the milesian or anacharsi the scythian and other 
ingeni men have conceiv which is attribut to him 

there is absolut noth of the kind 

but if homer never did ani public servic wa he privat a guid or 
teacher of ani had he in hi lifetim friend who love to associ 
with him and who hand down to poster an homer way of life such 
a wa establish by pythagora who wa so greatli belov for hi 
wisdom and whose follow are to thi day quit celebr for the 
order which wa name after him 

noth of the kind is record of him for sure socrat 
creophylu the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name 
alway make u laugh might be more justli ridicul for hi stupid 
if a is said homer wa greatli neglect by him and other in hi own 
day when he wa aliv 

ye i repli that is the tradit but can you imagin glaucon 
that if homer had realli been abl to educ and improv mankind if he 
had poss knowledg and not been a mere imit can you imagin 
i say that he would not have had mani follow and been honour and 
love by them protagora of abdera and prodicu of ceo and a host of 
other have onli to whisper to their contemporari you will never be 
abl to manag either your own hou or your own state until you appoint 
u to be your minist of educ and thi ingeni devic of 
their ha such an effect in make men love them that their companion 
all but carri them about on their shoulder and is it conceiv that 
the contemporari of homer or again of hesiod would have allow 
either of them to go about a rhapsodist if they had realli been abl 
to make mankind virtuou would they not have been a unwil to part 
with them a with gold and have compel them to stay at home with 
them or if the master would not stay then the discipl would have 
follow him about everywh until they had got educ enough 

ye socrat that i think is quit true 

then must we not infer that all these poetic individu begin 
with homer are onli imit they copi imag of virtu and the like 
but the truth they never reach the poet is like a painter who a 
we have alreadi observ will make a like of a cobbler though he 
understand noth of cobbl and hi pictur is good enough for 
those who know no more than he doe and judg onli by colour and 
figur 

quit so 

in like manner the poet with hi word and phrase may be said to lay on 
the colour of the sever art himself understand their natur onli 
enough to imit them and other peopl who are a ignor a he is 
and judg onli from hi word imagin that if he speak of cobbl 
or of militari tactic or of anyth el in metr and harmoni and 
rhythm he speak veri well such is the sweet influenc which melodi 
and rhythm by natur have and i think that you must have observ again 
and again what a poor appear the tale of poet make when strip 
of the colour which music put upon them and recit in simpl prose 

ye he said 

they are like face which were never realli beauti but onli 
bloom and now the bloom of youth ha pa away from them 

exactli 

here is anoth point the imit or maker of the imag know noth 
of true exist he know appear onli am i not right 

ye 

then let u have a clear understand and not be satisfi with half 
an explan 

proceed 

of the painter we say that he will paint rein and he will paint a bit 

ye 

and the worker in leather and brass will make them 

certainli 

but doe the painter know the right form of the bit and rein nay 
hardli even the worker in brass and leather who make them onli the 
horseman who know how to use them he know their right form 

most true 

and may we not say the same of all thing 

what 

that there are three art which are concern with all thing one which 
u anoth which make a third which imit them 

ye 

and the excel or beauti or truth of everi structur anim or 
inanim and of everi action of man is rel to the use for which 
natur or the artist ha intend them 

true 

then the user of them must have the greatest experi of them and 
he must indic to the maker the good or bad qualiti which develop 
themselv in use for exampl the flute player will tell the 
flute maker which of hi flute is satisfactori to the perform he 
will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to 
hi instruct 

of cour 

the one know and therefor speak with author about the good and 
bad of flute while the other confid in him will do what he is 
told by him 

true 

the instrument is the same but about the excel or bad of it 
the maker will onli attain to a correct belief and thi he will gain 
from him who know by talk to him and be compel to hear what 
he ha to say wherea the user will have knowledg 

true 

but will the imit have either will he know from use whether or no 
hi draw is correct or beauti or will he have right opinion 
from be compel to associ with anoth who know and give him 
instruct about what he should draw 

neither 

then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledg about 
the good or bad of hi imit 

i suppo not 

the imit artist will be in a brilliant state of intellig about 
hi own creation 

nay veri much the rever 

and still he will go on imit without know what make a thing 
good or bad and may be expect therefor to imit onli that which 
appear to be good to the ignor multitud 

just so 

thu far then we are pretti well agr that the imit ha no 
knowledg worth mention of what he imit imit is onli a kind 
of play or sport and the tragic poet whether they write in iambic or 
in heroic ver are imit in the highest degr 

veri true 

and now tell me i conjur you ha not imit been shown by u to be 
concern with that which is thrice remov from the truth 

certainli 

and what is the faculti in man to which imit is address 

what do you mean 

i will explain the bodi which is larg when seen near appear small 
when seen at a distanc 

true 

and the same object appear straight when look at out of the water 
and crook when in the water and the concav becom convex owe to 
the illu about colour to which the sight is liabl thu everi sort 
of confu is reveal within u and thi is that weak of the 
human mind on which the art of conjur and of deceiv by light and 
shadow and other ingeni devic impo have an effect upon u 
like magic 

true 

and the art of measur and number and weigh come to the 
rescu of the human understand there is the beauti of them and the 
appar greater or le or more or heavier no longer have the masteri 
over u but give way befor calcul and measur and weight 

most true 

and thi sure must be the work of the calcul and ration 
principl in the soul 

to be sure 

and when thi principl measur and certifi that some thing are 
equal or that some are greater or le than other there occur an 
appar contradict 

true 

but were we not say that such a contradict is imposs the same 
faculti cannot have contrari opinion at the same time about the same 
thing 

veri true 

then that part of the soul which ha an opinion contrari to measur is 
not the same with that which ha an opinion in accord with measur 

true 

and the better part of the soul is like to be that which trust to 
measur and calcul 

certainli 

and that which is oppo to them is one of the inferior principl of 
the soul 

no doubt 

thi wa the conclu at which i wa seek to arriv when i said 
that paint or draw and imit in gener when do their own 
proper work are far remov from truth and the companion and friend 
and associ of a principl within u which is equal remov from 
reason and that they have no true or healthi aim 

exactli 

the imit art is an inferior who marri an inferior and ha 
inferior offspr 

veri true 

and is thi confin to the sight onli or doe it extend to the hear 
also relat in fact to what we term poetri 

probabl the same would be true of poetri 

do not reli i said on a probabl deriv from the analog of 
paint but let u examin further and see whether the faculti with 
which poetic imit is concern is good or bad 

by all mean 

we may state the question thu imit imit the action of men 
whether voluntari or involuntari on which a they imagin a good or 
bad result ha ensu and they rejoic or sorrow accordingli is there 
anyth more 

no there is noth el 

but in all thi varieti of circumst is the man at uniti with 
himself or rather a in the instanc of sight there wa confu and 
opposit in hi opinion about the same thing so here also is there 
not strife and inconsist in hi life though i need hardli rai the 
question again for i rememb that all thi ha been alreadi admit 
and the soul ha been acknowledg by u to be full of these and ten 
thousand similar opposit occur at the same moment 

and we were right he said 

ye i said thu far we were right but there wa an omiss which 
must now be suppli 

what wa the omiss 

were we not say that a good man who ha the misfortun to lose hi 
son or anyth el which is most dear to him will bear the loss with 
more equanim than anoth 

ye 

but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help 
sorrow he will moder hi sorrow 

the latter he said is the truer statement 

tell me will he be more like to struggl and hold out against hi 
sorrow when he is seen by hi equal or when he is alon 

it will make a great differ whether he is seen or not 

when he is by himself he will not mind say or do mani thing which 
he would be asham of ani one hear or see him do 

true 

there is a principl of law and reason in him which bid him resist a 
well a a feel of hi misfortun which is forc him to indulg hi 
sorrow 

true 

but when a man is drawn in two opposit direct to and from the same 
object thi a we affirm necessarili impli two distinct principl 
in him 

certainli 

one of them is readi to follow the guidanc of the law 

how do you mean 

the law would say that to be patient under suffer is best and that 
we should not give way to impati a there is no know whether 
such thing are good or evil and noth is gain by impati also 
becau no human thing is of seriou import and grief stand in the 
way of that which at the moment is most requir 

what is most requir he ask 

that we should take counsel about what ha happen and when the dice 
have been thrown order our affair in the way which reason deem best 
not like child who have had a fall keep hold of the part struck 
and wast time in set up a howl but alway accustom the soul 
forthwith to appli a remedi rai up that which is sickli and fallen 
banish the cri of sorrow by the heal art 

ye he said that is the true way of meet the attack of fortun 

ye i said and the higher principl is readi to follow thi suggest 
of reason 

clearli 

and the other principl which inclin u to recollect of our 
troubl and to lament and can never have enough of them we may 
call irrat useless and cowardli 

ind we may 

and doe not the latter i mean the rebelli principl furnish a 
great varieti of materi for imit wherea the wise and calm 
tempera be alway nearli equabl is not easi to imit or 
to appreci when imit especi at a public festiv when a 
promiscu crowd is assembl in a theatr for the feel repr 
is one to which they are stranger 

certainli 

then the imit poet who aim at be popular is not by natur made 
nor is hi art intend to plea or to affect the ration principl 
in the soul but he will prefer the passion and fit temper which 
is easili imit 

clearli 

and now we may fairli take him and place him by the side of the painter 
for he is like him in two way first inasmuch a hi creation have an 
inferior degr of truth in thi i say he is like him and he is 
also like him in be concern with an inferior part of the soul and 
therefor we shall be right in refu to admit him into a well order 
state becau he awaken and nourish and strengthen the feel 
and impair the reason a in a citi when the evil are permit to have 
author and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man 
a we maintain the imit poet implant an evil constitut for he 
indulg the irrat natur which ha no discern of greater 
and le but think the same thing at one time great and at anoth 
small he is a manufactur of imag and is veri far remov from the 
truth 

exactli 

but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our 
accu the power which poetri ha of harm even the good and 
there are veri few who are not harm is sure an aw thing 

ye certainli if the effect is what you say 

hear and judg the best of u a i conceiv when we listen to a 
passag of homer or one of the tragedian in which he repr 
some piti hero who is drawl out hi sorrow in a long orat or 
weep and smite hi breast the best of u you know delight in 
give way to sympathi and are in raptur at the excel of the 
poet who stir our feel most 

ye of cour i know 

but when ani sorrow of our own happen to u then you may observ that 
we pride ourselv on the opposit qualiti we would fain be quiet and 
patient thi is the manli part and the other which delight u in the 
recit is now deem to be the part of a woman 

veri true he said 

now can we be right in prai and admir anoth who is do that 
which ani one of u would abomin and be asham of in hi own person 

no he said that is certainli not reason 

nay i said quit reason from one point of view 

what point of view 

if you consid i said that when in misfortun we feel a natur 
hunger and desir to reliev our sorrow by weep and lament and 
that thi feel which is kept under control in our own calam is 
satisfi and delight by the poet the better natur in each of 
u not have been suffici train by reason or habit allow the 
sympathet element to break loo becau the sorrow is anoth s 
and the spectat fanci that there can be no disgrac to himself in 
prai and piti ani one who come tell him what a good man he 
is and make a fuss about hi troubl he think that the pleasur 
is a gain and whi should he be supercili and lose thi and the poem 
too few person ever reflect a i should imagin that from the evil 
of other men someth of evil is commun to themselv and so 
the feel of sorrow which ha gather strength at the sight of the 
misfortun of other is with difficulti repress in our own 

how veri true 

and doe not the same hold also of the ridicul there are jest which 
you would be asham to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or 
ind in privat when you hear them you are greatli amu by them 
and are not at all disgust at their unseemli the case of piti 
is repeat there is a principl in human natur which is dispo to 
rai a laugh and thi which you onc restrain by reason becau you 
were afraid of be thought a buffoon is now let out again and 
have stimul the risibl faculti at the theatr you are betray 
unconsci to yourself into play the comic poet at home 

quit true he said 

and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affect 
of desir and pain and pleasur which are held to be insepar 
from everi action in all of them poetri feed and water the passion 
instead of dri them up she let them rule although they ought to be 
control if mankind are ever to increa in happi and virtu 

i cannot deni it 

therefor glaucon i said whenev you meet with ani of the eulogist 
of homer declar that he ha been the educ of hella and that he 
is profit for educ and for the order of human thing and 
that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and 
regul your whole life accord to him we may love and honour those 
who say these thing they are excel peopl a far a their light 
extend and we are readi to acknowledg that homer is the greatest 
of poet and first of tragedi writer but we must remain firm in our 
convict that hymn to the god and prai of famou men are the onli 
poetri which ought to be admit into our state for if you go beyond 
thi and allow the honey muse to enter either in epic or lyric ver 
not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever 
been deem best but pleasur and pain will be the ruler in our state 

that is most true he said 

and now sinc we have revert to the subject of poetri let thi our 
defenc serv to show the reason of our former judgment in 
send away out of our state an art have the tendenc which we have 
describ for reason constrain u but that she may not imput to u 
ani harsh or want of polit let u tell her that there is an 
ancient quarrel between philosophi and poetri of which there are mani 
proof such a the say of the yelp hound howl at her lord 
or of one mighti in the vain talk of fool and the mob of sage 
circumv zeu and the subtl thinker who are beggar after 
all and there are innum other sign of ancient enmiti between 
them notwithstand thi let u assur our sweet friend and the 
sister art of imit that if she will onli prove her titl to exist 
in a well order state we shall be delight to receiv her we are 
veri consciou of her charm but we may not on that account betray the 
truth i dare say glaucon that you are a much charm by her a i am 
especi when she appear in homer 

ye ind i am greatli charm 

shall i propo then that she be allow to return from exil but 
upon thi condit onli that she make a defenc of herself in lyric 
or some other metr 

certainli 

and we may further grant to those of her defend who are lover of 
poetri and yet not poet the permiss to speak in prose on her behalf 
let them show not onli that she is pleasant but also use to state 
and to human life and we will listen in a kindli spirit for if thi 
can be prove we shall sure be the gainer i mean if there is a use 
in poetri a well a a delight 

certainli he said we shall be the gainer 

if her defenc fail then my dear friend like other person who are 
enamour of someth but put a restraint upon themselv when they 
think their desir are oppo to their interest so too must we after 
the manner of lover give her up though not without a struggl we too 
are inspir by that love of poetri which the educ of nobl state 
ha implant in u and therefor we would have her appear at her best 
and truest but so long a she is unabl to make good her defenc 
thi argument of our shall be a charm to u which we will repeat to 
ourselv while we listen to her strain that we may not fall away into 
the childish love of her which captiv the mani at all event we 
are well awar that poetri be such a we have describ is not to be 
regard seriou a attain to the truth and he who listen to her 
fear for the safeti of the citi which is within him should be on hi 
guard against her seduct and make our word hi law 

ye he said i quit agr with you 

ye i said my dear glaucon for great is the issu at stake greater 
than appear whether a man is to be good or bad and what will ani one 
be profit if under the influenc of honour or money or power aye or 
under the excit of poetri he neglect justic and virtu 

ye he said i have been convinc by the argument a i believ that 
ani one el would have been 

and yet no mention ha been made of the greatest prize and reward 
which await virtu 

what are there ani greater still if there are they must be of an 
inconceiv great 

whi i said what wa ever great in a short time the whole period of 
three score year and ten is sure but a littl thing in comparison 
with etern 

say rather noth he repli 

and should an immort be seriou think of thi littl space rather 
than of the whole 

of the whole certainli but whi do you ask 

are you not awar i said that the soul of man is immort and 
imperish 

he look at me in astonish and said no by heaven and are you 
realli prepar to maintain thi 

ye i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulti in 
prove it 

i see a great difficulti but i should like to hear you state thi 
argument of which you make so light 

listen then 

i am attend 

there is a thing which you call good and anoth which you call evil 

ye he repli 

would you agr with me in think that the corrupt and destroy 
element is the evil and the save and improv element the good 

ye 

and you admit that everi thing ha a good and also an evil a 
ophthalmia is the evil of the eye and disea of the whole bodi a 
mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in 
everyth or in almost everyth there is an inher evil and 
disea 

ye he said 

and anyth which is infect by ani of these evil is made evil and 
at last wholli dissolv and dy 

true 

the vice and evil which is inher in each is the destruct of each 
and if thi doe not destroy them there is noth el that will for 
good certainli will not destroy them nor again that which is neither 
good nor evil 

certainli not 

if then we find ani natur which have thi inher corrupt 
cannot be dissolv or destroy we may be certain that of such a 
natur there is no destruct 

that may be assum 

well i said and is there no evil which corrupt the soul 

ye he said there are all the evil which we were just now pa in 
review unright intemp coward ignor 

but doe ani of these dissolv or destroy her and here do not let u 
fall into the error of suppo that the unjust and foolish man when 
he is detect perish through hi own injust which is an evil 
of the soul take the analog of the bodi the evil of the bodi is a 
disea which wast and reduc and annihil the bodi and all the 
thing of which we were just now speak come to annihil through 
their own corrupt attach to them and inher in them and so 
destroy them is not thi true 

ye 

consid the soul in like manner doe the injust or other evil which 
exist in the soul wast and consum her do they by attach to the 
soul and inher in her at last bring her to death and so separ her 
from the bodi 

certainli not 

and yet i said it is unreason to suppo that anyth can perish 
from without through affect of extern evil which could not be 
destroy from within by a corrupt of it own 

it is he repli 

consid i said glaucon that even the bad of food whether 
stale decomposit or ani other bad qualiti when confin to 
the actual food is not suppo to destroy the bodi although if the 
bad of food commun corrupt to the bodi then we should say 
that the bodi ha been destroy by a corrupt of itself which is 
disea brought on by thi but that the bodi be one thing can be 
destroy by the bad of food which is anoth and which doe not 
engend ani natur infect thi we shall absolut deni 

veri true 

and on the same principl unless some bodili evil can produc an evil 
of the soul we must not suppo that the soul which is one thing can 
be dissolv by ani mere extern evil which belong to anoth 

ye he said there is reason in that 

either then let u refut thi conclu or while it remain 
unrefut let u never say that fever or ani other disea or the 
knife put to the throat or even the cut up of the whole bodi into 
the minutest piec can destroy the soul until she herself is prove 
to becom more unholi or unright in consequ of these thing 
be done to the bodi but that the soul or anyth el if not 
destroy by an intern evil can be destroy by an extern one is 
not to be affirm by ani man 

and sure he repli no one will ever prove that the soul of men 
becom more unjust in consequ of death 

but if some one who would rather not admit the immort of the soul 
boldli deni thi and say that the die do realli becom more 
evil and unright then if the speaker is right i suppo that 
injust like disea must be assum to be fatal to the unjust and 
that those who take thi disord die by the natur inher power of 
destruct which evil ha and which kill them sooner or later but 
in quit anoth way from that in which at present the wick receiv 
death at the hand of other a the penalti of their deed 

nay he said in that case injust if fatal to the unjust will not 
be so veri terribl to him for he will be deliv from evil but i 
rather suspect the opposit to be the truth and that injust which 
if it have the power will murder other keep the murder aliv aye 
and well awak too so far remov is her dwell place from be a 
hou of death 

true i said if the inher natur vice or evil of the soul is unabl 
to kill or destroy her hardli will that which is appoint to be the 
destruct of some other bodi destroy a soul or anyth el except 
that of which it wa appoint to be the destruct 

ye that can hardli be 

but the soul which cannot be destroy by an evil whether inher 
or extern must exist for ever and if exist for ever must be 
immort 

certainli 

that is the conclu i said and if a true conclu then the 
soul must alway be the same for if none be destroy they will not 
diminish in number neither will they increa for the increa of the 
immort natur must come from someth mortal and all thing would 
thu end in immort 

veri true 

but thi we cannot believ reason will not allow u ani more than we 
can believ the soul in her truest natur to be full of varieti and 
differ and dissimilar 

what do you mean he said 

the soul i said be a is now proven immort must be the fairest 
of composit and cannot be compound of mani element 

certainli not 

her immort is demonstr by the previou argument and there are 
mani other proof but to see her a she realli is not a we now behold 
her mar by communion with the bodi and other miseri you must 
contempl her with the eye of reason in her origin puriti and 
then her beauti will be reveal and justic and injust and all the 
thing which we have describ will be manifest more clearli thu 
far we have spoken the truth concern her a she appear at present 
but we must rememb also that we have seen her onli in a condit 
which may be compar to that of the sea god glaucu whose origin 
imag can hardli be discern becau hi natur member are broken 
off and crush and damag by the wave in all sort of way and 
incrust have grown over them of seaw and shell and stone so 
that he is more like some monster than he is to hi own natur form 
and the soul which we behold is in a similar condit disfigur by 
ten thousand ill but not there glaucon not there must we look 

where then 

at her love of wisdom let u see whom she affect and what societi and 
conver she seek in virtu of her near kindr with the immort 
and etern and divin also how differ she would becom if wholli 
follow thi superior principl and born by a divin impul out of 
the ocean in which she now is and disengag from the stone and shell 
and thing of earth and rock which in wild varieti spring up around her 
becau she feed upon earth and is overgrown by the good thing of 
thi life a they are term then you would see her a she is and know 
whether she have one shape onli or mani or what her natur is of her 
affect and of the form which she take in thi present life i think 
that we have now said enough 

true he repli 

and thu i said we have fulfil the condit of the argument we 
have not introduc the reward and glori of justic which a you 
were say are to be found in homer and hesiod but justic in her own 
natur ha been shown to be best for the soul in her own natur let a 
man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyge or not and even 
if in addit to the ring of gyge he put on the helmet of hade 

veri true 

and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enum how 
mani and how great are the reward which justic and the other virtu 
procur to the soul from god and men both in life and after death 

certainli not he said 

will you repay me then what you borrow in the argument 

what did i borrow 

the assumpt that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust 
just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case 
could not possibl escap the eye of god and men still thi admiss 
ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure 
justic might be weigh against pure injust do you rememb 

i should be much to blame if i had forgotten 

then a the cau is decid i demand on behalf of justic that the 
estim in which she is held by god and men and which we acknowledg 
to be her due should now be restor to her by u sinc she ha been 
shown to confer realiti and not to deceiv those who truli po her 
let what ha been taken from her be given back that so she may win that 
palm of appear which is her also and which she give to her own 

the demand he said is just 

in the first place i said and thi is the first thing which you will 
have to give back the natur both of the just and unjust is truli known 
to the god 

grant 

and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other 
the enemi of the god a we admit from the begin 

true 

and the friend of the god may be suppo to receiv from them all 
thing at their best except onli such evil a is the necessari 
consequ of former sin 

certainli 

then thi must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in 
poverti or sick or ani other seem misfortun all thing will 
in the end work togeth for good to him in life and death for the god 
have a care of ani one whose desir is to becom just and to be like 
god a far a man can attain the divin like by the pursuit of 
virtu 

ye he said if he is like god he will sure not be neglect by him 

and of the unjust may not the opposit be suppo 

certainli 

such then are the palm of victori which the god give the just 

that is my convict 

and what do they receiv of men look at thing a they realli are and 
you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runner who run 
well from the start place to the goal but not back again from the 
goal they go off at a great pace but in the end onli look foolish 
slink away with their ear draggl on their shoulder and without 
a crown but the true runner come to the finish and receiv the prize 
and is crown and thi is the way with the just he who endur to the 
end of everi action and occa of hi entir life ha a good report 
and carri off the prize which men have to bestow 

true 

and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the bless which you 
were attribut to the fortun unjust i shall say of them what you 
were say of the other that a they grow older they becom ruler 
in their own citi if they care to be they marri whom they like and give 
in marriag to whom they will all that you said of the other i now say 
of these and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater 
number even though they escap in their youth are found out at last 
and look foolish at the end of their cour and when they come to be 
old and miser are flout alik by stranger and citizen they are 
beaten and then come those thing unfit for ear polit a you truli 
term them they will be rack and have their eye burn out a you 
were say and you may suppo that i have repeat the remaind of 
your tale of horror but will you let me assum without recit them 
that these thing are true 

certainli he said what you say is true 

these then are the prize and reward and gift which are bestow 
upon the just by god and men in thi present life in addit to the 
other good thing which justic of herself provid 

ye he said and they are fair and last 

and yet i said all these are a noth either in number or great 
in comparison with those other recompen which await both just and 
unjust after death and you ought to hear them and then both just and 
unjust will have receiv from u a full payment of the debt which the 
argument owe to them 

speak he said there are few thing which i would more gladli hear 

well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tale which 
odysseu tell to the hero alcin yet thi too is a tale of a hero 
er the son of armeniu a pamphylian by birth he wa slain in battl 
and ten day afterward when the bodi of the dead were taken up 
alreadi in a state of corrupt hi bodi wa found unaffect by 
decay and carri away home to be buri and on the twelfth day a he 
wa lie on the funer pile he return to life and told them what he 
had seen in the other world he said that when hi soul left the bodi 
he went on a journey with a great compani and that they came to a 
mysteri place at which there were two open in the earth they 
were near togeth and over against them were two other open in the 
heaven abov in the intermedi space there were judg seat who 
command the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound 
their sentenc in front of them to ascend by the heavenli way on the 
right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend 
by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbol of their 
deed but fasten on their back he drew near and they told him that 
he wa to be the messeng who would carri the report of the other world 
to men and they bade him hear and see all that wa to be heard and seen 
in that place then he beheld and saw on one side the soul depart at 
either open of heaven and earth when sentenc had been given on them 
and at the two other open other soul some ascend out of the 
earth dusti and worn with travel some descend out of heaven clean 
and bright and arriv ever and anon they seem to have come from a 
long journey and they went forth with glad into the meadow where 
they encamp a at a festiv and those who knew one anoth embrac 
and conver the soul which came from earth curiou enquir about 
the thing abov and the soul which came from heaven about the thing 
beneath and they told one anoth of what had happen by the way 
those from below weep and sorrow at the remembr of the thing 
which they had endur and seen in their journey beneath the earth 
now the journey last a thousand year while those from abov were 
describ heavenli delight and vision of inconceiv beauti the 
stori glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum wa thi he 
said that for everi wrong which they had done to ani one they suffer 
tenfold or onc in a hundr year such be reckon to be the 
length of man s life and the penalti be thu paid ten time in a 
thousand year if for exampl there were ani who had been the cau 
of mani death or had betray or enslav citi or armi or been 
guilti of ani other evil behaviour for each and all of their offenc 
they receiv punish ten time over and the reward of benef 
and justic and holi were in the same proport i need hardli 
repeat what he said concern young child die almost a soon 
a they were born of pieti and impieti to god and parent and of 
murder there were retribut other and greater far which he 
describ he mention that he wa present when one of the spirit 
ask anoth where is ardiaeu the great now thi ardiaeu live 
a thousand year befor the time of er he had been the tyrant of 
some citi of pamphylia and had murder hi age father and hi elder 
brother and wa said to have commit mani other abomin crime 
the answer of the other spirit wa he come not hither and will never 
come and thi said he wa one of the dread sight which we 
ourselv wit we were at the mouth of the cavern and have 
complet all our experi were about to reascend when of a sudden 
ardiaeu appear and sever other most of whom were tyrant and 
there were also besid the tyrant privat individu who had been 
great crimin they were just a they fanci about to return into 
the upper world but the mouth instead of admit them gave a roar 
whenev ani of these incur sinner or some one who had not been 
suffici punish tri to ascend and then wild men of fieri 
aspect who were stand by and heard the sound seiz and carri 
them off and ardiaeu and other they bound head and foot and hand and 
threw them down and flay them with scourg and drag them along 
the road at the side card them on thorn like wool and declar 
to the passer by what were their crime and that they were be taken 
away to be cast into hell and of all the mani terror which they had 
endur he said that there wa none like the terror which each of them 
felt at that moment lest they should hear the voic and when there wa 
silenc one by one they ascend with exceed joy these said er 
were the penalti and retribut and there were bless a great 

now when the spirit which were in the meadow had tarri seven day 
on the eighth they were oblig to proceed on their journey and on the 
fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could 
see from abov a line of light straight a a column extend right 
through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembl the 
rainbow onli brighter and purer anoth day s journey brought them to 
the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the end of 
the chain of heaven let down from abov for thi light is the belt 
of heaven and hold togeth the circl of the univ like the 
under girder of a trirem from these end is extend the spindl of 
necess on which all the revolut turn the shaft and hook of thi 
spindl are made of steel and the whorl is made partli of steel and 
also partli of other materi now the whorl is in form like the whorl 
use on earth and the descript of it impli that there is one larg 
hollow whorl which is quit scoop out and into thi is fit anoth 
lesser one and anoth and anoth and four other make eight 
in all like vessel which fit into one anoth the whorl show their 
edg on the upper side and on their lower side all togeth form one 
continu whorl thi is pierc by the spindl which is driven home 
through the centr of the eighth the first and outermost whorl ha the 
rim broadest and the seven inner whorl are narrow in the follow 
proport the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next 
to the sixth then come the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth 
is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth come the second 
the largest or fix star is spangl and the seventh or sun is 
brightest the eighth or moon colour by the reflect light of the 
seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercuri are in colour like 
one anoth and yellow than the prece the third venu ha the 
whitest light the fourth mar is reddish the sixth jupit is in 
white second now the whole spindl ha the same motion but a the 
whole revolv in one direct the seven inner circl move slowli in 
the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swift 
are the seventh sixth and fifth which move togeth third in 
swift appear to move accord to the law of thi rever motion 
the fourth the third appear fourth and the second fifth the spindl 
turn on the knee of necess and on the upper surfac of each circl 
is a siren who go round with them hymn a singl tone or note the 
eight togeth form one harmoni and round about at equal interv 
there is anoth band three in number each sit upon her throne 
these are the fate daughter of necess who are cloth in white 
robe and have chaplet upon their head lachesi and clotho 
and atropo who accompani with their voic the harmoni of the 
siren lachesi sing of the past clotho of the present atropo of 
the futur clotho from time to time assist with a touch of her right 
hand the revolut of the outer circl of the whorl or spindl and 
atropo with her left hand touch and guid the inner one and 
lachesi lay hold of either in turn first with one hand and then 
with the other 

when er and the spirit arriv their duti wa to go at onc to 
lachesi but first of all there came a prophet who arrang them in 
order then he took from the knee of lachesi lot and sampl of 
life and have mount a high pulpit spoke a follow hear the 
word of lachesi the daughter of necess mortal soul behold a new 
cycl of life and mortal your geniu will not be allot to you 
but you will choo your geniu and let him who draw the first lot 
have the first choic and the life which he choo shall be hi 
destini virtu is free and a a man honour or dishonour her he will 
have more or le of her the respon is with the chooser god 
is justifi when the interpret had thu spoken he scatter lot 
indiff among them all and each of them took up the lot which 
fell near him all but er himself he wa not allow and each a 
he took hi lot perceiv the number which he had obtain then the 
interpret place on the ground befor them the sampl of life and 
there were mani more life than the soul present and they were of all 
sort there were life of everi anim and of man in everi condit 
and there were tyranni among them some last out the tyrant s life 
other which broke off in the middl and came to an end in poverti and 
exil and beggari and there were life of famou men some who were 
famou for their form and beauti a well a for their strength and 
success in game or again for their birth and the qualiti of their 
ancestor and some who were the rever of famou for the opposit 
qualiti and of woman likewi there wa not howev ani definit 
charact in them becau the soul when choo a new life must of 
necess becom differ but there wa everi other qualiti and 
the all mingl with one anoth and also with element of wealth and 
poverti and disea and health and there were mean state also and 
here my dear glaucon is the suprem peril of our human state and 
therefor the utmost care should be taken let each one of u leav 
everi other kind of knowledg and seek and follow one thing onli if 
peradventur he may be abl to learn and may find some one who will make 
him abl to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choo 
alway and everywh the better life a he ha opportun he should 
consid the bear of all these thing which have been mention 
sever and collect upon virtu he should know what the effect 
of beauti is when combin with poverti or wealth in a particular soul 
and what are the good and evil consequ of nobl and humbl birth 
of privat and public station of strength and weak of clever 
and dull and of all the natur and acquir gift of the soul and 
the oper of them when conjoin he will then look at the natur of 
the soul and from the consid of all these qualiti he will be 
abl to determin which is the better and which is the wor and so 
he will choo give the name of evil to the life which will make hi 
soul more unjust and good to the life which will make hi soul more 
just all el he will disregard for we have seen and know that thi is 
the best choic both in life and after death a man must take with him 
into the world below an adamantin faith in truth and right that there 
too he may be undazzl by the desir of wealth or the other allur 
of evil lest come upon tyranni and similar villaini he do 
irremedi wrong to other and suffer yet wor himself but let him 
know how to choo the mean and avoid the extrem on either side a 
far a possibl not onli in thi life but in all that which is to come 
for thi is the way of happi 

and accord to the report of the messeng from the other world thi 
wa what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he 
choo wise and will live dilig there is appoint a happi and 
not undesir exist let not him who choo first be careless 
and let not the last despair and when he had spoken he who had the 
first choic came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranni 
hi mind have been darken by folli and sensual he had not 
thought out the whole matter befor he chose and did not at first 
sight perceiv that he wa fate among other evil to devour hi own 
child but when he had time to reflect and saw what wa in the lot 
he began to beat hi breast and lament over hi choic forget the 
proclam of the prophet for instead of throw the blame of hi 
misfortun on himself he accu chanc and the god and everyth 
rather than himself now he wa one of those who came from heaven and 
in a former life had dwelt in a well order state but hi virtu wa 
a matter of habit onli and he had no philosophi and it wa true of 
other who were similarli overtaken that the greater number of them 
came from heaven and therefor they had never been school by trial 
wherea the pilgrim who came from earth have themselv suffer and 
seen other suffer were not in a hurri to choo and owe to thi 
inexperi of their and also becau the lot wa a chanc mani of 
the soul exchang a good destini for an evil or an evil for a good 
for if a man had alway on hi arriv in thi world dedic himself 
from the first to sound philosophi and had been moder fortun 
in the number of the lot he might a the messeng report be happi 
here and also hi journey to anoth life and return to thi instead 
of be rough and underground would be smooth and heavenli most 
curiou he said wa the spectacl sad and laughabl and strang for 
the choic of the soul wa in most case base on their experi of 
a previou life there he saw the soul which had onc been orpheu 
choo the life of a swan out of enmiti to the race of woman hate 
to be born of a woman becau they had been hi murder he beheld 
also the soul of thamyra choo the life of a nighting bird on 
the other hand like the swan and other musician want to be men 
the soul which obtain the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and 
thi wa the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man 
rememb the injust which wa done him in the judgment about the 
arm the next wa agamemnon who took the life of an eagl becau 
like ajax he hate human natur by reason of hi suffer about 
the middl came the lot of atalanta she see the great fame of 
an athlet wa unabl to resist the temptat and after her there 
follow the soul of epeu the son of panopeu pa into the natur 
of a woman cun in the art and far away among the last who chose 
the soul of the jester thersit wa put on the form of a monkey 
there came also the soul of odysseu have yet to make a choic and 
hi lot happen to be the last of them all now the recollect of 
former toil had disench him of ambit and he went about for 
a consid time in search of the life of a privat man who had no 
care he had some difficulti in find thi which wa lie about and 
had been neglect by everybodi el and when he saw it he said that 
he would have done the same had hi lot been first instead of last 
and that he wa delight to have it and not onli did men pa into 
anim but i must also mention that there were anim tame and wild 
who chang into one anoth and into correspond human natur the 
good into the gentl and the evil into the savag in all sort of 
combin 

all the soul had now chosen their life and they went in the order of 
their choic to lachesi who sent with them the geniu whom they had 
sever chosen to be the guardian of their life and the fulfil 
of the choic thi geniu led the soul first to clotho and drew 
them within the revolut of the spindl impel by her hand thu 
ratifi the destini of each and then when they were fasten to 
thi carri them to atropo who spun the thread and made them 
irrev whenc without turn round they pa beneath the 
throne of necess and when they had all pa they march on in a 
scorch heat to the plain of forget which wa a barren wast 
destitut of tree and verdur and then toward even they encamp 
by the river of unmind whose water no vessel can hold of thi 
they were all oblig to drink a certain quantiti and those who were 
not save by wisdom drank more than wa necessari and each one a he 
drank forgot all thing now after they had gone to rest about the 
middl of the night there wa a thunderstorm and earthquak and then 
in an instant they were driven upward in all manner of way to their 
birth like star shoot he himself wa hinder from drink the 
water but in what manner or by what mean he return to the bodi he 
could not say onli in the morn awak suddenli he found himself 
lie on the pyre 

and thu glaucon the tale ha been save and ha not perish and 
will save u if we are obedi to the word spoken and we shall pa 
safe over the river of forget and our soul will not be defil 
wherefor my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenli way and 
follow after justic and virtu alway consid that the soul is 
immort and abl to endur everi sort of good and everi sort of evil 
thu shall we live dear to one anoth and to the god both while 
remain here and when like conqueror in the game who go round to 
gather gift we receiv our reward and it shall be well with u both 
in thi life and in the pilgrimag of a thousand year which we have 
been describ
