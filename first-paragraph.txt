Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone script

I should've known that you would be 
here, Professor McGonagall. 
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. 
Are the rumors true, Albus? 
I'm afraid so, professor. The good and the bad. 
- And the boy? - Hagrid is bringing him. 
Is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important? 
Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life. 
Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. 
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid? - No, sir.
Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol.
